However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACOPS"><Rcn>111552</Rcn><Nid>10065</Nid><HI>Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena, Germany</HI><Name>Advanced Coherent Ultrafast Laser Pulse Stacking</Name><PI>Jens Limpert</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"An important driver of scientific progress has always been the envisioning of applications far beyond existing technological capabilities. Such thinking creates new challenges for physicists, driven by the groundbreaking nature of the anticipated application. In the case of laser physics, one of these applications is laser wake-field particle acceleration and possible future uses thereof, such as in collider experiments, or for medical applications such as cancer treatment. To accelerate electrons and positrons to TeV-energies, a laser architecture is required that allows for the combination of high efficiency, Petawatt peak powers, and Megawatt average powers. Developing such a laser system would be a challenging task that might take decades of aggressive research, development, and, most important, revolutionary approaches and innovative ideas.
The goal of the ACOPS project is to develop a compact, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective high-average and high-peak power ultra-short pulse laser concept.
The proposed approach to this goal relies on the spatially and temporally separated amplification of ultrashort laser pulses in waveguide structures, followed by coherent combination into a single train of pulses with increased average power and pulse energy. This combination can be realized through the coherent addition of the output beams of spatially separated amplifiers, combined with the pulse stacking of temporally separated pulses in passive enhancement cavities, employing a fast-switching element as cavity dumper.
Therefore, the three main tasks are the development of kW-class high-repetition-rate driving lasers, the investigation of non-steady state pulse enhancement in passive cavities, and the development of a suitable dumping element.
If successful, the proposed concept would undoubtedly provide a tool that would allow researchers to surpass the current limits in high-field physics and accelerator science."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,881,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACUITY"><Rcn>185678</Rcn><Nid>12314</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands</HI><Name>Algorithms for coping with uncertainty and intractability</Name><PI>Nikhil Bansal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The two biggest challenges in solving practical optimization problems are computational intractability, and the presence

Recently, there has been a huge progress in our understanding of intractability, based on spectacular algorithmic and lower bound techniques. For several problems, especially those with only local constraints, we can design optimum

However, typical optimization problems usually involve complex global constraints and are much less understood. The situation is even worse for coping with uncertainty. Most of the algorithms are based on ad-hoc techniques and there is no deeper understanding of what makes various problems easy or hard.

This proposal describes several new directions, together with concrete intermediate goals, that will break important new ground in the theory of approximation and online algorithms.

understand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This
quest has two dimensions. The
theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to
problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when
and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different
philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent
years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections
between them.

In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between
algorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way.
On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration
to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other
NP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better.
On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit
lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive
new circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.

This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms
and computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead
to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better
understanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are
fundamental
but notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to
unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of
probabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater

Most of it is snow covered as are large continental regions for about half of the year. However, Global Change is arguably greatest in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen more than anywhere else in the last few decades. New record lows occurred in snow extent in June 2012 and sea ice extent in September 2012. Many observations show that widespread and sustained change is occurring in the Arctic driving this unique environmental system into a new state. This project focuses on the biogeochemical links between sea ice and snow and the composition and chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest ~10km of the atmosphere). This is an important topic because the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles, which scatter sunlight directly and influence cloud properties, play key roles for our climate. Additionally, changes in the composition of the troposphere also affect the so-called oxidation capacity, the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself from pollutants.
This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model. This will allow a breakthrough in our understanding of the importance of the changes for the composition and oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and climate and will allow us to calculate adjusted Greenhouse Warming Potentials that include these processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,192,911</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AUGURY"><Rcn>185668</Rcn><Nid>12026</Nid><HI>Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, France</HI><Name>Reconstructing Earth&#8217;s mantle convection</Name><PI>Nicolas Coltice</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowledge of the state of the Earth mantle and its temporal evolution is fundamental to a variety of disciplines in Earth Sciences, from the internal dynamics to its many expressions in the geological record (postglacial rebound, sea level change, ore deposit, tectonics or geomagnetic reversals). Mantle convection theory is the centerpiece to unravel the present and past state of the mantle. For the past 40 years considerable efforts have been made to improve the quality of numerical models of mantle convection. However, they are still sparsely used to estimate the convective history of the solid Earth, in comparison to ocean or atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction. The main shortcoming is their inability to successfully produce Earth-like seafloor spreading and continental drift self-consistently. Recent convection models have begun to successfully predict these processes (Coltice et al., Science 336, 335-33, 2012). Such breakthrough opens the opportunity to combine high-level data assimilation methodologies and convection models together with advanced tectonic datasets to retrieve Earth's mantle history. The scope of this project is to produce a new generation of tectonic and convection reconstructions, which are key to improve our understanding and knowledge of the evolution of the solid Earth. The development of sustainable high performance numerical models will set new standards for geodynamic data assimilation. The outcome of the AUGURY project will be a new generation of models crucial to a wide variety of disciplines."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AdOC"><Rcn>185666</Rcn><Nid>10729</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Advance Optical Clocks</Name><PI>Sebastien Andr&#233; Marcel Bize</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The proposed research program has three main objectives. The first and second objectives are to seek extreme precisions in optical atomic spectroscopy and optical clocks, and to use this quest as a mean of exploration in atomic physics. The third objective is to explore new possibilities that stem from extreme precision. These goals will be pursued via three complementary activities: #1: Search for extreme precisions with an Hg optical lattice clock. #2: Explore and exploit the rich Hg system, which is essentially unexplored in the cold and ultra-cold regime. #3: Identify new applications of clocks with extreme precision to Earth science. Clocks can measure directly the gravitational potential via Einstein&#8217;s gravitational redshift, leading to the idea of &#8220;clock-based geodesy&#8221;.
The 2 first activities are experimental and build on an existing setup, where we demonstrated the feasibility of an Hg optical lattice clock. Hg is chosen for its potential to surpass competing systems. We will investigate the unexplored physics of the Hg clock. This includes interactions between Hg atoms, lattice-induced light shifts, and sensitivity to external fields which are specific to the atomic species. Beyond, we will explore the fundamental limits of the optical lattice scheme. We will exploit other remarkable features of Hg associated to the high atomic number and the diversity of stable isotopes. These features enable tests of fundamental physical laws, ultra-precise measurements of isotope shifts, measurement of collisional properties toward evaporative cooling and quantum gases of Hg, investigation of forbidden transitions promising for measuring the nuclear anapole moment of Hg.
The third activity is theoretical and is aimed at initiating collaborations with experts in modelling Earth gravity. With this expertise, we will identify the most promising and realistic approaches for clocks and emerging remote comparison methods to contribute to geodesy, hydrology, oceanography, etc."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,946,432</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIGBAYES"><Rcn>192413</Rcn><Nid>13428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rich, Structured and Efficient Learning of Big Bayesian Models</Name><PI>Yee Whye Teh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>As datasets grow ever larger in scale, complexity and variety, there is an increasing need for powerful machine learning and statistical techniques that are capable of learning from such data. Bayesian nonparametrics is a promising approach to data analysis that is increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics.  Bayesian nonparametric models are highly flexible models with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that can be used to directly parameterise and learn about functions, densities, conditional distributions etc, and  have been successfully applied to regression, survival analysis, language modelling, time series analysis, and visual scene analysis among others.  However, to successfully use Bayesian nonparametric models to analyse the high-dimensional and structured datasets now commonly encountered in the age of Big Data, we will have to overcome a number of challenges.  Namely, we need to develop Bayesian nonparametric models that can learn rich representations from structured data, and we need computational methodologies that can scale effectively to the large and complex models of the future.  We will ground our developments in relevant applications, particularly to natural language processing (learning distributed representations for language modelling and compositional semantics) and genetics (modelling genetic variations arising from population, genealogical and spatial structures).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,918,092</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BLACARAT"><Rcn>111516</Rcn><Nid>10084</Nid><HI>Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Black Carbon in the Atmosphere: Emissions, Aging and Cloud Interactions"</Name><PI>Martin Gysel Beer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Atmospheric aerosol particles have been shown to impact the earth's climate because they scatter and absorb solar radiation (direct effect) and because they can modify the microphysical properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei (indirect effects). Radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols remains poorly quantified, thus leading to considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the earth&#8217;s climate response to the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC), mostly emitted by anthropogenic combustion processes and biomass burning, is an important component of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates show that BC may be the second strongest contributor (after CO2) to global warming. Adverse health effects due to particulate air pollution have also been associated with traffic-related BC particles. These climate and health effects brought BC emission reductions into the political focus of possible mitigation strategies with immediate and multiple benefits for human well-being.

Laboratory experiments aim at the physical and chemical characterisation of BC emissions from diesel engines and biomass burning under controlled conditions. A mobile laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art aerosol sensors will be used to determine the contribution of different BC sources to atmospheric BC loadings, and to investigate the evolution of the relevant BC properties with atmospheric aging during transport from sources to remote areas. The interactions of BC particles with clouds as a function of BC properties will be investigated with in-situ measurements by operating quantitative single particle instruments behind a novel sampling inlet, which makes selective sampling of interstitial, cloud droplet residual or ice crystal residual particles possible. Above experimental studies aim at improving our understanding of BC&#8217;s atmospheric life cycle and will be used in model simulations for quantitatively assessing the atmospheric impacts of BC."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,015</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model.

Such thinking creates new challenges for physicists, driven by the groundbreaking nature of the anticipated application. In the case of laser physics, one of these applications is laser wake-field particle acceleration and possible future uses thereof, such as in collider experiments, or for medical applications such as cancer treatment. To accelerate electrons and positrons to TeV-energies, a laser architecture is required that allows for the combination of high efficiency, Petawatt peak powers, and Megawatt average powers. Developing such a laser system would be a challenging task that might take decades of aggressive research, development, and, most important, revolutionary approaches and innovative ideas.
The goal of the ACOPS project is to develop a compact, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective high-average and high-peak power ultra-short pulse laser concept.
The proposed approach to this goal relies on the spatially and temporally separated amplification of ultrashort laser pulses in waveguide structures, followed by coherent combination into a single train of pulses with increased average power and pulse energy. This combination can be realized through the coherent addition of the output beams of spatially separated amplifiers, combined with the pulse stacking of temporally separated pulses in passive enhancement cavities, employing a fast-switching element as cavity dumper.
Therefore, the three main tasks are the development of kW-class high-repetition-rate driving lasers, the investigation of non-steady state pulse enhancement in passive cavities, and the development of a suitable dumping element.
If successful, the proposed concept would undoubtedly provide a tool that would allow researchers to surpass the current limits in high-field physics and accelerator science."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,881,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACUITY"><Rcn>185678</Rcn><Nid>12314</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands</HI><Name>Algorithms for coping with uncertainty and intractability</Name><PI>Nikhil Bansal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The two biggest challenges in solving practical optimization problems are computational intractability, and the presence
of uncertainty: most problems are either NP-hard, or have incomplete input data which
makes an exact computation impossible.

Recently, there has been a huge progress in our understanding of intractability, based on spectacular algorithmic and lower bound techniques. For several problems, especially those with only local constraints, we can design optimum
approximation algorithms that are provably the best possible.
However, typical optimization problems usually involve complex global constraints and are much less understood. The situation is even worse for coping with uncertainty. Most of the algorithms are based on ad-hoc techniques and there is no deeper understanding of what makes various problems easy or hard.

This proposal describes several new directions, together with concrete intermediate goals, that will break important new ground in the theory of approximation and online algorithms. The particular directions we consider are (i) extend the primal dual method to systematically design online algorithms, (ii) build a structural theory of online problems based on work functions, (iii) develop new tools to use the power of strong convex relaxations and (iv) design new algorithmic approaches based on  non-constructive proof techniques.

The proposed research is at the
cutting edge of algorithm design, and builds upon the recent success of the PI in resolving several longstanding questions in these areas. Any progress is likely to be a significant contribution to theoretical
computer science and combinatorial optimization."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,519,285</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALERT"><Rcn>191235</Rcn><Nid>10581</Nid><HI>Stichting Astron, Netherlands Institute For Radio Astronomy, Netherlands</HI><Name>ALERT- The Apertif-LOFAR Exploration of the Radio Transient Sky</Name><PI>Albert Van Leeuwen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"In our largely unchanging radio Universe, a highly dynamic component was recently discovered: flashes of bright radio emission that last only milliseconds but appear all over the sky. Some of these radio bursts can be traced to intermittently pulsating neutron stars. Other bursts however, apparently originate far outside our Galaxy. Due to great observational challenges, the evolution of the neutron stars is not understood, while more importantly, the nature of the extragalactic bursts remains an outright mystery.

My overall aim is to understand the physics that drives both kinds of brief and luminous bursts.

My primary goal is to identify the highly compact astrophysical explosions powering the extragalactic  bursts. My previous surveys are the state of the art in fast-transient detection; I will now increase by a factor of 10 this exploration volume.  In real-time I will provide arcsec positions, 10,000-fold more accurate than currently possible, to localize such extragalactic bursts for the first time and understand their origin.

My secondary goal is to unravel the unexplained evolution of intermittently pulsating neutron stars (building on e.g., my recent papers in Science, 2013), by doubling their number and modeling their population.

To achieve these goals, I will carry out a highly innovative survey: the Apertif-LOFAR Exploration of the Radio Transient Sky. ALERT is over an order of magnitude more sensitive than all current state-of-the art fast-transient surveys.

Through its novel, extremely wide field-of-view, Westerbork/Apertif will detect many tens of extragalactic bursts.

understand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This
quest has two dimensions. The
theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to
problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when
and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different
philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent
years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections
between them.

In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between
algorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way.
On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration
to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other
NP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better.
On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit
lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive
new circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.

This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms
and computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead
to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better
understanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are
fundamental
but notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to
unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of
probabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater
dialogue between the two areas, with an exchange of ideas and techniques
which leads to accelerated progress in both, as well as a deeper understanding
of the nature of efficient computation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,274,496</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ASIBIA"><Rcn>185645</Rcn><Nid>12021</Nid><HI>University Of East Anglia, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Arctic sea ice, biogeochemistry and impacts on the atmosphere: Past, present, future</Name><PI>Roland Von Glasow</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The Arctic Ocean is a vast expanse of sea ice. Most of it is snow covered as are large continental regions for about half of the year.

The goal of the ACOPS project is to develop a compact, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective high-average and high-peak power ultra-short pulse laser concept.
The proposed approach to this goal relies on the spatially and temporally separated amplification of ultrashort laser pulses in waveguide structures, followed by coherent combination into a single train of pulses with increased average power and pulse energy. This combination can be realized through the coherent addition of the output beams of spatially separated amplifiers, combined with the pulse stacking of temporally separated pulses in passive enhancement cavities, employing a fast-switching element as cavity dumper.
Therefore, the three main tasks are the development of kW-class high-repetition-rate driving lasers, the investigation of non-steady state pulse enhancement in passive cavities, and the development of a suitable dumping element.

theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to
problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when
and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different
philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent
years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections

In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between

On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration
to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other

On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit
lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive

This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms

to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better

unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of

Most of it is snow covered as are large continental regions for about half of the year. However, Global Change is arguably greatest in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen more than anywhere else in the last few decades. New record lows occurred in snow extent in June 2012 and sea ice extent in September 2012. Many observations show that widespread and sustained change is occurring in the Arctic driving this unique environmental system into a new state. This project focuses on the biogeochemical links between sea ice and snow and the composition and chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest ~10km of the atmosphere). This is an important topic because the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles, which scatter sunlight directly and influence cloud properties, play key roles for our climate. Additionally, changes in the composition of the troposphere also affect the so-called oxidation capacity, the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself from pollutants.
This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model.

Mantle convection theory is the centerpiece to unravel the present and past state of the mantle. For the past 40 years considerable efforts have been made to improve the quality of numerical models of mantle convection. However, they are still sparsely used to estimate the convective history of the solid Earth, in comparison to ocean or atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction. The main shortcoming is their inability to successfully produce Earth-like seafloor spreading and continental drift self-consistently. Recent convection models have begun to successfully predict these processes (Coltice et al., Science 336, 335-33, 2012). Such breakthrough opens the opportunity to combine high-level data assimilation methodologies and convection models together with advanced tectonic datasets to retrieve Earth's mantle history. The scope of this project is to produce a new generation of tectonic and convection reconstructions, which are key to improve our understanding and knowledge of the evolution of the solid Earth.

The first and second objectives are to seek extreme precisions in optical atomic spectroscopy and optical clocks, and to use this quest as a mean of exploration in atomic physics. The third objective is to explore new possibilities that stem from extreme precision. These goals will be pursued via three complementary activities: #1: Search for extreme precisions with an Hg optical lattice clock. #2: Explore and exploit the rich Hg system, which is essentially unexplored in the cold and ultra-cold regime. #3: Identify new applications of clocks with extreme precision to Earth science. Clocks can measure directly the gravitational potential via Einstein&#8217;s gravitational redshift, leading to the idea of &#8220;clock-based geodesy&#8221;.
The 2 first activities are experimental and build on an existing setup, where we demonstrated the feasibility of an Hg optical lattice clock. Hg is chosen for its potential to surpass competing systems. We will investigate the unexplored physics of the Hg clock. This includes interactions between Hg atoms, lattice-induced light shifts, and sensitivity to external fields which are specific to the atomic species. Beyond, we will explore the fundamental limits of the optical lattice scheme. We will exploit other remarkable features of Hg associated to the high atomic number and the diversity of stable isotopes. These features enable tests of fundamental physical laws, ultra-precise measurements of isotope shifts, measurement of collisional properties toward evaporative cooling and quantum gases of Hg, investigation of forbidden transitions promising for measuring the nuclear anapole moment of Hg.
The third activity is theoretical and is aimed at initiating collaborations with experts in modelling Earth gravity. With this expertise, we will identify the most promising and realistic approaches for clocks and emerging remote comparison methods to contribute to geodesy, hydrology, oceanography, etc."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,946,432</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIGBAYES"><Rcn>192413</Rcn><Nid>13428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rich, Structured and Efficient Learning of Big Bayesian Models</Name><PI>Yee Whye Teh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>As datasets grow ever larger in scale, complexity and variety, there is an increasing need for powerful machine learning and statistical techniques that are capable of learning from such data. Bayesian nonparametrics is a promising approach to data analysis that is increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics.  Bayesian nonparametric models are highly flexible models with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that can be used to directly parameterise and learn about functions, densities, conditional distributions etc, and  have been successfully applied to regression, survival analysis, language modelling, time series analysis, and visual scene analysis among others.  However, to successfully use Bayesian nonparametric models to analyse the high-dimensional and structured datasets now commonly encountered in the age of Big Data, we will have to overcome a number of challenges.  Namely, we need to develop Bayesian nonparametric models that can learn rich representations from structured data, and we need computational methodologies that can scale effectively to the large and complex models of the future.  We will ground our developments in relevant applications, particularly to natural language processing (learning distributed representations for language modelling and compositional semantics) and genetics (modelling genetic variations arising from population, genealogical and spatial structures).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,918,092</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BLACARAT"><Rcn>111516</Rcn><Nid>10084</Nid><HI>Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Black Carbon in the Atmosphere: Emissions, Aging and Cloud Interactions"</Name><PI>Martin Gysel Beer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Atmospheric aerosol particles have been shown to impact the earth's climate because they scatter and absorb solar radiation (direct effect) and because they can modify the microphysical properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei (indirect effects). Radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols remains poorly quantified, thus leading to considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the earth&#8217;s climate response to the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC), mostly emitted by anthropogenic combustion processes and biomass burning, is an important component of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates show that BC may be the second strongest contributor (after CO2) to global warming. Adverse health effects due to particulate air pollution have also been associated with traffic-related BC particles. These climate and health effects brought BC emission reductions into the political focus of possible mitigation strategies with immediate and multiple benefits for human well-being.

Laboratory experiments aim at the physical and chemical characterisation of BC emissions from diesel engines and biomass burning under controlled conditions. A mobile laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art aerosol sensors will be used to determine the contribution of different BC sources to atmospheric BC loadings, and to investigate the evolution of the relevant BC properties with atmospheric aging during transport from sources to remote areas. The interactions of BC particles with clouds as a function of BC properties will be investigated with in-situ measurements by operating quantitative single particle instruments behind a novel sampling inlet, which makes selective sampling of interstitial, cloud droplet residual or ice crystal residual particles possible. Above experimental studies aim at improving our understanding of BC&#8217;s atmospheric life cycle and will be used in model simulations for quantitatively assessing the atmospheric impacts of BC."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,015</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-BINGOS"><Rcn>185648</Rcn><Nid>12022</Nid><HI>Foundation For Research And Technology Hellas, Greece</HI><Name>Accreting binary populations in Nearby Galaxies: Observations and Simulations</Name><PI>Andreas Zezas</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"High-energy observations of our Galaxy offer a good, albeit not complete, picture of the X-ray source populations, in particular the accreting binary sources.

The proposed approach to this goal relies on the spatially and temporally separated amplification of ultrashort laser pulses in waveguide structures, followed by coherent combination into a single train of pulses with increased average power and pulse energy. This combination can be realized through the coherent addition of the output beams of spatially separated amplifiers, combined with the pulse stacking of temporally separated pulses in passive enhancement cavities, employing a fast-switching element as cavity dumper.
Therefore, the three main tasks are the development of kW-class high-repetition-rate driving lasers, the investigation of non-steady state pulse enhancement in passive cavities, and the development of a suitable dumping element.

of uncertainty: most problems are either NP-hard, or have incomplete input data which
makes an exact computation impossible.

Recently, there has been a huge progress in our understanding of intractability, based on spectacular algorithmic and lower bound techniques. For several problems, especially those with only local constraints, we can design optimum
approximation algorithms that are provably the best possible.
However, typical optimization problems usually involve complex global constraints and are much less understood. The situation is even worse for coping with uncertainty. Most of the algorithms are based on ad-hoc techniques and there is no deeper understanding of what makes various problems easy or hard.

This proposal describes several new directions, together with concrete intermediate goals, that will break important new ground in the theory of approximation and online algorithms. The particular directions we consider are (i) extend the primal dual method to systematically design online algorithms, (ii) build a structural theory of online problems based on work functions, (iii) develop new tools to use the power of strong convex relaxations and (iv) design new algorithmic approaches based on  non-constructive proof techniques.

The proposed research is at the
cutting edge of algorithm design, and builds upon the recent success of the PI in resolving several longstanding questions in these areas. Any progress is likely to be a significant contribution to theoretical
computer science and combinatorial optimization."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,519,285</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALERT"><Rcn>191235</Rcn><Nid>10581</Nid><HI>Stichting Astron, Netherlands Institute For Radio Astronomy, Netherlands</HI><Name>ALERT- The Apertif-LOFAR Exploration of the Radio Transient Sky</Name><PI>Albert Van Leeuwen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"In our largely unchanging radio Universe, a highly dynamic component was recently discovered: flashes of bright radio emission that last only milliseconds but appear all over the sky. Some of these radio bursts can be traced to intermittently pulsating neutron stars. Other bursts however, apparently originate far outside our Galaxy. Due to great observational challenges, the evolution of the neutron stars is not understood, while more importantly, the nature of the extragalactic bursts remains an outright mystery.

My overall aim is to understand the physics that drives both kinds of brief and luminous bursts.

My primary goal is to identify the highly compact astrophysical explosions powering the extragalactic  bursts. My previous surveys are the state of the art in fast-transient detection; I will now increase by a factor of 10 this exploration volume.  In real-time I will provide arcsec positions, 10,000-fold more accurate than currently possible, to localize such extragalactic bursts for the first time and understand their origin.

My secondary goal is to unravel the unexplained evolution of intermittently pulsating neutron stars (building on e.g., my recent papers in Science, 2013), by doubling their number and modeling their population.

To achieve these goals, I will carry out a highly innovative survey: the Apertif-LOFAR Exploration of the Radio Transient Sky. ALERT is over an order of magnitude more sensitive than all current state-of-the art fast-transient surveys.

Through its novel, extremely wide field-of-view, Westerbork/Apertif will detect many tens of extragalactic bursts.

understand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This
quest has two dimensions. The
theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to
problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when
and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different
philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent
years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections
between them.

In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between
algorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way.
On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration
to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other
NP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better.
On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit
lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive
new circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.

This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms
and computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead
to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better
understanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are
fundamental
but notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to
unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of
probabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater
dialogue between the two areas, with an exchange of ideas and techniques
which leads to accelerated progress in both, as well as a deeper understanding
of the nature of efficient computation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,274,496</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ASIBIA"><Rcn>185645</Rcn><Nid>12021</Nid><HI>University Of East Anglia, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Arctic sea ice, biogeochemistry and impacts on the atmosphere: Past, present, future</Name><PI>Roland Von Glasow</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The Arctic Ocean is a vast expanse of sea ice. Most of it is snow covered as are large continental regions for about half of the year. However, Global Change is arguably greatest in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen more than anywhere else in the last few decades. New record lows occurred in snow extent in June 2012 and sea ice extent in September 2012. Many observations show that widespread and sustained change is occurring in the Arctic driving this unique environmental system into a new state. This project focuses on the biogeochemical links between sea ice and snow and the composition and chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest ~10km of the atmosphere). This is an important topic because the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles, which scatter sunlight directly and influence cloud properties, play key roles for our climate. Additionally, changes in the composition of the troposphere also affect the so-called oxidation capacity, the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself from pollutants.
This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model. This will allow a breakthrough in our understanding of the importance of the changes for the composition and oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and climate and will allow us to calculate adjusted Greenhouse Warming Potentials that include these processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,192,911</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AUGURY"><Rcn>185668</Rcn><Nid>12026</Nid><HI>Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, France</HI><Name>Reconstructing Earth&#8217;s mantle convection</Name><PI>Nicolas Coltice</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowledge of the state of the Earth mantle and its temporal evolution is fundamental to a variety of disciplines in Earth Sciences, from the internal dynamics to its many expressions in the geological record (postglacial rebound, sea level change, ore deposit, tectonics or geomagnetic reversals).

This combination can be realized through the coherent addition of the output beams of spatially separated amplifiers, combined with the pulse stacking of temporally separated pulses in passive enhancement cavities, employing a fast-switching element as cavity dumper.
Therefore, the three main tasks are the development of kW-class high-repetition-rate driving lasers, the investigation of non-steady state pulse enhancement in passive cavities, and the development of a suitable dumping element.
If successful, the proposed concept would undoubtedly provide a tool that would allow researchers to surpass the current limits in high-field physics and accelerator science."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,881,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACUITY"><Rcn>185678</Rcn><Nid>12314</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands</HI><Name>Algorithms for coping with uncertainty and intractability</Name><PI>Nikhil Bansal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The two biggest challenges in solving practical optimization problems are computational intractability, and the presence
of uncertainty: most problems are either NP-hard, or have incomplete input data which
makes an exact computation impossible.

Recently, there has been a huge progress in our understanding of intractability, based on spectacular algorithmic and lower bound techniques. For several problems, especially those with only local constraints, we can design optimum
approximation algorithms that are provably the best possible.
However, typical optimization problems usually involve complex global constraints and are much less understood. The situation is even worse for coping with uncertainty. Most of the algorithms are based on ad-hoc techniques and there is no deeper understanding of what makes various problems easy or hard.

This proposal describes several new directions, together with concrete intermediate goals, that will break important new ground in the theory of approximation and online algorithms. The particular directions we consider are (i) extend the primal dual method to systematically design online algorithms, (ii) build a structural theory of online problems based on work functions, (iii) develop new tools to use the power of strong convex relaxations and (iv) design new algorithmic approaches based on  non-constructive proof techniques.

The proposed research is at the
cutting edge of algorithm design, and builds upon the recent success of the PI in resolving several longstanding questions in these areas. Any progress is likely to be a significant contribution to theoretical
computer science and combinatorial optimization."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,519,285</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALERT"><Rcn>191235</Rcn><Nid>10581</Nid><HI>Stichting Astron, Netherlands Institute For Radio Astronomy, Netherlands</HI><Name>ALERT- The Apertif-LOFAR Exploration of the Radio Transient Sky</Name><PI>Albert Van Leeuwen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"In our largely unchanging radio Universe, a highly dynamic component was recently discovered: flashes of bright radio emission that last only milliseconds but appear all over the sky. Some of these radio bursts can be traced to intermittently pulsating neutron stars. Other bursts however, apparently originate far outside our Galaxy. Due to great observational challenges, the evolution of the neutron stars is not understood, while more importantly, the nature of the extragalactic bursts remains an outright mystery.

My overall aim is to understand the physics that drives both kinds of brief and luminous bursts.

My primary goal is to identify the highly compact astrophysical explosions powering the extragalactic  bursts. My previous surveys are the state of the art in fast-transient detection; I will now increase by a factor of 10 this exploration volume.  In real-time I will provide arcsec positions, 10,000-fold more accurate than currently possible, to localize such extragalactic bursts for the first time and understand their origin.

My secondary goal is to unravel the unexplained evolution of intermittently pulsating neutron stars (building on e.g., my recent papers in Science, 2013), by doubling their number and modeling their population.

To achieve these goals, I will carry out a highly innovative survey: the Apertif-LOFAR Exploration of the Radio Transient Sky. ALERT is over an order of magnitude more sensitive than all current state-of-the art fast-transient surveys.

Through its novel, extremely wide field-of-view, Westerbork/Apertif will detect many tens of extragalactic bursts. Through real-time triggers to LOFAR I will next provide the precise localisation that is essential for radio, optical and high-energy follow-up to, for the first time, shed light on the physics and objects driving these bursts &#8211; evaporating primordial black holes; explosions in host galaxies; or, the unknown?"</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,823</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALUNIF"><Rcn>111544</Rcn><Nid>11829</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Algorithms and Lower Bounds: A Unified Approach</Name><PI>Rahul Santhanam</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the fundamental goals of theoretical computer science is to
understand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This
quest has two dimensions. The
theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to
problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when
and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different
philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent
years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections
between them.

In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between
algorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way.
On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration
to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other
NP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better.
On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit
lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive
new circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.

This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms
and computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead
to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better
understanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are
fundamental
but notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to
unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of
probabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater
dialogue between the two areas, with an exchange of ideas and techniques
which leads to accelerated progress in both, as well as a deeper understanding
of the nature of efficient computation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,274,496</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ASIBIA"><Rcn>185645</Rcn><Nid>12021</Nid><HI>University Of East Anglia, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Arctic sea ice, biogeochemistry and impacts on the atmosphere: Past, present, future</Name><PI>Roland Von Glasow</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The Arctic Ocean is a vast expanse of sea ice. Most of it is snow covered as are large continental regions for about half of the year. However, Global Change is arguably greatest in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen more than anywhere else in the last few decades. New record lows occurred in snow extent in June 2012 and sea ice extent in September 2012. Many observations show that widespread and sustained change is occurring in the Arctic driving this unique environmental system into a new state. This project focuses on the biogeochemical links between sea ice and snow and the composition and chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest ~10km of the atmosphere). This is an important topic because the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles, which scatter sunlight directly and influence cloud properties, play key roles for our climate. Additionally, changes in the composition of the troposphere also affect the so-called oxidation capacity, the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself from pollutants.
This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model. This will allow a breakthrough in our understanding of the importance of the changes for the composition and oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and climate and will allow us to calculate adjusted Greenhouse Warming Potentials that include these processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,192,911</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AUGURY"><Rcn>185668</Rcn><Nid>12026</Nid><HI>Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, France</HI><Name>Reconstructing Earth&#8217;s mantle convection</Name><PI>Nicolas Coltice</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowledge of the state of the Earth mantle and its temporal evolution is fundamental to a variety of disciplines in Earth Sciences, from the internal dynamics to its many expressions in the geological record (postglacial rebound, sea level change, ore deposit, tectonics or geomagnetic reversals). Mantle convection theory is the centerpiece to unravel the present and past state of the mantle. For the past 40 years considerable efforts have been made to improve the quality of numerical models of mantle convection. However, they are still sparsely used to estimate the convective history of the solid Earth, in comparison to ocean or atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction. The main shortcoming is their inability to successfully produce Earth-like seafloor spreading and continental drift self-consistently. Recent convection models have begun to successfully predict these processes (Coltice et al., Science 336, 335-33, 2012). Such breakthrough opens the opportunity to combine high-level data assimilation methodologies and convection models together with advanced tectonic datasets to retrieve Earth's mantle history. The scope of this project is to produce a new generation of tectonic and convection reconstructions, which are key to improve our understanding and knowledge of the evolution of the solid Earth.

The first and second objectives are to seek extreme precisions in optical atomic spectroscopy and optical clocks, and to use this quest as a mean of exploration in atomic physics. The third objective is to explore new possibilities that stem from extreme precision. These goals will be pursued via three complementary activities: #1: Search for extreme precisions with an Hg optical lattice clock. #2: Explore and exploit the rich Hg system, which is essentially unexplored in the cold and ultra-cold regime. #3: Identify new applications of clocks with extreme precision to Earth science. Clocks can measure directly the gravitational potential via Einstein&#8217;s gravitational redshift, leading to the idea of &#8220;clock-based geodesy&#8221;.
The 2 first activities are experimental and build on an existing setup, where we demonstrated the feasibility of an Hg optical lattice clock. Hg is chosen for its potential to surpass competing systems. We will investigate the unexplored physics of the Hg clock. This includes interactions between Hg atoms, lattice-induced light shifts, and sensitivity to external fields which are specific to the atomic species. Beyond, we will explore the fundamental limits of the optical lattice scheme. We will exploit other remarkable features of Hg associated to the high atomic number and the diversity of stable isotopes. These features enable tests of fundamental physical laws, ultra-precise measurements of isotope shifts, measurement of collisional properties toward evaporative cooling and quantum gases of Hg, investigation of forbidden transitions promising for measuring the nuclear anapole moment of Hg.
The third activity is theoretical and is aimed at initiating collaborations with experts in modelling Earth gravity. With this expertise, we will identify the most promising and realistic approaches for clocks and emerging remote comparison methods to contribute to geodesy, hydrology, oceanography, etc."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,946,432</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIGBAYES"><Rcn>192413</Rcn><Nid>13428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rich, Structured and Efficient Learning of Big Bayesian Models</Name><PI>Yee Whye Teh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>As datasets grow ever larger in scale, complexity and variety, there is an increasing need for powerful machine learning and statistical techniques that are capable of learning from such data.

Bayesian nonparametric models are highly flexible models with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that can be used to directly parameterise and learn about functions, densities, conditional distributions etc, and  have been successfully applied to regression, survival analysis, language modelling, time series analysis, and visual scene analysis among others.  However, to successfully use Bayesian nonparametric models to analyse the high-dimensional and structured datasets now commonly encountered in the age of Big Data, we will have to overcome a number of challenges.  Namely, we need to develop Bayesian nonparametric models that can learn rich representations from structured data, and we need computational methodologies that can scale effectively to the large and complex models of the future.

Radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols remains poorly quantified, thus leading to considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the earth&#8217;s climate response to the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC), mostly emitted by anthropogenic combustion processes and biomass burning, is an important component of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates show that BC may be the second strongest contributor (after CO2) to global warming. Adverse health effects due to particulate air pollution have also been associated with traffic-related BC particles. These climate and health effects brought BC emission reductions into the political focus of possible mitigation strategies with immediate and multiple benefits for human well-being.

Laboratory experiments aim at the physical and chemical characterisation of BC emissions from diesel engines and biomass burning under controlled conditions. A mobile laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art aerosol sensors will be used to determine the contribution of different BC sources to atmospheric BC loadings, and to investigate the evolution of the relevant BC properties with atmospheric aging during transport from sources to remote areas. The interactions of BC particles with clouds as a function of BC properties will be investigated with in-situ measurements by operating quantitative single particle instruments behind a novel sampling inlet, which makes selective sampling of interstitial, cloud droplet residual or ice crystal residual particles possible.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications.

Our objective is to gain fundamentally novel mechanistic insight into the emerging new roles of integrins in cancer and to generate a road map of integrin dependent pathways critical in mammary gland development and integrin signalling thus opening new targets for therapeutic interventions. We will combine an in vivo based translational approach with cell and molecular biological studies aiming to identify entirely novel concepts in integrin function using cutting edge techniques and synthetic-biology tools.

The specific objectives are:
1) Integrin inactivation in branching morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Integrins regulate mammary gland development and cancer invasion but the role of integrin inactivating proteins in these processes is currently completely unknown. We will investigate this using genetically modified mice, ex-vivo organoid models and human tissues with the aim to identify beneficial combinational treatments against cancer invasion.

2) Endosomal adhesomes &#8211; cross-talk between integrin activity and integrin &#8220;inside-in signaling&#8221;. We hypothesize that endocytosed active integrins engage in specialized endosomal signaling that governs cell survival especially in cancer. RNAi cell arrays, super-resolution STED imaging and endosomal proteomics will be used to investigate integrin signaling in endosomes.

3) Spatio-temporal co-ordination of adhesion and endocytosis. Several cytosolic proteins compete for integrin binding to regulate activation, endocytosis and recycling. Photoactivatable protein-traps and predefined matrix micropatterns will be employed to mechanistically dissect the spatio-temporal dynamics and hierarchy of their recruitment.

Typically, transcription in leukemia cells is altered by the ectopic expression of transcription factors, by modulation of signaling pathways or by epigenetic changes. In addition to these factors that affect the production of RNAs, also changes in the processing of RNA (its splicing, transport and decay) may contribute to determine steady-state RNA levels in leukemia cells. Indeed, acquired mutations in various genes encoding RNA splice factors have recently been identified in myeloid leukemias and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

What determines the intrinsic growth potential of neurites, and how such growth is regulated during development, disease and following injury is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that intrinsic growth capability is genetically encoded, its nature remains poorly defined. Neuronal remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of various types of axon degeneration and growth. We have recently demonstrated that regrowth of axons following developmental pruning is not only distinct from initial outgrowth but also shares molecular similarities with regeneration following injury. In this proposal we combine state of the art tools from genomics, functional genetics and microscopy to perform a comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury. First, we will combine genetic, biochemical and genomic studies to gain a mechanistic understanding of the developmental regrowth program. Next, we will perform extensive transcriptomic analyses and comparisons aimed at defining the genetic programs involved in initial axon growth, developmental regrowth, and regeneration following injury. Finally, we will harness the genetic power of Drosophila to perform a comprehensive functional analysis of genes and pathways, those previously known and new ones that we will discover, in various neurite growth paradigms. Importantly, these functional assays will be performed in the same organism, allowing us to use identical genetic mutations across our analyses.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active.

Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADHESWITCHES"><Rcn>188664</Rcn><Nid>10637</Nid><HI>Turun Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Adhesion switches in cancer and development: from in vivo to synthetic biology</Name><PI>Mari Johanna Ivaska</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Integrins are transmembrane cell adhesion receptors controlling cell proliferation and migration.

Typically, transcription in leukemia cells is altered by the ectopic expression of transcription factors, by modulation of signaling pathways or by epigenetic changes. In addition to these factors that affect the production of RNAs, also changes in the processing of RNA (its splicing, transport and decay) may contribute to determine steady-state RNA levels in leukemia cells. Indeed, acquired mutations in various genes encoding RNA splice factors have recently been identified in myeloid leukemias and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

This study will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of T-ALL and may identify new targets for therapy of this leukemia. In addition, our study will provide a better understanding of how RNA processing is implicated in cancer development in general."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,300</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AXONGROWTH"><Rcn>185611</Rcn><Nid>10739</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Systematic analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury</Name><PI>Oren Schuldiner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Axon growth potential declines during development, contributing to the lack of effective regeneration in the adult central nervous system. What determines the intrinsic growth potential of neurites, and how such growth is regulated during development, disease and following injury is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that intrinsic growth capability is genetically encoded, its nature remains poorly defined. Neuronal remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of various types of axon degeneration and growth. We have recently demonstrated that regrowth of axons following developmental pruning is not only distinct from initial outgrowth but also shares molecular similarities with regeneration following injury. In this proposal we combine state of the art tools from genomics, functional genetics and microscopy to perform a comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury. First, we will combine genetic, biochemical and genomic studies to gain a mechanistic understanding of the developmental regrowth program. Next, we will perform extensive transcriptomic analyses and comparisons aimed at defining the genetic programs involved in initial axon growth, developmental regrowth, and regeneration following injury. Finally, we will harness the genetic power of Drosophila to perform a comprehensive functional analysis of genes and pathways, those previously known and new ones that we will discover, in various neurite growth paradigms. Importantly, these functional assays will be performed in the same organism, allowing us to use identical genetic mutations across our analyses. To this end, our identification of a new genetic program regulating developmental axon regrowth, together with emerging tools in genomics, places us in a unique position to gain a broad understanding of axon growth during development and following injury.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BACTERIAL SYRINGES"><Rcn>188678</Rcn><Nid>10635</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Protein Translocation Through Bacterial Syringes</Name><PI>Stefan Raunser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The main objective of this application is to study the molecular basis of cellular infection by bacterial ABC-type toxins (Tc).

In our previous cryo-EM work on the P. luminescens Tc complex we discovered that Tcs use a special syringe-like device for cell entry. Building on these results, we now intend to unravel the molecular mechanism through which this unusual and complicated injection system allows membrane permeation and protein translocation. We will use a hybrid approach, including biochemical reconstitution, structural analysis by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, fluorescence-based assays and site-directed mutagenesis to provide a comprehensive description of the molecular mechanism of infection at an unprecedented level of molecular detail.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration. In this ERC CoG proposal, we are committed to continue our efforts from basic science to biomedical approaches.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers.

In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis.

Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#8217;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#8211; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-HERO"><Rcn>185562</Rcn><Nid>12344</Nid><HI>Schweizerisches Tropen- Und Public Health-Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>Anthelmintic Research and Optimization</Name><PI>Jennifer Irene Keiser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"I propose an ambitious, yet feasible 5-year research project that will fill an important gap in global health.

Our objective is to gain fundamentally novel mechanistic insight into the emerging new roles of integrins in cancer and to generate a road map of integrin dependent pathways critical in mammary gland development and integrin signalling thus opening new targets for therapeutic interventions. We will combine an in vivo based translational approach with cell and molecular biological studies aiming to identify entirely novel concepts in integrin function using cutting edge techniques and synthetic-biology tools.

The specific objectives are:
1) Integrin inactivation in branching morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Integrins regulate mammary gland development and cancer invasion but the role of integrin inactivating proteins in these processes is currently completely unknown. We will investigate this using genetically modified mice, ex-vivo organoid models and human tissues with the aim to identify beneficial combinational treatments against cancer invasion.

2) Endosomal adhesomes &#8211; cross-talk between integrin activity and integrin &#8220;inside-in signaling&#8221;.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered.

Typically, transcription in leukemia cells is altered by the ectopic expression of transcription factors, by modulation of signaling pathways or by epigenetic changes. In addition to these factors that affect the production of RNAs, also changes in the processing of RNA (its splicing, transport and decay) may contribute to determine steady-state RNA levels in leukemia cells. Indeed, acquired mutations in various genes encoding RNA splice factors have recently been identified in myeloid leukemias and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

This study will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of T-ALL and may identify new targets for therapy of this leukemia. In addition, our study will provide a better understanding of how RNA processing is implicated in cancer development in general."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,300</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AXONGROWTH"><Rcn>185611</Rcn><Nid>10739</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Systematic analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury</Name><PI>Oren Schuldiner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Axon growth potential declines during development, contributing to the lack of effective regeneration in the adult central nervous system. What determines the intrinsic growth potential of neurites, and how such growth is regulated during development, disease and following injury is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that intrinsic growth capability is genetically encoded, its nature remains poorly defined. Neuronal remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of various types of axon degeneration and growth. We have recently demonstrated that regrowth of axons following developmental pruning is not only distinct from initial outgrowth but also shares molecular similarities with regeneration following injury. In this proposal we combine state of the art tools from genomics, functional genetics and microscopy to perform a comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury. First, we will combine genetic, biochemical and genomic studies to gain a mechanistic understanding of the developmental regrowth program. Next, we will perform extensive transcriptomic analyses and comparisons aimed at defining the genetic programs involved in initial axon growth, developmental regrowth, and regeneration following injury. Finally, we will harness the genetic power of Drosophila to perform a comprehensive functional analysis of genes and pathways, those previously known and new ones that we will discover, in various neurite growth paradigms. Importantly, these functional assays will be performed in the same organism, allowing us to use identical genetic mutations across our analyses. To this end, our identification of a new genetic program regulating developmental axon regrowth, together with emerging tools in genomics, places us in a unique position to gain a broad understanding of axon growth during development and following injury.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BACTERIAL SYRINGES"><Rcn>188678</Rcn><Nid>10635</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Protein Translocation Through Bacterial Syringes</Name><PI>Stefan Raunser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The main objective of this application is to study the molecular basis of cellular infection by bacterial ABC-type toxins (Tc). Tc complexes are important virulence factors of a range of bacteria, including Photorhabdus luminescens and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that infect insects and humans. Belonging to the class of pore-forming toxins, tripartite Tc complexes perforate the host membrane by forming channels that translocate toxic enzymes into the host.
In our previous cryo-EM work on the P. luminescens Tc complex we discovered that Tcs use a special syringe-like device for cell entry. Building on these results, we now intend to unravel the molecular mechanism through which this unusual and complicated injection system allows membrane permeation and protein translocation. We will use a hybrid approach, including biochemical reconstitution, structural analysis by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, fluorescence-based assays and site-directed mutagenesis to provide a comprehensive description of the molecular mechanism of infection at an unprecedented level of molecular detail.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration. In this ERC CoG proposal, we are committed to continue our efforts from basic science to biomedical approaches.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers.

In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis.

Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#8217;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#8211; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-HERO"><Rcn>185562</Rcn><Nid>12344</Nid><HI>Schweizerisches Tropen- Und Public Health-Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>Anthelmintic Research and Optimization</Name><PI>Jennifer Irene Keiser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"I propose an ambitious, yet feasible 5-year research project that will fill an important gap in global health.

Our objective is to gain fundamentally novel mechanistic insight into the emerging new roles of integrins in cancer and to generate a road map of integrin dependent pathways critical in mammary gland development and integrin signalling thus opening new targets for therapeutic interventions. We will combine an in vivo based translational approach with cell and molecular biological studies aiming to identify entirely novel concepts in integrin function using cutting edge techniques and synthetic-biology tools.

The specific objectives are:
1) Integrin inactivation in branching morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Integrins regulate mammary gland development and cancer invasion but the role of integrin inactivating proteins in these processes is currently completely unknown. We will investigate this using genetically modified mice, ex-vivo organoid models and human tissues with the aim to identify beneficial combinational treatments against cancer invasion.

2) Endosomal adhesomes &#8211; cross-talk between integrin activity and integrin &#8220;inside-in signaling&#8221;.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered.

Typically, transcription in leukemia cells is altered by the ectopic expression of transcription factors, by modulation of signaling pathways or by epigenetic changes. In addition to these factors that affect the production of RNAs, also changes in the processing of RNA (its splicing, transport and decay) may contribute to determine steady-state RNA levels in leukemia cells. Indeed, acquired mutations in various genes encoding RNA splice factors have recently been identified in myeloid leukemias and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

This study will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of T-ALL and may identify new targets for therapy of this leukemia. In addition, our study will provide a better understanding of how RNA processing is implicated in cancer development in general."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,300</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AXONGROWTH"><Rcn>185611</Rcn><Nid>10739</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Systematic analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury</Name><PI>Oren Schuldiner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Axon growth potential declines during development, contributing to the lack of effective regeneration in the adult central nervous system. What determines the intrinsic growth potential of neurites, and how such growth is regulated during development, disease and following injury is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that intrinsic growth capability is genetically encoded, its nature remains poorly defined. Neuronal remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of various types of axon degeneration and growth. We have recently demonstrated that regrowth of axons following developmental pruning is not only distinct from initial outgrowth but also shares molecular similarities with regeneration following injury. In this proposal we combine state of the art tools from genomics, functional genetics and microscopy to perform a comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury. First, we will combine genetic, biochemical and genomic studies to gain a mechanistic understanding of the developmental regrowth program. Next, we will perform extensive transcriptomic analyses and comparisons aimed at defining the genetic programs involved in initial axon growth, developmental regrowth, and regeneration following injury. Finally, we will harness the genetic power of Drosophila to perform a comprehensive functional analysis of genes and pathways, those previously known and new ones that we will discover, in various neurite growth paradigms. Importantly, these functional assays will be performed in the same organism, allowing us to use identical genetic mutations across our analyses. To this end, our identification of a new genetic program regulating developmental axon regrowth, together with emerging tools in genomics, places us in a unique position to gain a broad understanding of axon growth during development and following injury.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BACTERIAL SYRINGES"><Rcn>188678</Rcn><Nid>10635</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Protein Translocation Through Bacterial Syringes</Name><PI>Stefan Raunser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The main objective of this application is to study the molecular basis of cellular infection by bacterial ABC-type toxins (Tc). Tc complexes are important virulence factors of a range of bacteria, including Photorhabdus luminescens and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that infect insects and humans. Belonging to the class of pore-forming toxins, tripartite Tc complexes perforate the host membrane by forming channels that translocate toxic enzymes into the host.
In our previous cryo-EM work on the P. luminescens Tc complex we discovered that Tcs use a special syringe-like device for cell entry. Building on these results, we now intend to unravel the molecular mechanism through which this unusual and complicated injection system allows membrane permeation and protein translocation. We will use a hybrid approach, including biochemical reconstitution, structural analysis by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, fluorescence-based assays and site-directed mutagenesis to provide a comprehensive description of the molecular mechanism of infection at an unprecedented level of molecular detail.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration. In this ERC CoG proposal, we are committed to continue our efforts from basic science to biomedical approaches.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers.

In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis.

Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#8217;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#8211; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-HERO"><Rcn>185562</Rcn><Nid>12344</Nid><HI>Schweizerisches Tropen- Und Public Health-Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>Anthelmintic Research and Optimization</Name><PI>Jennifer Irene Keiser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"I propose an ambitious, yet feasible 5-year research project that will fill an important gap in global health.

Our objective is to gain fundamentally novel mechanistic insight into the emerging new roles of integrins in cancer and to generate a road map of integrin dependent pathways critical in mammary gland development and integrin signalling thus opening new targets for therapeutic interventions. We will combine an in vivo based translational approach with cell and molecular biological studies aiming to identify entirely novel concepts in integrin function using cutting edge techniques and synthetic-biology tools.

The specific objectives are:
1) Integrin inactivation in branching morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Integrins regulate mammary gland development and cancer invasion but the role of integrin inactivating proteins in these processes is currently completely unknown. We will investigate this using genetically modified mice, ex-vivo organoid models and human tissues with the aim to identify beneficial combinational treatments against cancer invasion.

2) Endosomal adhesomes &#8211; cross-talk between integrin activity and integrin &#8220;inside-in signaling&#8221;.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered.

Typically, transcription in leukemia cells is altered by the ectopic expression of transcription factors, by modulation of signaling pathways or by epigenetic changes. In addition to these factors that affect the production of RNAs, also changes in the processing of RNA (its splicing, transport and decay) may contribute to determine steady-state RNA levels in leukemia cells. Indeed, acquired mutations in various genes encoding RNA splice factors have recently been identified in myeloid leukemias and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

This study will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of T-ALL and may identify new targets for therapy of this leukemia. In addition, our study will provide a better understanding of how RNA processing is implicated in cancer development in general."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,300</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AXONGROWTH"><Rcn>185611</Rcn><Nid>10739</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Systematic analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury</Name><PI>Oren Schuldiner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Axon growth potential declines during development, contributing to the lack of effective regeneration in the adult central nervous system. What determines the intrinsic growth potential of neurites, and how such growth is regulated during development, disease and following injury is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that intrinsic growth capability is genetically encoded, its nature remains poorly defined. Neuronal remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of various types of axon degeneration and growth. We have recently demonstrated that regrowth of axons following developmental pruning is not only distinct from initial outgrowth but also shares molecular similarities with regeneration following injury. In this proposal we combine state of the art tools from genomics, functional genetics and microscopy to perform a comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying axon growth during development and following injury. First, we will combine genetic, biochemical and genomic studies to gain a mechanistic understanding of the developmental regrowth program. Next, we will perform extensive transcriptomic analyses and comparisons aimed at defining the genetic programs involved in initial axon growth, developmental regrowth, and regeneration following injury. Finally, we will harness the genetic power of Drosophila to perform a comprehensive functional analysis of genes and pathways, those previously known and new ones that we will discover, in various neurite growth paradigms. Importantly, these functional assays will be performed in the same organism, allowing us to use identical genetic mutations across our analyses. To this end, our identification of a new genetic program regulating developmental axon regrowth, together with emerging tools in genomics, places us in a unique position to gain a broad understanding of axon growth during development and following injury.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BACTERIAL SYRINGES"><Rcn>188678</Rcn><Nid>10635</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Protein Translocation Through Bacterial Syringes</Name><PI>Stefan Raunser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The main objective of this application is to study the molecular basis of cellular infection by bacterial ABC-type toxins (Tc). Tc complexes are important virulence factors of a range of bacteria, including Photorhabdus luminescens and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that infect insects and humans. Belonging to the class of pore-forming toxins, tripartite Tc complexes perforate the host membrane by forming channels that translocate toxic enzymes into the host.
In our previous cryo-EM work on the P. luminescens Tc complex we discovered that Tcs use a special syringe-like device for cell entry. Building on these results, we now intend to unravel the molecular mechanism through which this unusual and complicated injection system allows membrane permeation and protein translocation. We will use a hybrid approach, including biochemical reconstitution, structural analysis by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, fluorescence-based assays and site-directed mutagenesis to provide a comprehensive description of the molecular mechanism of infection at an unprecedented level of molecular detail.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration. In this ERC CoG proposal, we are committed to continue our efforts from basic science to biomedical approaches.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers.

In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis.

Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#8217;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#8211; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-HERO"><Rcn>185562</Rcn><Nid>12344</Nid><HI>Schweizerisches Tropen- Und Public Health-Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>Anthelmintic Research and Optimization</Name><PI>Jennifer Irene Keiser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"I propose an ambitious, yet feasible 5-year research project that will fill an important gap in global health.

Our objective is to gain fundamentally novel mechanistic insight into the emerging new roles of integrins in cancer and to generate a road map of integrin dependent pathways critical in mammary gland development and integrin signalling thus opening new targets for therapeutic interventions. We will combine an in vivo based translational approach with cell and molecular biological studies aiming to identify entirely novel concepts in integrin function using cutting edge techniques and synthetic-biology tools.

The specific objectives are:
1) Integrin inactivation in branching morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Integrins regulate mammary gland development and cancer invasion but the role of integrin inactivating proteins in these processes is currently completely unknown. We will investigate this using genetically modified mice, ex-vivo organoid models and human tissues with the aim to identify beneficial combinational treatments against cancer invasion.

2) Endosomal adhesomes &#8211; cross-talk between integrin activity and integrin &#8220;inside-in signaling&#8221;.

Overall, we thus aim to establish the interplay between tumor hypoxia and the DNA methylome."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,920,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMATINREPAIRCODE"><Rcn>185661</Rcn><Nid>12025</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>CHROMATIN-REPAIR-CODE: Hacking the chromatin code for DNA repair</Name><PI>Haico Van Attikum</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our cells receive tens of thousands of different DNA lesions per day. Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#8217;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#8211; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

What cognitive processes make this extreme flexibility possible? This is one of the most burning questions in cognitive science and the ACQDIV project aims at answering it by testing and refining the following leading hypothesis: Language acquisition is flexible and adaptive to any kind of language because it relies on a small set of universal cognitive processes that variably target different structures at different times during acquisition in every language. The project aims at establishing the precise set of processes and at determining the conditions of variation across maximally diverse languages. This project focuses on three processes: (i) distributional learning, (ii) generalization-based learning and (iii) interaction-based learning. To investigate these processes I will work with a sample of five clusters of languages including longitudinal data of two languages each. The clusters were determined by a clustering algorithm seeking the structurally most divergent languages in a typological database. The languages are: Cluster 1: Slavey and Cree, Cluster 2: Indonesian and Yucatec, Cluster 3: Inuktitut and Chintang, Cluster 4: Sesotho and Russian, Cluster 5: Japanese and Turkish. For all languages, corpora are available, except for Slavey where fieldwork is planned. The leading hypothesis will be tested against the acquisition of aspect and negation in each language of the sample and also against the two structures in each language that are most salient and challenging in them (e. g. complex morphology in Chintang). The acquisition processes also depend on statistical patterns in the input children receive. I will examine these patterns across the sample with respect to repetitiveness effects, applying data-mining methods and systematically comparing child-directed and child-surrounding speech."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADaPt"><Rcn>189849</Rcn><Nid>11805</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype: understanding the roles of climate, natural selection and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer adaptability</Name><PI>Jay Stock</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Relative to other species, humans are characterised by considerable biological diversity despite genetic homogeneity. This diversity is reflected in skeletal variation, but we lack sufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms to adequately interpret the archaeological record. The proposed research will address problems in our current understanding of the origins of human variation in the past by: 1) documenting and interpreting the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation relative to genetic phylogenies and climatic variation; 2) testing the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation among genetically related hunter-gatherers from different environments; 3) examining the adaptability of living humans to different environments, through the study of energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs associated with locomotion; and 4) investigating the relationship between muscle and skeletal variation associated with locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved by linking: a) detailed study of the global pattern of hunter-gatherer variation in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene with; b) ground-breaking experimental research which tests the relationship between energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans. The first component tests the correspondence between skeletal variation and both genetic and climatic history, to infer mechanisms driving variation. The second component integrates this skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans to, for the first time, directly test adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. ADaPt will provide the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics that may have shaped our success as a species. It will lead to breakthroughs necessary to interpret variation in the archaeological record, relative to human dispersals and adaptation in the past.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,911,485</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="APARTHEID-STOPS"><Rcn>185596</Rcn><Nid>11991</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>"Apartheid-- The Global Itinerary: South African Cultural Formations in Transnational Circulation, 1948-1990"</Name><PI>Louise Bethlehem</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal proceeds from an anomaly. Apartheid routinely breached the separation that it names. Whereas the South African regime was deeply isolationist in international terms, new research links it to the Cold War and decolonization. Yet this trend does not consider sufficiently that the global contest over the meaning of apartheid and resistance to it occurs on the terrain of culture. My project argues that studying the global circulation of South African cultural formations in the apartheid era provides novel historiographic leverage over Western liberalism during the Cold War. It recasts apartheid as an apparatus of transnational cultural production, turning existing historiography inside out. This study seeks:
&#8226; To provide the first systematic account of the deterritorialization of &#8220;apartheid&#8221;&#8212;as political signifier and as apparatus generating circuits of transnational cultural production.
&#8226; To analyze these itinerant cultural formations across media and national borders, articulating new intersections.
&#8226; To map the itineraries of major South African exiles, where exile is taken to be a system of interlinked circuits of affiliation and cultural production.
&#8226; To revise the historiography of states other than South Africa through the lens of deterritorialized apartheid-era formations at their respective destinations.
&#8226; To show how apartheid reveals contradictions within Western liberalism during the Cold War, with special reference to racial inequality.
Methodologically, I introduce the model of thick convergence to analyze three periods:
1. Kliptown &amp; Bandung: Novel possibilities, 1948-1960.
2. Sharpeville &amp; Memphis: Drumming up resistance, 1960-1976.
3. From Soweto to Berlin: Spectacle at the barricades, 1976-1990.
Each explores a cultural dominant in the form of texts, soundscapes or photographs.

This question is facing statisticians as they grapple with standardising national census methods so that their numbers can be assembled into a European population. Yet, by so doing&#8212;intentionally or otherwise&#8212;they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.

Why is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'

ARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago. At the same time it will attend to how these practices affect the constitution of who are the people of Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,833,649</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINandMINDFULNESS"><Rcn>192255</Rcn><Nid>13231</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Impact of Mental Training of Attention and Emotion Regulation on Brain and Behavior: Implications for Neuroplasticity, Well-Being and Mindfulness Psychotherapy Research</Name><PI>Antoine Lutz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Mindfulness-based therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment to reduce stress, increase well-being and prevent relapse in depression. A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#8217;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development. Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving.
I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks.
Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate.
Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,121</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CARP"><Rcn>189856</Rcn><Nid>10800</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Making Selves, Making Revolutions: Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics"</Name><PI>Martin Holbraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"What kinds of self does it take to make a revolution?

Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix.

The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level.

What does creativity mean in the context of China, and what does it do? When both the state and profoundly globalised creative industries are so deeply implicated in the promotion of creativity, what are the possibilities of criticality, if any? Whereas creativity has been extensively researched in the fields of psychology, law and neurosciences, scholarship in the humanities has by and large side-tracked the thorny issue of creativity. Yet, the worldwide resurgence of the term under the banner of creative industries makes it all the more urgent to develop a theory of creativity. This project understands creativity as a textual, a social as well as a heritage practice. It aims to analyse claims of creativity in different cultural practices, and to analyse how emerging creativities in China are part of tactics of governmentality and disable or enable possibilities of criticality.

A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#8217;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development. Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving.
I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks.
Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate.
Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,121</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CARP"><Rcn>189856</Rcn><Nid>10800</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Making Selves, Making Revolutions: Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics"</Name><PI>Martin Holbraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"What kinds of self does it take to make a revolution? And how does revolutionary politics, understood as a project of personal as much as political transformation, articulate with other processes of self-making, such as religious practices? Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics (CARP) seeks fundamentally to recast our understanding of revolutions, using their relationship to religious practices in diverse social and cultural settings as a lens through which to reveal revolutions&#8217; varied capacities for self-making. Developing a comparative matrix of revolutionary settings in the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, CARP&#8217;s core objective is to investigate the differing permutations and dynamics of revolutionary &#8216;anthropologies&#8217; in the original theological sense of the term, i.e. charting revolutionary politics in relation to varying conceptions of what it is to be human, and of how the horizons of people&#8217;s lives are to be understood in relation to divine orders of different kinds, in order to reveal how revolutions come to define what persons may be, deliberately setting the social, political, cultural and ultimately ontological coordinates within which people are made who they are. Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix. Providing much-needed empirical materials and analytical insight into the dynamic comingling of political and religious forms in the making of revolutionary selves, CARP&#8217;s ultimate ambition is to launch the comparative study of revolutionary politics as a major new departure for anthropological research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,854,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRODE"><Rcn>185583</Rcn><Nid>11387</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Corroding the social?

The project&#8217;s core goal is to provide empirical estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on four critical domains of social life, namely household incomes, demographic behaviour, educational attainment, as well as social integration and civic participation. The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level. To achieve robust causal inference, the project utilizes multilevel panel data modelling, notably two-way fixed-effects and related estimators that statistically control for unobserved heterogeneity at both the household and contextual level."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,876,758</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ChinaCreative"><Rcn>191352</Rcn><Nid>11887</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>From Made in China to Created in China- A Comparative Study of Creative Practice and Production in Contemporary China</Name><PI>Bastiaan Jeroen De Kloet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>With its emergence as a global power, China aspires to move from a &#8220;made in China&#8221; towards a &#8220;created in China&#8221; country.

What does creativity mean in the context of China, and what does it do? When both the state and profoundly globalised creative industries are so deeply implicated in the promotion of creativity, what are the possibilities of criticality, if any? Whereas creativity has been extensively researched in the fields of psychology, law and neurosciences, scholarship in the humanities has by and large side-tracked the thorny issue of creativity. Yet, the worldwide resurgence of the term under the banner of creative industries makes it all the more urgent to develop a theory of creativity. This project understands creativity as a textual, a social as well as a heritage practice. It aims to analyse claims of creativity in different cultural practices, and to analyse how emerging creativities in China are part of tactics of governmentality and disable or enable possibilities of criticality.

The book trade differs from other trades operating in the medieval and early modern periods in that the goods traded survive in considerable numbers. Not only do they survive, but many of them bear stratified evidence of their history in the form of marks of ownership, prices, manuscript annotations, binding and decoration styles. A British Academy pilot project conceived by the PI produced a now internationally-used database which gathers together this kind of evidence for thousands of surviving 15th-c. printed books. For the first time, this makes it possible to track the circulation of books, their trade routes and later collecting, across Europe and the USA, and throughout the centuries. The objectives of this project are to examine (1) the distribution and trade-routes, national and international, of 15th-c. printed books, along with the identity of the buyers and users (private, institutional, religious, lay, female, male, and by profession) and their reading practices; (2) the books' contemporary market value; (3) the transmission and dissemination of the texts they contain, their survival and their loss (rebalancing potentially skewed scholarship); and (4) the circulation and re-use of the illustrations they contain. Finally, the project will experiment with the application of scientific visualization techniques to represent, geographically and chronologically, the movement of 15th-c. printed books and of the texts they contain.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,172</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACQDIV"><Rcn>191230</Rcn><Nid>10607</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Acquisition processes in maximally diverse languages: Min(d)ing the ambient language</Name><PI>Sabine Erika Stoll</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Children learn any language that they grow up with, adapting to any of the ca. 7000 languages of the world, no matter how divergent or complex their structures are.

A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#8217;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development.

Creativity and culture have become a crucial source for innovation and financial growth, but are also mobilised to promote a new and open China to both the citizenry as well as the outside world. They are part of what is termed China&#8217;s &#8220;soft power.&#8221;
What does creativity mean in the context of China, and what does it do? When both the state and profoundly globalised creative industries are so deeply implicated in the promotion of creativity, what are the possibilities of criticality, if any? Whereas creativity has been extensively researched in the fields of psychology, law and neurosciences, scholarship in the humanities has by and large side-tracked the thorny issue of creativity. Yet, the worldwide resurgence of the term under the banner of creative industries makes it all the more urgent to develop a theory of creativity. This project understands creativity as a textual, a social as well as a heritage practice. It aims to analyse claims of creativity in different cultural practices, and to analyse how emerging creativities in China are part of tactics of governmentality and disable or enable possibilities of criticality.

The book trade differs from other trades operating in the medieval and early modern periods in that the goods traded survive in considerable numbers. Not only do they survive, but many of them bear stratified evidence of their history in the form of marks of ownership, prices, manuscript annotations, binding and decoration styles. A British Academy pilot project conceived by the PI produced a now internationally-used database which gathers together this kind of evidence for thousands of surviving 15th-c. printed books. For the first time, this makes it possible to track the circulation of books, their trade routes and later collecting, across Europe and the USA, and throughout the centuries. The objectives of this project are to examine (1) the distribution and trade-routes, national and international, of 15th-c. printed books, along with the identity of the buyers and users (private, institutional, religious, lay, female, male, and by profession) and their reading practices; (2) the books' contemporary market value; (3) the transmission and dissemination of the texts they contain, their survival and their loss (rebalancing potentially skewed scholarship); and (4) the circulation and re-use of the illustrations they contain. Finally, the project will experiment with the application of scientific visualization techniques to represent, geographically and chronologically, the movement of 15th-c. printed books and of the texts they contain.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,172</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACQDIV"><Rcn>191230</Rcn><Nid>10607</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Acquisition processes in maximally diverse languages: Min(d)ing the ambient language</Name><PI>Sabine Erika Stoll</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Children learn any language that they grow up with, adapting to any of the ca. 7000 languages of the world, no matter how divergent or complex their structures are. What cognitive processes make this extreme flexibility possible? This is one of the most burning questions in cognitive science and the ACQDIV project aims at answering it by testing and refining the following leading hypothesis: Language acquisition is flexible and adaptive to any kind of language because it relies on a small set of universal cognitive processes that variably target different structures at different times during acquisition in every language. The project aims at establishing the precise set of processes and at determining the conditions of variation across maximally diverse languages. This project focuses on three processes: (i) distributional learning, (ii) generalization-based learning and (iii) interaction-based learning. To investigate these processes I will work with a sample of five clusters of languages including longitudinal data of two languages each. The clusters were determined by a clustering algorithm seeking the structurally most divergent languages in a typological database. The languages are: Cluster 1: Slavey and Cree, Cluster 2: Indonesian and Yucatec, Cluster 3: Inuktitut and Chintang, Cluster 4: Sesotho and Russian, Cluster 5: Japanese and Turkish. For all languages, corpora are available, except for Slavey where fieldwork is planned. The leading hypothesis will be tested against the acquisition of aspect and negation in each language of the sample and also against the two structures in each language that are most salient and challenging in them (e. g. complex morphology in Chintang). The acquisition processes also depend on statistical patterns in the input children receive. I will examine these patterns across the sample with respect to repetitiveness effects, applying data-mining methods and systematically comparing child-directed and child-surrounding speech."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADaPt"><Rcn>189849</Rcn><Nid>11805</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype: understanding the roles of climate, natural selection and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer adaptability</Name><PI>Jay Stock</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Relative to other species, humans are characterised by considerable biological diversity despite genetic homogeneity. This diversity is reflected in skeletal variation, but we lack sufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms to adequately interpret the archaeological record. The proposed research will address problems in our current understanding of the origins of human variation in the past by: 1) documenting and interpreting the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation relative to genetic phylogenies and climatic variation; 2) testing the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation among genetically related hunter-gatherers from different environments; 3) examining the adaptability of living humans to different environments, through the study of energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs associated with locomotion; and 4) investigating the relationship between muscle and skeletal variation associated with locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved by linking: a) detailed study of the global pattern of hunter-gatherer variation in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene with; b) ground-breaking experimental research which tests the relationship between energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans. The first component tests the correspondence between skeletal variation and both genetic and climatic history, to infer mechanisms driving variation. The second component integrates this skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans to, for the first time, directly test adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. ADaPt will provide the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics that may have shaped our success as a species. It will lead to breakthroughs necessary to interpret variation in the archaeological record, relative to human dispersals and adaptation in the past.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,911,485</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="APARTHEID-STOPS"><Rcn>185596</Rcn><Nid>11991</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>"Apartheid-- The Global Itinerary: South African Cultural Formations in Transnational Circulation, 1948-1990"</Name><PI>Louise Bethlehem</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal proceeds from an anomaly. Apartheid routinely breached the separation that it names. Whereas the South African regime was deeply isolationist in international terms, new research links it to the Cold War and decolonization. Yet this trend does not consider sufficiently that the global contest over the meaning of apartheid and resistance to it occurs on the terrain of culture. My project argues that studying the global circulation of South African cultural formations in the apartheid era provides novel historiographic leverage over Western liberalism during the Cold War. It recasts apartheid as an apparatus of transnational cultural production, turning existing historiography inside out. This study seeks:
&#8226; To provide the first systematic account of the deterritorialization of &#8220;apartheid&#8221;&#8212;as political signifier and as apparatus generating circuits of transnational cultural production.
&#8226; To analyze these itinerant cultural formations across media and national borders, articulating new intersections.
&#8226; To map the itineraries of major South African exiles, where exile is taken to be a system of interlinked circuits of affiliation and cultural production.
&#8226; To revise the historiography of states other than South Africa through the lens of deterritorialized apartheid-era formations at their respective destinations.
&#8226; To show how apartheid reveals contradictions within Western liberalism during the Cold War, with special reference to racial inequality.
Methodologically, I introduce the model of thick convergence to analyze three periods:
1. Kliptown &amp; Bandung: Novel possibilities, 1948-1960.
2. Sharpeville &amp; Memphis: Drumming up resistance, 1960-1976.
3. From Soweto to Berlin: Spectacle at the barricades, 1976-1990.
Each explores a cultural dominant in the form of texts, soundscapes or photographs. My work stands at the frontier of transnational research, furnishing powerful new insights into why South Africa matters on the stage of global history."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,861,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ARITHMUS"><Rcn>188666</Rcn><Nid>11361</Nid><HI>Goldsmiths' College, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Peopling Europe: How data make a people</Name><PI>Evelyn Sharon Ruppert</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Who are the people of Europe? This question is facing statisticians as they grapple with standardising national census methods so that their numbers can be assembled into a European population. Yet, by so doing&#8212;intentionally or otherwise&#8212;they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.

Why is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'

ARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago. At the same time it will attend to how these practices affect the constitution of who are the people of Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,833,649</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINandMINDFULNESS"><Rcn>192255</Rcn><Nid>13231</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Impact of Mental Training of Attention and Emotion Regulation on Brain and Behavior: Implications for Neuroplasticity, Well-Being and Mindfulness Psychotherapy Research</Name><PI>Antoine Lutz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Mindfulness-based therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment to reduce stress, increase well-being and prevent relapse in depression.

What does creativity mean in the context of China, and what does it do? When both the state and profoundly globalised creative industries are so deeply implicated in the promotion of creativity, what are the possibilities of criticality, if any? Whereas creativity has been extensively researched in the fields of psychology, law and neurosciences, scholarship in the humanities has by and large side-tracked the thorny issue of creativity.

Apartheid routinely breached the separation that it names. Whereas the South African regime was deeply isolationist in international terms, new research links it to the Cold War and decolonization. Yet this trend does not consider sufficiently that the global contest over the meaning of apartheid and resistance to it occurs on the terrain of culture. My project argues that studying the global circulation of South African cultural formations in the apartheid era provides novel historiographic leverage over Western liberalism during the Cold War. It recasts apartheid as an apparatus of transnational cultural production, turning existing historiography inside out. This study seeks:
&#8226; To provide the first systematic account of the deterritorialization of &#8220;apartheid&#8221;&#8212;as political signifier and as apparatus generating circuits of transnational cultural production.
&#8226; To analyze these itinerant cultural formations across media and national borders, articulating new intersections.
&#8226; To map the itineraries of major South African exiles, where exile is taken to be a system of interlinked circuits of affiliation and cultural production.
&#8226; To revise the historiography of states other than South Africa through the lens of deterritorialized apartheid-era formations at their respective destinations.
&#8226; To show how apartheid reveals contradictions within Western liberalism during the Cold War, with special reference to racial inequality.
Methodologically, I introduce the model of thick convergence to analyze three periods:
1. Kliptown &amp; Bandung: Novel possibilities, 1948-1960.
2. Sharpeville &amp; Memphis: Drumming up resistance, 1960-1976.
3. From Soweto to Berlin: Spectacle at the barricades, 1976-1990.
Each explores a cultural dominant in the form of texts, soundscapes or photographs.

This question is facing statisticians as they grapple with standardising national census methods so that their numbers can be assembled into a European population. Yet, by so doing&#8212;intentionally or otherwise&#8212;they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.

Why is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'

ARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago. At the same time it will attend to how these practices affect the constitution of who are the people of Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,833,649</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINandMINDFULNESS"><Rcn>192255</Rcn><Nid>13231</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Impact of Mental Training of Attention and Emotion Regulation on Brain and Behavior: Implications for Neuroplasticity, Well-Being and Mindfulness Psychotherapy Research</Name><PI>Antoine Lutz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Mindfulness-based therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment to reduce stress, increase well-being and prevent relapse in depression. A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#8217;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development. Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving.
I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks.
Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate.
Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,121</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CARP"><Rcn>189856</Rcn><Nid>10800</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Making Selves, Making Revolutions: Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics"</Name><PI>Martin Holbraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"What kinds of self does it take to make a revolution? And how does revolutionary politics, understood as a project of personal as much as political transformation, articulate with other processes of self-making, such as religious practices? Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics (CARP) seeks fundamentally to recast our understanding of revolutions, using their relationship to religious practices in diverse social and cultural settings as a lens through which to reveal revolutions&#8217; varied capacities for self-making. Developing a comparative matrix of revolutionary settings in the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, CARP&#8217;s core objective is to investigate the differing permutations and dynamics of revolutionary &#8216;anthropologies&#8217; in the original theological sense of the term, i.e. charting revolutionary politics in relation to varying conceptions of what it is to be human, and of how the horizons of people&#8217;s lives are to be understood in relation to divine orders of different kinds, in order to reveal how revolutions come to define what persons may be, deliberately setting the social, political, cultural and ultimately ontological coordinates within which people are made who they are. Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix. Providing much-needed empirical materials and analytical insight into the dynamic comingling of political and religious forms in the making of revolutionary selves, CARP&#8217;s ultimate ambition is to launch the comparative study of revolutionary politics as a major new departure for anthropological research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,854,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRODE"><Rcn>185583</Rcn><Nid>11387</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Corroding the social?

The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors.

A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#8217;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention.

And how does revolutionary politics, understood as a project of personal as much as political transformation, articulate with other processes of self-making, such as religious practices? Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics (CARP) seeks fundamentally to recast our understanding of revolutions, using their relationship to religious practices in diverse social and cultural settings as a lens through which to reveal revolutions&#8217; varied capacities for self-making. Developing a comparative matrix of revolutionary settings in the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, CARP&#8217;s core objective is to investigate the differing permutations and dynamics of revolutionary &#8216;anthropologies&#8217; in the original theological sense of the term, i.e. charting revolutionary politics in relation to varying conceptions of what it is to be human, and of how the horizons of people&#8217;s lives are to be understood in relation to divine orders of different kinds, in order to reveal how revolutions come to define what persons may be, deliberately setting the social, political, cultural and ultimately ontological coordinates within which people are made who they are. Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix. Providing much-needed empirical materials and analytical insight into the dynamic comingling of political and religious forms in the making of revolutionary selves, CARP&#8217;s ultimate ambition is to launch the comparative study of revolutionary politics as a major new departure for anthropological research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,854,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRODE"><Rcn>185583</Rcn><Nid>11387</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Corroding the social?

The project&#8217;s core goal is to provide empirical estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on four critical domains of social life, namely household incomes, demographic behaviour, educational attainment, as well as social integration and civic participation. The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level. To achieve robust causal inference, the project utilizes multilevel panel data modelling, notably two-way fixed-effects and related estimators that statistically control for unobserved heterogeneity at both the household and contextual level."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,876,758</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ChinaCreative"><Rcn>191352</Rcn><Nid>11887</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>From Made in China to Created in China- A Comparative Study of Creative Practice and Production in Contemporary China</Name><PI>Bastiaan Jeroen De Kloet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>With its emergence as a global power, China aspires to move from a &#8220;made in China&#8221; towards a &#8220;created in China&#8221; country. Creativity and culture have become a crucial source for innovation and financial growth, but are also mobilised to promote a new and open China to both the citizenry as well as the outside world. They are part of what is termed China&#8217;s &#8220;soft power.&#8221;
What does creativity mean in the context of China, and what does it do? When both the state and profoundly globalised creative industries are so deeply implicated in the promotion of creativity, what are the possibilities of criticality, if any? Whereas creativity has been extensively researched in the fields of psychology, law and neurosciences, scholarship in the humanities has by and large side-tracked the thorny issue of creativity. Yet, the worldwide resurgence of the term under the banner of creative industries makes it all the more urgent to develop a theory of creativity. This project understands creativity as a textual, a social as well as a heritage practice. It aims to analyse claims of creativity in different cultural practices, and to analyse how emerging creativities in China are part of tactics of governmentality and disable or enable possibilities of criticality.

The book trade differs from other trades operating in the medieval and early modern periods in that the goods traded survive in considerable numbers. Not only do they survive, but many of them bear stratified evidence of their history in the form of marks of ownership, prices, manuscript annotations, binding and decoration styles. A British Academy pilot project conceived by the PI produced a now internationally-used database which gathers together this kind of evidence for thousands of surviving 15th-c. printed books. For the first time, this makes it possible to track the circulation of books, their trade routes and later collecting, across Europe and the USA, and throughout the centuries. The objectives of this project are to examine (1) the distribution and trade-routes, national and international, of 15th-c. printed books, along with the identity of the buyers and users (private, institutional, religious, lay, female, male, and by profession) and their reading practices; (2) the books' contemporary market value; (3) the transmission and dissemination of the texts they contain, their survival and their loss (rebalancing potentially skewed scholarship); and (4) the circulation and re-use of the illustrations they contain. Finally, the project will experiment with the application of scientific visualization techniques to represent, geographically and chronologically, the movement of 15th-c. printed books and of the texts they contain.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,172</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACQDIV"><Rcn>191230</Rcn><Nid>10607</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Acquisition processes in maximally diverse languages: Min(d)ing the ambient language</Name><PI>Sabine Erika Stoll</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Children learn any language that they grow up with, adapting to any of the ca. 7000 languages of the world, no matter how divergent or complex their structures are. What cognitive processes make this extreme flexibility possible? This is one of the most burning questions in cognitive science and the ACQDIV project aims at answering it by testing and refining the following leading hypothesis: Language acquisition is flexible and adaptive to any kind of language because it relies on a small set of universal cognitive processes that variably target different structures at different times during acquisition in every language. The project aims at establishing the precise set of processes and at determining the conditions of variation across maximally diverse languages. This project focuses on three processes: (i) distributional learning, (ii) generalization-based learning and (iii) interaction-based learning. To investigate these processes I will work with a sample of five clusters of languages including longitudinal data of two languages each. The clusters were determined by a clustering algorithm seeking the structurally most divergent languages in a typological database. The languages are: Cluster 1: Slavey and Cree, Cluster 2: Indonesian and Yucatec, Cluster 3: Inuktitut and Chintang, Cluster 4: Sesotho and Russian, Cluster 5: Japanese and Turkish. For all languages, corpora are available, except for Slavey where fieldwork is planned. The leading hypothesis will be tested against the acquisition of aspect and negation in each language of the sample and also against the two structures in each language that are most salient and challenging in them (e. g. complex morphology in Chintang). The acquisition processes also depend on statistical patterns in the input children receive. I will examine these patterns across the sample with respect to repetitiveness effects, applying data-mining methods and systematically comparing child-directed and child-surrounding speech."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADaPt"><Rcn>189849</Rcn><Nid>11805</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype: understanding the roles of climate, natural selection and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer adaptability</Name><PI>Jay Stock</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Relative to other species, humans are characterised by considerable biological diversity despite genetic homogeneity.

And how does revolutionary politics, understood as a project of personal as much as political transformation, articulate with other processes of self-making, such as religious practices? Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics (CARP) seeks fundamentally to recast our understanding of revolutions, using their relationship to religious practices in diverse social and cultural settings as a lens through which to reveal revolutions&#8217; varied capacities for self-making. Developing a comparative matrix of revolutionary settings in the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, CARP&#8217;s core objective is to investigate the differing permutations and dynamics of revolutionary &#8216;anthropologies&#8217; in the original theological sense of the term, i.e. charting revolutionary politics in relation to varying conceptions of what it is to be human, and of how the horizons of people&#8217;s lives are to be understood in relation to divine orders of different kinds, in order to reveal how revolutions come to define what persons may be, deliberately setting the social, political, cultural and ultimately ontological coordinates within which people are made who they are. Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix. Providing much-needed empirical materials and analytical insight into the dynamic comingling of political and religious forms in the making of revolutionary selves, CARP&#8217;s ultimate ambition is to launch the comparative study of revolutionary politics as a major new departure for anthropological research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,854,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRODE"><Rcn>185583</Rcn><Nid>11387</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Corroding the social?

The project&#8217;s core goal is to provide empirical estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on four critical domains of social life, namely household incomes, demographic behaviour, educational attainment, as well as social integration and civic participation. The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level. To achieve robust causal inference, the project utilizes multilevel panel data modelling, notably two-way fixed-effects and related estimators that statistically control for unobserved heterogeneity at both the household and contextual level."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,876,758</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ChinaCreative"><Rcn>191352</Rcn><Nid>11887</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>From Made in China to Created in China- A Comparative Study of Creative Practice and Production in Contemporary China</Name><PI>Bastiaan Jeroen De Kloet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>With its emergence as a global power, China aspires to move from a &#8220;made in China&#8221; towards a &#8220;created in China&#8221; country. Creativity and culture have become a crucial source for innovation and financial growth, but are also mobilised to promote a new and open China to both the citizenry as well as the outside world. They are part of what is termed China&#8217;s &#8220;soft power.&#8221;
What does creativity mean in the context of China, and what does it do? When both the state and profoundly globalised creative industries are so deeply implicated in the promotion of creativity, what are the possibilities of criticality, if any? Whereas creativity has been extensively researched in the fields of psychology, law and neurosciences, scholarship in the humanities has by and large side-tracked the thorny issue of creativity. Yet, the worldwide resurgence of the term under the banner of creative industries makes it all the more urgent to develop a theory of creativity. This project understands creativity as a textual, a social as well as a heritage practice. It aims to analyse claims of creativity in different cultural practices, and to analyse how emerging creativities in China are part of tactics of governmentality and disable or enable possibilities of criticality.

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

The thesis of the project is: that by careful control of the constituent nanostructure properties, a 3-dimensional medium can be created in which a large number of topological solitons can exist.

Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots.

The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility.

In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

The motivation is that no accurate kinetic models are available for the ignition, oxidation and combustion of 2G-biofuels, and improved ignition control is needed for new compression ignition engines. Crucial information is missing: data from well characterised experiments on combustion-generated pollutants and data on key-intermediates for fuels ignition in new engines.

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

The motivation is that no accurate kinetic models are available for the ignition, oxidation and combustion of 2G-biofuels, and improved ignition control is needed for new compression ignition engines.

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

While transport data for 2-dimensional topological insulators have recently become available, experiments on their 3-dimensional counterparts are mainly limited to photoelectron spectroscopy. At the same time, a plethora of interesting novel physical phenomena have been predicted to occur in such systems.
In this proposal, we sketch an approach to tackle the transport and magnetic properties of the surface states in these materials. This starts with high quality layer growth, using molecular beam epitaxy, of bulk layers of HgTe, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, which are the prime candidates to show the novel physics expected in this field. The existence of the relevant surface states will be assessed spectroscopically, but from there on research will focus on fabricating and characterizing nanostructures designed to elucidate the transport and magnetic properties of the topological surfaces using electrical, optical and scanning probe techniques. Apart from a general characterization of the Dirac band structure of the surface states, research will focus on the predicted magnetic monopole-like response of the system to an electrical test charge. In addition, much effort will be devoted to contacting the surface state with superconducting and magnetic top layers, with the final aim of demonstrating Majorana fermion behavior. As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

Spintronics has the potential to supersede existing storage and memory applications, and to provide alternatives to current CMOS technology. Ferromagnetic matels used in all current spintronics applications may make it impractical to realise the full potential of spintronics. Metals are unsuitable for transistor and information processing applications, for opto-electronics, or for high-density integration. The 0MSPIN project aims to remove the major road-block holding back the development of spintronics in a radical way: removing the ferromagnetic component from key active parts or from the whole of the spintronic devices. This approach is based on exploiting the combination of exchange and spin-orbit coupling phenomena and material systems with zero macroscopic moment. The goal of the 0MSPIN is to provide a new paradigm by which spintronics can enter the realms of conventional semiconductors in both fundamental condensed matter research and in information technologies. In the central part of the proposal, the research towards this goal is embedded within a materials science project whose aim is to introduce into physics and microelectronics an entirely new class of semiconductors. 0MSPIN seeks to exploit three classes of material systems: (1) Antiferromagnetic bi-metallic 3d-5d alloys (e.g. Mn2Au). (2) Antiferromagnetic I-II-V semiconductors (e.g. LiMnAs). (3) Non-magnetic spin-orbit coupled semiconductors with injected spin-polarized currents (e.g. 2D III-V structures).

This makes them potentially ideal candidates to form the basis of a new spintronics in which the soliton is the basic transport vector instead of electrical current. &#172;3.5M of funding is requested to form a new team of 5 researchers who, over a period of 60 months, will perform computer simulations and experimental studies of solitons in 3-dimensional networks of magnetic nanostructures and develop a laboratory demonstrator 3-dimensional memory device using solitons to represent and store data. A high performance electron beam lithography system (cost 1M&#172;) will be purchased to allow state-of-the-art magnetic nanostructures to be fabricated with perfect control over their magnetic properties, thus allowing the ideal conditions for solitons to be created and controllably manipulated. Outputs from the project will be a complete understanding of the properties of these new objects and a road map charting the next steps for research in the field."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,799,996</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4D IMAGING"><Rcn>94087</Rcn><Nid>13065</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Towards 4D Imaging of Fundamental Processes on the Atomic and Sub-Atomic Scale</Name><PI>Ferenc Krausz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>State-of-the-art microscopy and diffraction imaging provides insight into the atomic and sub-atomic structure of matter. They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas. The proposal A-DATADRIVE-B aims at getting end-users connected to the more advanced methods through a user-friendly data-driven black-box modelling tool.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown. Our preliminary work in a global survey of deep-sea sediments enables us now to target specific genes for the quantification of abyssal bacteria. We can trace isotope-labeled elements into communities and single cells, and analyze the molecular alteration of organic matter during microbial degradation, all in context with environmental dynamics recorded at the only long-term deep-sea ecosystem observatory in the Arctic that we maintain.

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo.

Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown. Our preliminary work in a global survey of deep-sea sediments enables us now to target specific genes for the quantification of abyssal bacteria.

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission.

Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown. Our preliminary work in a global survey of deep-sea sediments enables us now to target specific genes for the quantification of abyssal bacteria. We can trace isotope-labeled elements into communities and single cells, and analyze the molecular alteration of organic matter during microbial degradation, all in context with environmental dynamics recorded at the only long-term deep-sea ecosystem observatory in the Arctic that we maintain. I propose to bridge biogeochemistry, ecology, microbiology and marine biology to develop a systematic understanding of abyssal sediment bacterial community distribution, diversity, function and interactions, by combining in situ flux studies and different visualization techniques with a wide range of molecular tools. Substantial progress is expected in understanding I) identity and function of the dominant types of indigenous benthic bacteria, II) dynamics in bacterial activity and diversity caused by variations in particle flux, III) interactions with different types and ages of organic matter, and other biological factors."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,375,693</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACCOMPLI"><Rcn>102195</Rcn><Nid>10410</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Assembly and maintenance of a co-regulated chromosomal compartment</Name><PI>Peter Burkhard Becker</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Eukaryotic nuclei are organised into functional compartments, &#8211; local microenvironments that are enriched in certain molecules or biochemical activities and therefore specify localised functional outputs.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?   A broadly accepted model explains resistance and susceptibility to plant pathogens. First, pathogens make conserved molecules ( PAMPS ) such as flagellin, that plants detect via cell surface receptors, leading to  PAMP-Triggered Immunity  (PTI). Second, pathogens make effectors that suppress PTI.  Third, plants carry 100s of Resistance (R) genes that detect an effector, and activate  Effector-Triggered Immunity  (ETI). One effector is sufficient to trigger resistance.  Albugo candida (Ac) (white rust) strongly suppresses host defence; Ac-infected Arabidopsis are susceptible to pathogen races to which they are otherwise resistant.  Ac is an oomycete, not a fungus. Arabidopsis is resistant to races of Ac that infect brassicas.   The proposed project involves three programs. First ( genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics ), we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Solexa and GS-Flex), and novel transcriptomics methods to define the genome sequence and effector set of three Ac strains, as well as carrying out &gt;40- deep resequencing of 7 additional Ac strains.  Second, ( effectoromics ), we will carry out functional assays using  Effector Detector Vectors  (Sohn Plant Cell 19:4077 [2007]), with the set of Ac effectors, screening for enhanced virulence, for suppression of defence, for effectors that are recognized by R genes in disease resistant Arabidopsis and for host effector targets. Third, ( resistance diversity ), we will characterize Arabidopsis germplasm for R genes to Ac, both for recognition of Arabidopsis strains of Ac, and for recognition in Arabidopsis of effectors from Ac strains that infect brassica. This proposal focuses on Ac, but will establish methods that could discover new R genes in non-hosts against many plant diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown.

While it is known that this receptor mediates the toxicity of dioxin, this is unlikely to be its physiological function. We have recently identified selective expression of AhR in the Th17 subset of effector CD4 T cells. Ligation of AhR by a candidate endogenous ligand (FICZ) which is a UV metabolite of tryptophan causes expansion of Th17 cells and the induction of IL-22 production.  As a consequence, AhR ligation will exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Little is known so far about the impact of AhR ligands on IL-17/IL-22 mediated immune defense functions. IL-22 is considered a pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine, which is involved in the etiology of psoriasis, but  it has also been shown to be a survival factor for epithelial cells. AhR is polymorphic and defined as high or low affinity receptor for dioxin leading to the classification of high and low responder mouse strains based on defined mutations. In humans similar polymorphisms exist and although on the whole human AhR is thought to be of low affinity in humans, there are identified mutations that confer high responder status. No correlations have been made with Th17 mediated immune responses in mice and humans. This study aims to investigate the role of AhR ligands and polymorphisms in autoimmunity as well as protective immune responses using both mouse models and human samples from normal controls as well as psoriasis patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALBUGON"><Rcn>89114</Rcn><Nid>12460</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genomics and effectoromics to understand defence suppression and disease resistance in Arabidopsis-Albugo candida interactions</Name><PI>Jonathan Jones</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project focuses on two questions about host/parasite interactions: how do biotrophic plant pathogens suppress host defence? and, what is the basis for pathogen specialization on specific host species?

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

First, through a combination of computer-aided design, peptide synthesis and thorough biophysical characterization, we will examine the extents and limits of the alpha-helical-barrel structures.  Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.  Finally, and taking the programme into another ambitious area, we will use the alpha-helical barrels to template other folds that are otherwise difficult to design and engineer, notably beta-barrels that insert into membranes to render ion-channel and sensor functions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,467,844</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABYSS"><Rcn>103849</Rcn><Nid>10997</Nid><HI>Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz- Zentrum Fuer Polar- Und Meeresforschung, Germany</HI><Name>ABYSS- Assessment of bacterial life and matter cycling in deep-sea surface sediments</Name><PI>Antje Boetius</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The deep-sea floor hosts a distinct microbial biome covering 67% of the Earth&#8217;s surface, characterized by cold temperatures, permanent darkness, high pressure and food limitation. The surface sediments are dominated by bacteria, with on average a billion cells per ml. Benthic bacteria are highly relevant to the Earth&#8217;s element cycles as they remineralize most of the organic matter sinking from the productive surface ocean, and return nutrients, thereby promoting ocean primary production. What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown. Our preliminary work in a global survey of deep-sea sediments enables us now to target specific genes for the quantification of abyssal bacteria. We can trace isotope-labeled elements into communities and single cells, and analyze the molecular alteration of organic matter during microbial degradation, all in context with environmental dynamics recorded at the only long-term deep-sea ecosystem observatory in the Arctic that we maintain. I propose to bridge biogeochemistry, ecology, microbiology and marine biology to develop a systematic understanding of abyssal sediment bacterial community distribution, diversity, function and interactions, by combining in situ flux studies and different visualization techniques with a wide range of molecular tools. Substantial progress is expected in understanding I) identity and function of the dominant types of indigenous benthic bacteria, II) dynamics in bacterial activity and diversity caused by variations in particle flux, III) interactions with different types and ages of organic matter, and other biological factors."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,375,693</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACCOMPLI"><Rcn>102195</Rcn><Nid>10410</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Assembly and maintenance of a co-regulated chromosomal compartment</Name><PI>Peter Burkhard Becker</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Eukaryotic nuclei are organised into functional compartments, &#8211; local microenvironments that are enriched in certain molecules or biochemical activities and therefore specify localised functional outputs. Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#8216;signatures&#8217; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo. By biochemical and cellular reconstitution will test the hypothesis that roX-encoded RNA aptamers orchestrate the assembly of the DCC and contribute to the exquisite targeting of the complex."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,770</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACMO"><Rcn>98594</Rcn><Nid>12835</Nid><HI>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic dissection of molecular machines and neural circuits coordinating C. elegans aggregation behaviour</Name><PI>Mario De Bono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elucidating how neural circuits coordinate behaviour, and how molecules underpin the properties of individual neurons are major goals of neuroscience.  Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.  We expect to identify novel conserved molecular and circuitry mechanisms.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,439,996</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACTINONSRF"><Rcn>100618</Rcn><Nid>9372</Nid><HI>The Francis Crick Institute Limited, United Kingdom</HI><Name>MAL: an actin-regulated SRF transcriptional coactivator</Name><PI>Richard Treisman</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>MAL: an actin-regulated SRF transcriptional coactivator

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. The mechanism by which actin represses transcriptional activation by MAL in the nucleus, and its relation to MAL phosphorylation, will be elucidated. Finally, we will map MRTF and TCF cofactor recruitment to SRF targets on a genome-wide scale, and identify the steps in transcription controlled by actin-MAL interaction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,889,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADOS"><Rcn>192374</Rcn><Nid>13442</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>AMPA Receptor Dynamic Organization and Synaptic transmission in health and disease</Name><PI>Daniel Georges Gustave Choquet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPAR) play key roles in information processing by the brain as they mediate nearly all fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Their spatio-temporal organization in the post synapse with respect to presynaptic glutamate release sites is a key determinant in synaptic transmission. The activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR organization is at the heart of synaptic plasticity processes underlying learning and memory. Dysfunction of synaptic transmission - hence AMPAR organization - is likely at the origin of a number of brain diseases.
Building on discoveries made during my past ERC grant, our new ground-breaking objective is to uncover the mechanisms that link synaptic transmission with the dynamic organization of AMPAR and associated proteins. For this aim, we have assembled a team of neurobiologists, computer scientists and chemists with a track record of collaboration. We will combine physiology, cellular and molecular neurobiology with development of novel quantitative imaging and biomolecular tools to probe the molecular dynamics that regulate synaptic transmission.
Live high content 3D SuperResolution Light Imaging (SRLI) combined with electron microscopy will allow unprecedented visualization of AMPAR organization in synapses at the scale of individual subunits up to the level of intact tissue. Simultaneous SRLI and electrophysiology will elucidate the intricate relations between dynamic AMPAR organization, trafficking and synaptic transmission. Novel peptide- and small protein-based probes used as protein-protein interaction reporters and modulators will be developed to image and directly interfere with synapse organization.
We will identify new processes that are fundamental to activity dependent modifications of synaptic transmission. We will apply the above findings to understand the causes of early cognitive deficits in models of neurodegenerative disorders and open new avenues of research for innovative therapies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,157</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADREEM"><Rcn>192351</Rcn><Nid>13449</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adding Another Dimension &#8211; Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials</Name><PI>Mark Bradley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application.
