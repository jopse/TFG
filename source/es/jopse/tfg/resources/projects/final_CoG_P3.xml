A British Academy pilot project conceived by the PI produced a now internationally-used database which gathers together this kind of evidence for thousands of surviving 15th-c. printed books. For the first time, this makes it possible to track the circulation of books, their trade routes and later collecting, across Europe and the USA, and throughout the centuries. The objectives of this project are to examine (1) the distribution and trade-routes, national and international, of 15th-c. printed books, along with the identity of the buyers and users (private, institutional, religious, lay, female, male, and by profession) and their reading practices; (2) the books' contemporary market value; (3) the transmission and dissemination of the texts they contain, their survival and their loss (rebalancing potentially skewed scholarship); and (4) the circulation and re-use of the illustrations they contain.

Such thinking creates new challenges for physicists, driven by the groundbreaking nature of the anticipated application. In the case of laser physics, one of these applications is laser wake-field particle acceleration and possible future uses thereof, such as in collider experiments, or for medical applications such as cancer treatment. To accelerate electrons and positrons to TeV-energies, a laser architecture is required that allows for the combination of high efficiency, Petawatt peak powers, and Megawatt average powers. Developing such a laser system would be a challenging task that might take decades of aggressive research, development, and, most important, revolutionary approaches and innovative ideas.
The goal of the ACOPS project is to develop a compact, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective high-average and high-peak power ultra-short pulse laser concept.
The proposed approach to this goal relies on the spatially and temporally separated amplification of ultrashort laser pulses in waveguide structures, followed by coherent combination into a single train of pulses with increased average power and pulse energy. This combination can be realized through the coherent addition of the output beams of spatially separated amplifiers, combined with the pulse stacking of temporally separated pulses in passive enhancement cavities, employing a fast-switching element as cavity dumper.
Therefore, the three main tasks are the development of kW-class high-repetition-rate driving lasers, the investigation of non-steady state pulse enhancement in passive cavities, and the development of a suitable dumping element.
If successful, the proposed concept would undoubtedly provide a tool that would allow researchers to surpass the current limits in high-field physics and accelerator science."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,881,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACUITY"><Rcn>185678</Rcn><Nid>12314</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands</HI><Name>Algorithms for coping with uncertainty and intractability</Name><PI>Nikhil Bansal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The two biggest challenges in solving practical optimization problems are computational intractability, and the presence

Recently, there has been a huge progress in our understanding of intractability, based on spectacular algorithmic and lower bound techniques. For several problems, especially those with only local constraints, we can design optimum
approximation algorithms that are provably the best possible.
However, typical optimization problems usually involve complex global constraints and are much less understood. The situation is even worse for coping with uncertainty. Most of the algorithms are based on ad-hoc techniques and there is no deeper understanding of what makes various problems easy or hard.

This proposal describes several new directions, together with concrete intermediate goals, that will break important new ground in the theory of approximation and online algorithms.

understand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This
quest has two dimensions. The
theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to
problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when
and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different
philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent
years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections
between them.

In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between
algorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way.
On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration
to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other
NP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better.
On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit
lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive
new circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.

This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms
and computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead
to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better
understanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are
fundamental
but notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to
unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of
probabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater
dialogue between the two areas, with an exchange of ideas and techniques
which leads to accelerated progress in both, as well as a deeper understanding
of the nature of efficient computation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,274,496</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ASIBIA"><Rcn>185645</Rcn><Nid>12021</Nid><HI>University Of East Anglia, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Arctic sea ice, biogeochemistry and impacts on the atmosphere: Past, present, future</Name><PI>Roland Von Glasow</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The Arctic Ocean is a vast expanse of sea ice. Most of it is snow covered as are large continental regions for about half of the year. However, Global Change is arguably greatest in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen more than anywhere else in the last few decades. New record lows occurred in snow extent in June 2012 and sea ice extent in September 2012. Many observations show that widespread and sustained change is occurring in the Arctic driving this unique environmental system into a new state. This project focuses on the biogeochemical links between sea ice and snow and the composition and chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest ~10km of the atmosphere). This is an important topic because the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles, which scatter sunlight directly and influence cloud properties, play key roles for our climate. Additionally, changes in the composition of the troposphere also affect the so-called oxidation capacity, the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself from pollutants.
This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model. This will allow a breakthrough in our understanding of the importance of the changes for the composition and oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and climate and will allow us to calculate adjusted Greenhouse Warming Potentials that include these processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,192,911</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AUGURY"><Rcn>185668</Rcn><Nid>12026</Nid><HI>Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, France</HI><Name>Reconstructing Earth&#8217;s mantle convection</Name><PI>Nicolas Coltice</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowledge of the state of the Earth mantle and its temporal evolution is fundamental to a variety of disciplines in Earth Sciences, from the internal dynamics to its many expressions in the geological record (postglacial rebound, sea level change, ore deposit, tectonics or geomagnetic reversals). Mantle convection theory is the centerpiece to unravel the present and past state of the mantle. For the past 40 years considerable efforts have been made to improve the quality of numerical models of mantle convection. However, they are still sparsely used to estimate the convective history of the solid Earth, in comparison to ocean or atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction. The main shortcoming is their inability to successfully produce Earth-like seafloor spreading and continental drift self-consistently. Recent convection models have begun to successfully predict these processes (Coltice et al., Science 336, 335-33, 2012). Such breakthrough opens the opportunity to combine high-level data assimilation methodologies and convection models together with advanced tectonic datasets to retrieve Earth's mantle history. The scope of this project is to produce a new generation of tectonic and convection reconstructions, which are key to improve our understanding and knowledge of the evolution of the solid Earth. The development of sustainable high performance numerical models will set new standards for geodynamic data assimilation. The outcome of the AUGURY project will be a new generation of models crucial to a wide variety of disciplines."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AdOC"><Rcn>185666</Rcn><Nid>10729</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Advance Optical Clocks</Name><PI>Sebastien Andr&#233; Marcel Bize</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The proposed research program has three main objectives. The first and second objectives are to seek extreme precisions in optical atomic spectroscopy and optical clocks, and to use this quest as a mean of exploration in atomic physics. The third objective is to explore new possibilities that stem from extreme precision. These goals will be pursued via three complementary activities: #1: Search for extreme precisions with an Hg optical lattice clock. #2: Explore and exploit the rich Hg system, which is essentially unexplored in the cold and ultra-cold regime. #3: Identify new applications of clocks with extreme precision to Earth science. Clocks can measure directly the gravitational potential via Einstein&#8217;s gravitational redshift, leading to the idea of &#8220;clock-based geodesy&#8221;.
The 2 first activities are experimental and build on an existing setup, where we demonstrated the feasibility of an Hg optical lattice clock. Hg is chosen for its potential to surpass competing systems. We will investigate the unexplored physics of the Hg clock. This includes interactions between Hg atoms, lattice-induced light shifts, and sensitivity to external fields which are specific to the atomic species. Beyond, we will explore the fundamental limits of the optical lattice scheme. We will exploit other remarkable features of Hg associated to the high atomic number and the diversity of stable isotopes. These features enable tests of fundamental physical laws, ultra-precise measurements of isotope shifts, measurement of collisional properties toward evaporative cooling and quantum gases of Hg, investigation of forbidden transitions promising for measuring the nuclear anapole moment of Hg.
The third activity is theoretical and is aimed at initiating collaborations with experts in modelling Earth gravity. With this expertise, we will identify the most promising and realistic approaches for clocks and emerging remote comparison methods to contribute to geodesy, hydrology, oceanography, etc."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,946,432</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIGBAYES"><Rcn>192413</Rcn><Nid>13428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rich, Structured and Efficient Learning of Big Bayesian Models</Name><PI>Yee Whye Teh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>As datasets grow ever larger in scale, complexity and variety, there is an increasing need for powerful machine learning and statistical techniques that are capable of learning from such data. Bayesian nonparametrics is a promising approach to data analysis that is increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics.  Bayesian nonparametric models are highly flexible models with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that can be used to directly parameterise and learn about functions, densities, conditional distributions etc, and  have been successfully applied to regression, survival analysis, language modelling, time series analysis, and visual scene analysis among others.  However, to successfully use Bayesian nonparametric models to analyse the high-dimensional and structured datasets now commonly encountered in the age of Big Data, we will have to overcome a number of challenges.  Namely, we need to develop Bayesian nonparametric models that can learn rich representations from structured data, and we need computational methodologies that can scale effectively to the large and complex models of the future.  We will ground our developments in relevant applications, particularly to natural language processing (learning distributed representations for language modelling and compositional semantics) and genetics (modelling genetic variations arising from population, genealogical and spatial structures).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,918,092</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BLACARAT"><Rcn>111516</Rcn><Nid>10084</Nid><HI>Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Black Carbon in the Atmosphere: Emissions, Aging and Cloud Interactions"</Name><PI>Martin Gysel Beer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Atmospheric aerosol particles have been shown to impact the earth's climate because they scatter and absorb solar radiation (direct effect) and because they can modify the microphysical properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei (indirect effects). Radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols remains poorly quantified, thus leading to considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the earth&#8217;s climate response to the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC), mostly emitted by anthropogenic combustion processes and biomass burning, is an important component of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates show that BC may be the second strongest contributor (after CO2) to global warming. Adverse health effects due to particulate air pollution have also been associated with traffic-related BC particles. These climate and health effects brought BC emission reductions into the political focus of possible mitigation strategies with immediate and multiple benefits for human well-being.

Laboratory experiments aim at the physical and chemical characterisation of BC emissions from diesel engines and biomass burning under controlled conditions. A mobile laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art aerosol sensors will be used to determine the contribution of different BC sources to atmospheric BC loadings, and to investigate the evolution of the relevant BC properties with atmospheric aging during transport from sources to remote areas. The interactions of BC particles with clouds as a function of BC properties will be investigated with in-situ measurements by operating quantitative single particle instruments behind a novel sampling inlet, which makes selective sampling of interstitial, cloud droplet residual or ice crystal residual particles possible. Above experimental studies aim at improving our understanding of BC&#8217;s atmospheric life cycle and will be used in model simulations for quantitatively assessing the atmospheric impacts of BC."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,015</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="15CBOOKTRADE"><Rcn>185561</Rcn><Nid>12345</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The 15th-century Book Trade: An Evidence-based Assessment and Visualization of the Distribution, Sale, and Reception of Books in the Renaissance</Name><PI>Cristina Dondi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The idea that underpins this project is to use the material evidence from thousands of surviving 15th-c. books, as well as unique documentary evidence &#226;&#128;&#148; the unpublished ledger of a Venetian bookseller in the 1480s which records the sale of 25,000 printed books with their prices &#226;&#128;&#148; to address four fundamental questions relating to the introduction of printing in the West which have so far eluded scholarship, partly because of lack of evidence, partly because of the lack of effective tools to deal with existing evidence.

However, Global Change is arguably greatest in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen more than anywhere else in the last few decades. New record lows occurred in snow extent in June 2012 and sea ice extent in September 2012. Many observations show that widespread and sustained change is occurring in the Arctic driving this unique environmental system into a new state. This project focuses on the biogeochemical links between sea ice and snow and the composition and chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest ~10km of the atmosphere). This is an important topic because the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles, which scatter sunlight directly and influence cloud properties, play key roles for our climate. Additionally, changes in the composition of the troposphere also affect the so-called oxidation capacity, the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself from pollutants.
This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model. This will allow a breakthrough in our understanding of the importance of the changes for the composition and oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and climate and will allow us to calculate adjusted Greenhouse Warming Potentials that include these processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,192,911</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AUGURY"><Rcn>185668</Rcn><Nid>12026</Nid><HI>Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, France</HI><Name>Reconstructing Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s mantle convection</Name><PI>Nicolas Coltice</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowledge of the state of the Earth mantle and its temporal evolution is fundamental to a variety of disciplines in Earth Sciences, from the internal dynamics to its many expressions in the geological record (postglacial rebound, sea level change, ore deposit, tectonics or geomagnetic reversals). Mantle convection theory is the centerpiece to unravel the present and past state of the mantle. For the past 40 years considerable efforts have been made to improve the quality of numerical models of mantle convection. However, they are still sparsely used to estimate the convective history of the solid Earth, in comparison to ocean or atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction. The main shortcoming is their inability to successfully produce Earth-like seafloor spreading and continental drift self-consistently. Recent convection models have begun to successfully predict these processes (Coltice et al., Science 336, 335-33, 2012). Such breakthrough opens the opportunity to combine high-level data assimilation methodologies and convection models together with advanced tectonic datasets to retrieve Earth's mantle history. The scope of this project is to produce a new generation of tectonic and convection reconstructions, which are key to improve our understanding and knowledge of the evolution of the solid Earth. The development of sustainable high performance numerical models will set new standards for geodynamic data assimilation.

The first and second objectives are to seek extreme precisions in optical atomic spectroscopy and optical clocks, and to use this quest as a mean of exploration in atomic physics. The third objective is to explore new possibilities that stem from extreme precision. These goals will be pursued via three complementary activities: #1: Search for extreme precisions with an Hg optical lattice clock. #2: Explore and exploit the rich Hg system, which is essentially unexplored in the cold and ultra-cold regime. #3: Identify new applications of clocks with extreme precision to Earth science. Clocks can measure directly the gravitational potential via Einstein&#226;&#128;&#153;s gravitational redshift, leading to the idea of &#226;&#128;&#156;clock-based geodesy&#226;&#128;&#157;.
The 2 first activities are experimental and build on an existing setup, where we demonstrated the feasibility of an Hg optical lattice clock. Hg is chosen for its potential to surpass competing systems. We will investigate the unexplored physics of the Hg clock. This includes interactions between Hg atoms, lattice-induced light shifts, and sensitivity to external fields which are specific to the atomic species. Beyond, we will explore the fundamental limits of the optical lattice scheme. We will exploit other remarkable features of Hg associated to the high atomic number and the diversity of stable isotopes. These features enable tests of fundamental physical laws, ultra-precise measurements of isotope shifts, measurement of collisional properties toward evaporative cooling and quantum gases of Hg, investigation of forbidden transitions promising for measuring the nuclear anapole moment of Hg.
The third activity is theoretical and is aimed at initiating collaborations with experts in modelling Earth gravity. With this expertise, we will identify the most promising and realistic approaches for clocks and emerging remote comparison methods to contribute to geodesy, hydrology, oceanography, etc."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,946,432</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIGBAYES"><Rcn>192413</Rcn><Nid>13428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rich, Structured and Efficient Learning of Big Bayesian Models</Name><PI>Yee Whye Teh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>As datasets grow ever larger in scale, complexity and variety, there is an increasing need for powerful machine learning and statistical techniques that are capable of learning from such data. Bayesian nonparametrics is a promising approach to data analysis that is increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics.  Bayesian nonparametric models are highly flexible models with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that can be used to directly parameterise and learn about functions, densities, conditional distributions etc, and  have been successfully applied to regression, survival analysis, language modelling, time series analysis, and visual scene analysis among others.  However, to successfully use Bayesian nonparametric models to analyse the high-dimensional and structured datasets now commonly encountered in the age of Big Data, we will have to overcome a number of challenges.  Namely, we need to develop Bayesian nonparametric models that can learn rich representations from structured data, and we need computational methodologies that can scale effectively to the large and complex models of the future.

Radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols remains poorly quantified, thus leading to considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s climate response to the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC), mostly emitted by anthropogenic combustion processes and biomass burning, is an important component of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates show that BC may be the second strongest contributor (after CO2) to global warming. Adverse health effects due to particulate air pollution have also been associated with traffic-related BC particles. These climate and health effects brought BC emission reductions into the political focus of possible mitigation strategies with immediate and multiple benefits for human well-being.

Laboratory experiments aim at the physical and chemical characterisation of BC emissions from diesel engines and biomass burning under controlled conditions. A mobile laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art aerosol sensors will be used to determine the contribution of different BC sources to atmospheric BC loadings, and to investigate the evolution of the relevant BC properties with atmospheric aging during transport from sources to remote areas. The interactions of BC particles with clouds as a function of BC properties will be investigated with in-situ measurements by operating quantitative single particle instruments behind a novel sampling inlet, which makes selective sampling of interstitial, cloud droplet residual or ice crystal residual particles possible.

MBHs also powered quasars known to exist just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Owing to observational breakthroughs and remarkable advancements in theoretical models, we do now that MBHs are out there and evolved with their hosts, but we do not know how they got there nor how, and when, the connection between MBHs and hosts was established.
To have a full view of MBH formation and growth we have to look at the global process where galaxies form, as determined by the large-scale structure, on Mpc scales. On the other hand, the region where MBHs dominate the dynamics of gas and stars, and accretion occurs, is merely pc-scale. To study the formation of MBHs and their fuelling we must bridge from Mpc to pc scale in order to follow how galaxies influence MBHs and how in turn MBHs influence galaxies.
BLACK aims to connect the cosmic context to the nuclear region where MBHs reside, and to study MBH formation, feeding and feedback on their hosts through a multi-scale approach following the thread of MBHs from cosmological, to galactic, to nuclear scales. Analytical work guides and tests numerical simulations, allowing us to probe a wide dynamical range.

It plays a major role in the associated mechanisms leading to disease (stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, &#226;&#128;&#166;). In the last decade, cutting edge technologies, including two-photon scanning laser microscopy (TPSLM) and optical manipulation of blood flow, have produced huge amounts of anatomic and functional experimental data in normal and Alzheimer Disease (AD) mice. These require accurate, highly quantitative, physiologically informed modeling and analysis for any coherent understanding and for translating results between species.
In this context, our first aim is to develop a general methodological framework for physiologically informed microvascular fluid dynamics modeling, understood in a broad meaning, i.e. blood flow, molecule transport and resulting functional imaging signals or signal surrogates.
Our second aim is to validate this methodological framework by direct comparison of in vivo anatomical and functional TPSLM measurements with the simulation results based on the same anatomical data.
The third objective is to exploit these methodologies in order to identify the logic of the structure/function relationships of brain microcirculation and neurovascular coupling, in human health and disease, with a focus on the role of vascular factors in AD.
Specific hypotheses on how vascular changes in AD affect both vascular function and neurovascular coupling can be experimentally tested in animal models of AD. Crucially, similar anatomical (but not functional) data can be acquired in healthy and AD humans. This will enable us to model how AD-induced vascular alterations could affect human patients. Ultimately, it provides us with new avenues for design and/or evaluation of improved diagnosis/preventive/treatment strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,873</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BubbleBoost"><Rcn>185557</Rcn><Nid>12004</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Microfluidic bubbles for novel applications: acoustic laser and ultrasonically controlled swimming microrobots</Name><PI>Philippe, Guy, Marie Marmottant</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Microfluidic techniques developed since the year 2000 have now matured to provide a unique tool to produce large amounts of microbubbles that are not only finely tuned in size, but that can also be embedded in tiny microfabricated structures.

In the present proposal, we plan to take advantage of these novel microfabrication techniques to develop two innovative acoustic applications. These applications, which were out of reach without current techniques, are based on the use of microbubbles with a huge acoustic resonance. The project is structured in two parts that only differ in the way bubbles are embedded in microfluidic environments:

1) Arrays of bubbles: Acoustic Laser
This first part is the development of an acoustic laser, based on microbubbles trapped in a microfluidic circuit. To obtain the conditions for an acoustic laser, arrays of microbubbles will be designed so that they bubbles pulsate in phase, reemitting their energy coherently. The applications are novel systems for high ultrasonic emission power, or meta-materials that store vibration energy.

2) Mobile &#226;&#128;&#156;armoured&#226;&#128;&#157; bubbles:  swimming micro-robots remotely powered by ultrasound
The second part is the conception of ultrasonically activated microswimming devices, with microbubbles embedded within freely moving objects. Their application is to behave as carriers, such as drug carriers, activated at a distance, or to be active tracers that enhance mixing. Microswimmers are mechanical analogues to RFID devices (where electromagnetic vibration is converted into current), here sound is converted into motion at small scales.

Both parts include the same three complementary steps: step 1 is the 3D microfabrication of the geometry where bubbles are embedded, step 2 is their ultrasonic activation, and then step 3 is the optimisation of their resonance by a study of individual resonators.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,856,542</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAUSALPATH"><Rcn>191274</Rcn><Nid>10579</Nid><HI>Panepistimio Kritis, Greece</HI><Name>Next Generation Causal Analysis: Inspired by the Induction of Biological Pathways from Cytometry Data</Name><PI>Ioannis Tsamardinos</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Discovering the causal mechanisms of a complex system of interacting components is necessary in order to control it. Computational Causal Discovery (CD) is a field that offers the potential to discover causal relations under certain conditions from observational data alone or with a limited number of interventions/manipulations.

An important, challenging biological problem that may take decades of experimental work is the induction of biological cellular pathways; pathways are informal causal models indispensable in biological research and drug design. Recent exciting advances in flow/mass cytometry biotechnology allow the generation of large-sample datasets containing measurements on single cells, thus setting the problem of pathway learning suitable for CD methods.
CAUSALPATH builds upon and further advances recent breakthrough developments in CD methods to enable the induction of biological pathways from cytometry and other omics data. As a testbed problem we focus on the differentiation of human T-cells; these are involved in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer and thus, are targets of new drug development for a range of chronic diseases. The biological problem acts as our campus for general novel formalisms, practical algorithms, and useful tools development, pointing to fundamental CD problems: presence of feedback cycles, presence of latent confounding variables, CD from time-course data, Integrative Causal Analysis (INCA) of heterogeneous datasets and others.

Three features complement CAUSALPATH&#226;&#128;&#153;s approach: (A) methods development will co-evolve with biological wet-lab experiments periodically testing the algorithmic postulates, (B) Open-source tools will be developed for the non-expert, and (C) Commercial exploitation of the results will be sought out.

Deviations from this can be called
macroscopic quantum behavior. These phenomena have been experimentally verified with cavity Quantum
Electro Dynamics (QED), trapped ions, and superconducting Josephson junction systems. Recently, evidence
was obtained that also moving objects can display such behavior. These objects are micromechanical
resonators (MR), which can measure tens of microns in size and are hence quite macroscopic. The degree of
freedom is their vibrations: phonons.

I propose experimental research in order to push quantum mechanics closer to the classical world than ever
before. I will try find quantum behavior in the most classical objects, that is, slowly moving bodies. I will use
MR's, accessed via electrical resonators. Part of it will be in analogy to the previously studied macroscopic
systems, but with photons replaced by phonons. The experiments are done in a cryogenic temperature mostly
in dilution refrigerator. The work will open up new perspectives on how nature works, and can have
technological implications.

The first basic setup is the coupling of MR to microwave cavity resonators. This is a direct analogy to
optomechanics, and can be called circuit optomechanics. The goals will be phonon state transfer via a cavity
bus, construction of squeezed states and of phonon-cavity entanglement. The second setup is to boost the
optomechanical coupling with a Josephson junction system, and reach the single-phonon strong-coupling for
the first time. The third setup is the coupling of MR to a Josephson junction artificial atom. Here we will
access the MR same way as the motion of a trapped ions is coupled to their internal transitions. In this setup,
I am proposing to construct exotic quantum states of motion, and finally entangle and transfer phonons over
mm-distance via cavity-coupled qubits. I believe within the project it is possible to perform rudimentary Bell
measurement with phonons."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,004,283</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHRONOS"><Rcn>185535</Rcn><Nid>11965</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Perugia, Italy</HI><Name>A geochemical clock to measure timescales of volcanic eruptions</Name><PI>Diego Perugini</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The eruption of volcanoes appears one of the most unpredictable phenomena on Earth. Yet the situation is rapidly changing. Quantification of the eruptive record constrains what is possible in a given volcanic system. Timing is the hardest part to quantify.
The main process triggering an eruption is the refilling of a sub-volcanic magma chamber by a new magma coming from depth. This process results in magma mixing and provokes a time-dependent diffusion of chemical elements. Understanding the time elapsed from mixing to eruption is fundamental to discerning pre-eruptive behaviour of volcanoes to mitigate the huge impact of volcanic eruptions on society and the environment.
The CHRONOS project proposes a new method that will cut the Gordian knot of the presently intractable problem of volcanic eruption timing using a surgical approach integrating textural, geochemical and experimental data on magma mixing. I will use the compositional heterogeneity frozen in time in the rocks the same way a broken clock at a crime scene is used to determine the time of the incident. CHRONOS will aim to:
1) be the first study to reproduce magma mixing, by performing unique experiments constrained by natural data and using natural melts, under controlled rheological and fluid-dynamics conditions;
2) obtain unprecedented high-quality data on the time dependence of chemical exchanges during magma mixing;
3) derive empirical relationships linking the extent of chemical exchanges and the mixing timescales;
4) determine timescales of volcanic eruptions combining natural and experimental data.
CHRONOS will open a new window on the physico-chemical processes occurring in the days preceding volcanic eruptions providing unprecedented information to build the first inventory of eruption timescales for planet Earth. If these timescales can be linked with geophysical signals occurring prior to eruptions, this inventory will have an immense value, enabling precise prediction of volcanic eruptions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,993,813</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CIRQUSS"><Rcn>111475</Rcn><Nid>11831</Nid><HI>Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, France</HI><Name>Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics with Single Electronic and Nuclear Spins</Name><PI>Patrice Emmanuel Bertet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Electronic spins are usually detected by their interaction with electromagnetic fields at microwave frequencies. Since this interaction is very weak, only large ensembles of spins can be detected. In circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) on the other hand, artificial superconducting atoms are made to interact strongly with microwave fields at the single photon level, and quantum-limited detection of few-photon microwave signals has been developed.

The goal of this project is to apply the concepts and techniques of cQED to the detection and manipulation of electronic and nuclear spins, in order to reach a novel regime in which a single electronic spin strongly interacts with single microwave photons. This will lead to

1)	A considerable enhancement of the sensitivity of spin detection by microwave methods. We plan to detect resonantly single electronic spins in a few milliseconds. This could enable A) to perform electron spin resonance spectroscopy on few-molecule samples B) to measure the magnetization of various nano-objects at millikelvin temperatures, using the spin as a magnetic sensor with nanoscale resolution.

2)	Applications in quantum information science. Strong interaction with microwave fields at the quantum level will enable the generation of entangled states of distant individual electronic and nuclear spins, using superconducting qubits, resonators and microwave photons, as &#226;&#128;&#156;quantum data buses&#226;&#128;&#157; mediating the entanglement.

and finally, the control of the heat exchanged between electrons and photons by coherently tuning the coupling with the electromagnetic environment.

Compared with other resources such as bio-fuel, solar cells, fuel cells or lead acid batteries, rechargeable batteries are more portable and allow for quick energy storage and release. The higher power and energy density make batteries suitable as the energy resource for most portable elect. devices including future vehicles. Among the rechargeable batteries, LIBs have the most potential because of their quick charging rate and high power and energy density. However, ageing of LIBs and the related capacity and power fade is a major concern. For the improvement and future development of batteries, computational modeling and design is an important complementary part to experimental testing which is expensive, time-consuming and sometimes unfeasible.

In this project, the PI proposes to develop, implement, verify and validate a computational multifield and multiscale framework to support the design and optimization of new batteries. The computational framework will support the design and optimization of new anode, separator and cathode materials as well as their structure inside the battery. The measurable outcome of this research will be an open-source software package that can be used to support the design and optimization of LIBs.

Within the computational framework, different (mechanical-thermal-electro-chemical) fields will be linked over multiple scales: from fundamental physics to the design of new battery materials. We will quantify uncertainties in order to provide upper and lower bounds of our predictions and use graph-theory, error-estimation and adaptivity to choose the appropriate model and discretization. The computational framework will be verified and validated by comparison to experiments. Finally, multi-objective optimization over multiple scales will provide a new battery prototype that will be manufactured, tested and compared to the computational predictions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,975,071</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COMOTION"><Rcn>191795</Rcn><Nid>10743</Nid><HI>Stiftung Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron Desy, Germany</HI><Name>Controlling the Motion of Complex Molecules and Particles</Name><PI>Jochen K&#195;&#188;pper</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The main objective of COMOTION is to enable novel experiments for the investigation of the intrinsic properties of large molecules, including biological samples like proteins, viruses, and small cells
-X-ray free-electron lasers have enabled the observation of near-atomic-resolution structures in diffraction- before-destruction experiments, for instance, of isolated mimiviruses and of proteins from microscopic crystals. The goal to record molecular movies with spatial and temporal atomic-resolution (femtoseconds and picometers) of individual molecules is near.
-The investigation of ultrafast, sub-femtosecond electron dynamics in small molecules is providing first results. Its extension to large molecules promises the unraveling of charge migration and energy transport in complex (bio)molecules.
-Matter-wave experiments of large molecules, with currently up to some hundred atoms, are testing the limits of quantum mechanics, particle-wave duality, and coherence. These metrology experiments also allow the precise measurement of molecular properties.
The principal obstacle for these and similar experiments in molecular sciences is the controlled production of samples of identical molecules in the gas phase. We will develop novel concepts and technologies for the manipulation of complex molecules, ranging from amino acids to proteins, viruses, nano-objects, and small cells: We will implement new methods to inject complex molecules into vacuum, to rapidly cool them, and to manipulate the motion of these cold gas-phase samples using combinations of external electric and electromagnetic fields. These external-field handles enable the spatial separation of molecules according to size, shape, and isomer.
The generated controlled samples are ideally suited for the envisioned precision experiments. We will exploit them to record atomic-resolution molecular movies using the European XFEL, as well as to investigate the limits of quantum mechanics using matter-wave interferometry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,982,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORPHO"><Rcn>185623</Rcn><Nid>12014</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; Paris Diderot-Paris 7, France</HI><Name>Theory of strongly correlated photonic systems</Name><PI>Cristiano Ciuti</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The physics of complex quantum systems with controllable interactions is emerging as a fundamental topic for a broad community, providing an opportunity to test theories of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems and opening interesting applications such as quantum simulators. Recently, in solid-state structures with effective photon-photon interactions the rich physics of quantum fluids of light has been explored, albeit not yet in the regime of strong photonic correlations. Exciting advances in cavity Quantum Electro-Dynamics (QED) and superconducting circuit QED make strong photon-photon interactions now accessible. A growing interest is focusing on lattices of coupled resonators, implementing Hubbard-like Hamiltonians for photons injected by pump driving fields. Similarly to electronic systems, the physics of large two-dimensional (2D) photonic lattices is a fundamental theoretical challenge in the regime of strong correlations. CORPHO has the ambition to develop novel scalable theoretical methods for 2D lattices of cavities, including spatially inhomogeneous driving and dissipation. The proposed methods are based on a hybrid strategy combining cluster mean-field theory and Wave Function Monte Carlo on a physical &#226;&#128;&#152;Corner&#226;&#128;&#153; of the Hilbert space in order to calculate the steady-state density matrix and the properties of the non-equilibrium phases.

The concerted behavior of the electrons in these ``correlated materials"" moreover leads to an extreme sensitivity to external stimuli such as changes in temperature, pressure, or external fields. This tuneability of even fundamental properties is both a harbinger for technological applications and a challenge to currently available theoretical methods: Indeed, these properties are the result of strong electron-electron interactions and subtle quantum correlations, and cannot be understood without a proper description of excited states.
The aim of the present project is to elaborate, implement and test new approaches to investigate the spectral and optical properties of correlated materials ``from first principles"", that is, without adjustable parameters. I will build on the success of state-of-the-art dynamical mean field-based electronic structure techniques, but aim at developing them into truly first-principles methods, where a full treatment of the long-range Coulomb interactions replaces the current practice of purely local Hubbard interaction parameters. My target materials are among the most interesting for modern technologies, such as transition metal oxides (with potential applications ranging from oxide electronics to battery materials) and rare earth compounds used as environmentally-responsible pigments.

Instead of massive magnetic kickers, bent thin crystals trapping particles within the crystal lattice planes are used. This type of beam manipulation opens new fields of investigation of fundamental interactions between particles and of coherent interactions between particles and matter. An experiment in connection to Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays study in Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s high atmosphere can be conducted.
Several TeV energy protons or ions are deflected towards a chosen target by the bent lattice planes only when the lattice planes are parallel to the incoming particles direction.
The three key ingredients of CRYSBEAM are:
- a goniometer based on piezoelectric devices that orients a bent finely-polished low-miscut silicon crystal with a high resolution and repeatability, monitoring its position with synthetic diamond sensors. Novel procedures in crystal manufacturing &amp; testing and cutting-edge mechanical solutions for motion technology in vacuum are developed;
- a silica screen that measures the deflected particles via Cherenkov radiation  emission in micrometric optical waveguides. These are obtained with an ultra-short laser micro-machining technique as for photonic devices used in quantum optics and quantum computing. The screen is a direct beam-imaging detector for a high radiation dose environment;
- a smart absorber, which simulates the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s atmosphere, where particles are smashed and secondary showers are initiated. This sets the path to measure hadronic cross sections at an energy relevant for cosmic rays investigation.
The R&amp;D for the various components of such a system are carried out within this project and direct tests at CERN Super Proton Synchrotron to be performed prior to the final installation in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN are proposed.

Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) allow us to see 98% of the way to the big bang, back to a time when the Universe was only a few hundred thousand years old. Other forthcoming data will probe the more local universe in great detail. To test different possible universe models we need accurate theoretical predictions for this data in each model, and new sampling methods to solve the inference problem.

CMB data is most powerful if combined with information from other sources, allowing us to test many possible models of the universes and constrain cosmological parameters. As more models and parameters can be constrained, and higher precision means that more small uncertain corrections need to be consistently modelled, the problem of inference becomes challenging. I propose to develop ground-breaking new sampling methods for testing models with many parameters. To do this I will find novel sampling techniques, make efficient use of qualitatively different properties of different parameters, and develop a new parallelized sampling code that can be run on-demand in the cloud, leveraging the power of potentially vast and cheap cloud computing facilities and freeing up dedicated supercomputers for the problems where they are really needed.

In addition my team will develop new accurate theoretical predictions for confrontation with data, including analysis of new non-linear processes that will be a major source of confusion for dark energy and early universe studies, as well as correlations between different data sets.

I am applying for 70% of my time and two ERC postdocs to tackle these challenges.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,372,496</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Critical"><Rcn>191993</Rcn><Nid>10717</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Behaviour near criticality</Name><PI>Martin Hairer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"One of the main challenges of modern mathematical physics is to understand the behaviour of systems at or near criticality. In a number of cases, one can argue heuristically that this behaviour should be described by a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation. Some examples of systems of interest are models of phase coexistence near the critical temperature, one-dimensional interface growth models, and models of absorption of a diffusing particle by random impurities. Unfortunately, the equations arising in all of these contexts are mathematically ill-posed. This is to the extent that they defeat not only ""standard"" stochastic PDE techniques (as developed by Da Prato / Zabczyk / R&#195;&#182;ckner / Walsh / Krylov / etc), but also more recent approaches based on Wick renormalisation of nonlinearities (Da Prato / Debussche / etc).

Over the past year or so, I have been developing a theory of regularity structures that allows to give a rigorous mathematical interpretation to such equations, which therefore allows to build the mathematical objects conjectured to describe the abovementioned systems near criticality. The aim of the proposal is to study the convergence of a variety of concrete microscopic models to these limiting objects. The main fundamental mathematical tools to be developed in this endeavour are a discrete analogue to the theory of regularity structures, as well as a number of nonlinear invariance principles.
If successful, the project will yield unique insight in the large-scale behaviour of a number of physically relevant systems in regimes where both nonlinear effects and random fluctuations compete with equal strength."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,526,234</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIDYMUS"><Rcn>188661</Rcn><Nid>12214</Nid><HI>Stichting Vu, Netherlands</HI><Name>MICROMACHINED OPTOMECHANICAL DEVICES: looking at cells, tissues, and organs... with a gentle touch</Name><PI>Davide Iannuzzi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Every time we grab an object to look at its geometrical details or to feel if it is hard or soft, we are ineluctably confronted with the limits of our senses. Behind its appearances, the object may still hide information that, encrypted in its microscopic features, remains undetected to our macroscopic assessment. In life sciences, those limits are more than just frustrating: they are an obstacle to study and detect life threatening conditions. Many different instruments may overcome those limits, but the vast majority of them rely either on &#226;&#128;&#156;sight&#226;&#128;&#157; (optics) or &#226;&#128;&#156;touch&#226;&#128;&#157; (mechanics) separately.

Inspired by this tantalizing perspective, and supported by a technology that I have brought from blackboard to market, I have now designed a scientific program to breach into the microscopic scale via an unbeaten path. The program develops along three projects addressing the three most relevant scales in life sciences: cells, tissues, and organs. In the first project, I will design and test a new optomechanical probe to investigate how a prolonged mechanical load on a brain cell of a living animal may trigger alterations in its Central Nervous System. With the second project, I will develop an optomechanical tactile instrument that can assess how subsurface tissues deform in response to a mechanical stroke &#226;&#128;&#147; a study that may change the way physicians look at tissue classification. For the third project, I will deliver an acousto-optical gas trace sensors so compact that can penetrate inside the lungs of an adult patient, where it could be used for early detection of pulmonary life threatening diseases.

Understanding the principles that govern how small molecules such as natural metabolites or synthetic drugs modulate the nucleic acid structures is of prime importance for molecular biology and pharmacology. The field however suffers from the lack of suitable experimental tools to monitor all assemblies and structures formed when a small molecule encounters its targets.

The goal of my project is to develop unique mass spectrometry-based approaches to detect, quantify and characterize all these assemblies and structures.

MAP estimation algorithms such as graph cuts have transformed computer vision in the last decade; they are now routinely used and are also utilized in commercial systems.
Topics of this project fall into 3 categories.
Theoretically-oriented: Graph cut techniques come from combinatorial optimization. They can minimize a certain class of functions, namely submodular functions with unary and pairwise terms. Larger classes of functions can be minimized in polynomial time. A complete characterization of such classes has been established. They include k-submodular functions for an integer k _ 1.
I investigate whether such tools from discrete optimization can lead to more efficient inference algorithms for practical problems. I have already found an important application of k-submodular functions for minimizing Potts energy functions that are frequently used in computer vision. The concept of submodularity also recently appeared in the context of the task of computing marginals in graphical models, here discrete optimization tools could be used.
Practically-oriented: Modern techniques such as graph cuts and tree-reweighted message passing give excellent results for some graphical models such as with the Potts energies. However, they fail for more complicated models. I aim to develop new tools for tackling such hard energies. This will include exploring tighter convex relaxations of the problem.
Applications, sequence tagging problems: Recently, we developed new algorithms for inference in pattern-based Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) on a chain. This model can naturally be applied to sequence tagging problems; it generalizes the popular CRF model by giving it more flexibility. I will investigate (i) applications to specific tasks, such as the protein secondary structure prediction, and (ii) ways to extend the model.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,641,585</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DROUGHT-HEAT"><Rcn>185664</Rcn><Nid>12023</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate</Name><PI>Sonia Isabelle Seneviratne</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Land-climate interactions mediated through soil moisture and vegetation play a critical role in the climate system, in particular for the occurrence of extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves. They are, however, poorly constrained in current Earth System Models (ESMs), leading to large uncertainties in climate projections. These uncertainties affect the quality and accuracy of projections of temperature, water availability, and carbon concentrations, as well as that of projected impacts on agriculture, ecosystems, and health.

In the past years, in-situ and remote sensing-based datasets of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and energy and carbon fluxes have become increasingly available, providing untapped potential for reducing associated uncertainties in current climate models. The DROUGHT-HEAT project aims at innovatively exploiting these new information sources in order to 1) derive observations-based diagnostics to quantify and isolate the role of land-climate interactions in past extreme events (""Diagnostic Atlas""), 2) evaluate and improve current ESMs and constrain climate-change projections using the derived diagnostics, and 3) apply the newly gained knowledge to frontier developments in the attribution of climate extremes to land processes and their mitigation through ""land geoengineering"".

The DROUGHT-HEAT project integrates the newest land observational datasets with the latest stream of ESMs. Novel methodologies will be applied to extract functional relationships from the data, and identify key gaps in the ESMs' representation of underlying processes. These will build on physically-based relationships, machine learning tools, and model calibration. In addition, they will encompass the mapping and merging of derived diagnostics in space and time to reduce ""blank spaces"" in the datasets.

Cells sense mechanical cues to guide their migration. As opposed to passive materials, living cells actively respond to the mechanical stimuli of their environment through the transduction of mechanical information into biochemical signaling events. These responses, particularly to rigidity, include differentiation, migration and alterations in cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion and thus occur over a wide range of time and length scales. I propose to address the effect of substrate mechanical properties on cell migration using quantitative in vitro methods based on micro-fabrication and micro-mechanical techniques. My main objectives are to:
1/ Discover specific mechanisms that guide single cells toward stiffer substrates (a process known as durotaxis), investigate the range of stiffness-sensitive responses and determine the molecular mechanisms based on actin dynamics and cell adhesion assembly. 2/ Characterize the emergence of coordinated cell movements and thus how cells move in concert under external mechanical constraints. In addition to cell-substrate interactions, the role of cell-cell junctions is crucial in the transmission of mechanical signals over the cell population. By analyzing tissue dynamics at both mesoscopic and molecular scales, we hope to unravel how epithelial cell sheets mechanically integrate multiple adhesive cues to drive collective cell migration.3/ Elucidate the role of 3D mechanical environments in collective cell migration. In contrast to migration in 2D, cells in 3D must overcome the biophysical resistance of their surrounding milieu. Based on optical and innovative micro-fabrication techniques to modify the stiffness of 3D scaffolds, we will study its influence on cell migration modes and invasion.

Consequently medical implants are tolerated by the body rather than fully integrated; the material is often sealed off from the body in a fibrotic capsule. Most recent research suggests that morphology is a decisive immunomodulatory trigger and may favor a healing-like reaction of the innate immune system, especially of macrophages.

I have pioneered a single-step method to generate non-woven fibrous scaffolds with surface chemistry control that allows specific cell adhesion. Additionally, my laboratory recently established melt electrospinning writing (MEW) that allows automated scaffold production by solvent-free electrostatic drawing with precise morphology control through rational deposition of polymer filaments in micrometer resolution.

For these applications there exist a large variety of well-established cryptographic systems. Right now, we are in the midst of the shift toward ubiquitous computing on resource constrained devices (RCDs): small devices with severe constraints in terms of computing power, code size, and network capacities. RCDs are used virtually everywhere: smart phones, bank cards, electronic ID-cards, medical implants, cars, RFIDs as bar code replacement, etc. Due to their computational constraints, many current cryptographic security solutions are no longer applicable to RCDs. Existing solutions are often &#226;&#128;&#156;ad-hoc&#226;&#128;&#157; and do not come with a formal security treatment.

The central objective of the ERCC project is to initiate an overarching formal treatment of cryptographic solutions for RCDs, particularly focusing on efficiency. The main conceptual novelty is to follow the concept of provable security. We intend to design new cryptographic protocols that have a mathematical proof of security (assuming the hardness of some mathematical problem) and are still competitive with constructions currently used on RCDs. While we certainly cannot hope that all our new provably secure constructions will be superior to existing ad-hoc constructions, recent preliminary research
results give rise to optimism. Concretely, we will base our new protocols on hard problems in ideal and structures lattices and we will study weaker (yet still realistic) security models for RCDs allowing for efficient instantiations."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,874,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ESTYMA"><Rcn>111547</Rcn><Nid>10073</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Excited state quantum dynamics in molecular aggregates: a unified description from biology to devices</Name><PI>Alessandro Troisi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The coherent dynamics of excitons in systems of biological interest and in organic materials can now be studied with advanced experimental techniques, including two dimensional electronic spectroscopy, with time resolution of few femtoseconds. The theory of open quantum systems, that should support the interpretation of these new experiments, has been developed in different contexts over the past 60 years but seems now very inadequate for the problems of current interest.  First of all, the systems under investigation are extremely complex and the most common approach, based on the development of phenomenological models, is often not very informative.  Many different models yield results in agreement with the experiments and there is no systematic way to derive these models or to select the best model among many.  Secondly, the quantum dynamics of excitons is so fast that one cannot assume that the dynamics of environment is much faster than the dynamics of the system, an assumption crucial for most theories.  A remedy to the current limitation is proposed here through the following research objectives.
(1) A general and automatic protocol will be developed to generate simple treatable models of the system from an accurate atomistic description of the same system based on computational chemistry methods.
(2) A professionally-written software will be developed to study the quantum dynamics of model Hamiltonians for excitons in molecular aggregates. This software will incorporate different methodologies and will be designed to be usable also by non-specialists in the theory of quantum open systems (e.g. spectroscopists, computational chemists).
(3) A broad number of problems will be studied with this methodology including (i) exciton dynamics in light harvesting complexes and artificial proteins and (ii) exciton dynamics in molecular aggregates of relevance for organic electronics devices."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,512,873</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ETASECS"><Rcn>185663</Rcn><Nid>12027</Nid><HI>Technion - Israel Institute Of Technology, Israel</HI><Name>Extremely Thin Absorbers for Solar Energy Conversion and Storage</Name><PI>Avner Rothschild</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>ETASECS aims at making a breakthrough in the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for solar-powered water splitting that can be readily integrated with PV cells to provide storage capacity in the form of hydrogen. It builds upon our recent invention for resonant light trapping in ultrathin films of iron oxide (a-Fe2O3), which enables overcoming the deleterious trade-off between light absorption and charge carrier collection efficiency. Although we recently broke the water photo-oxidation record by any a-Fe2O3 photoanode reported to date, the losses are still high and there is plenty of room for further improvements that will lead to a remakable enhancement in the performance of our photoanodes, reaching quantum efficiency level similar to state-of-the-art PV cells. ETASECS aims at reaching this ambitious goal, which is essential for demonstrating the competitiveness of PEC+PV tandem systems for solar energy conversion and storage. Towards this end WP1 will combine theory, modelling and simulations, state-of-the-art experimental methods and advanced diagnostic techniques in order to identify and quantify the different losses in our devices. This work will guide the optimization work in WP2 that will suppress the losses at the photoanode and insure optimal electrical and optical coupling of the PEC and PV cells. We will also explore advanced photon management schemes that will go beyond our current light trapping scheme by combining synergic optical and nanophotonics effects. WP3 will integrate the PEC and PV cells and test their properties and performance. WP4 will disseminate our progress and achievements in professional and public forums. The innovations that will emerge from this frontier research will be further pursued in proof of concept follow up investigations that will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology.

NMR offers an element-specific, atomic-scale probe of the local environment, providing a potentially powerful probe of local structure, disorder and dynamics in solids. However, despite the almost ubiquitous presence of oxygen in inorganic solids, oxygen NMR studies have been relatively scarce in comparison to other nuclei, owing primarily to the low natural abundance of the  NMR-active isotope, 17O (0.037%). Hence, isotopic enrichment is necessary, often at considerable cost and effort. Furthermore, the presence of anisotropic quadrupolar broadening (and the need for complex high-resolution experiments) has also limited the development and application of 17O NMR to date. Here, we propose to develop an internationally-leading research programme to exploit the largely untapped potential of 17O spectroscopy. This wide-ranging programme will involve (i) the exploration of novel synthetic approaches for cost-efficient isotopic enrichment, (ii) the development of new solid-state NMR methodology, specific for 17O, (iii) the application of state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of 17O NMR parameters and (iv) the application of these methods to three different areas of investigation: high-pressure silicate minerals, microporous materials and ceramics for waste encapsulation. The ultimate long-term aim is to change the way in which solid-state chemists characterise materials; so that solid-state NMR (and 17O NMR in particular) is viewed as a necessary and important step in the refinement of a detailed structural model."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,902,188</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXQUISITE"><Rcn>185601</Rcn><Nid>10746</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>External Quantum Control of Photonic Semiconductor Nanostructures</Name><PI>Stephan Erich Reitzenstein</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In this project, we will control photonic nanostructures by external feedback, optical injection and synchronization.

In a) we will advance the concepts of time-delayed coupling in standard semiconductor laser diodes to few photon states, where quantum fluctuations contribute to or even dominate over the usual classical dynamics. Feedback-coupling in microlasers will allow us to explore the limits of a classical description of chaotic laser dynamics via the Lang-Kobayashi rate equations and to develop an advanced model taking cQED- and QD-specific effects into account. This subject will be complemented by the study of optical injection of coherent light and non-classical light into microlasers to influence and study mode-locking, chaos and stimulated emission down to the quantum level. Single photon feedback in b) will be applied to stabilize coherent coupling of light and matter and to act against decoherence which constitutes a major bottleneck for application of semiconductor nanostructures in quantum information technology. In c) the mutual coupling of microlasers will be used to study synchronization of chaotic quantum devices at the single photon limit and to explore the underlying physics of isochronal synchronization.

A better understanding of continental deformation can mitigate these hazards. However, the coupling between climate and tectonic interactions at plate corners is a key unknown and the focus of this study. My recent work, published in international journals including Science and Nature, quantifies mountain building and climate change and provides a baseline for an innovative study of plate corner dynamics.
This proposal challenges the geoscience &#226;&#128;&#152;tectonic aneurysm&#226;&#128;&#153; paradigm that rapid deformation and erosion at plate corners is initiated from the &#226;&#128;&#156;top down&#226;&#128;&#157; by localized precipitation, and erosion. Rather, I hypothesize that these processes are: 1) initiated from the &#226;&#128;&#156;bottom up&#226;&#128;&#157; by the 3D geometry of the subducting plate; and 2) require a threshold rate of both &#226;&#128;&#156;bottom up&#226;&#128;&#157; deformation and surface erosion to initiate a feedback between climate and tectonics.
I propose, for the first time, a holistic modeling and data collection approach that quantifies the temporal and spatial evolution of all aspects of plate corner evolution, including: 3D thermomechanical modeling of plate corner deformation and uplift for different plate geometries; Atmospheric modeling to quantify the climate response to evolving topography, a topic spearheaded by my research group; And surface process modeling to close the loop and couple the atmospheric and mechanical models. Model predictions will be vetted against observed deformation and erosion histories from existing and new cosmogenic isotope and thermochronometer data from end-member locations including the Himalaya, Alaskan, Olympic, and Andean plate corners.

However little is known about those planets we have detected beyond the fact they exist and their location. For a minority, we know their weight, size and orbital parameters. For less than twenty, we have some clues about their atmospheric temperature and composition. How do we progress from here?
We are still far from a hypothetical Hertzsprung&#226;&#128;&#147;Russell diagram for planets and we do not even know whether there ever will be such classification for planets. The planetary parameters mass, radius and temperature alone do not explain the diversity revealed by current observations. The chemical composition of these planets is needed to trace back their formation history and evolution, as was the case for the Solar System.
Pioneering results were obtained through transit spectroscopy with Hubble, Spitzer and ground-based facilities, enabling the detection of ionic, atomic and molecular species and of the planet&#226;&#128;&#153;s thermal structure. With the arrival of improved or dedicated instruments in the coming decade, planetary science will expand beyond the narrow boundaries of our Solar System to encompass our whole Galaxy.
In the next five years, ExoLights will address the following fundamental questions:
&#226;&#128;&#147; Why are exoplanets as they are?
&#226;&#128;&#147; What are the causes for the observed diversity?
&#226;&#128;&#147; Can their formation history be traced back from their current composition and evolution?
New spectroscopic observations of a select sample of exoplanets&#226;&#128;&#153; atmospheres (~ 20 out of the 150 observable today) will be analysed with state-of-the art statistical techniques and interpreted through a comprehensive set of spectral retrieval models, developed by the PI and her team.

Semidefinite programming  surpasses linear programming in terms of expressivity while remaining tractable. This project proposal investigates the modeling power of linear and semidefinite programming, in the context of combinatorial optimization. Within the emerging framework of extended formulations (EFs), I seek a decisive answer to the following question: Which problems can be modeled by a linear or semidefinite program, when the number of constraints and variables are limited? EFs are based on the idea that one should choose the ""right"" variables to model a problem. By extending the set of variables of a problem by a few carefully chosen variables, the number of constraints can in some cases dramatically decrease, making the problem easier to solve. Despite previous high-quality research, the theory of EFs is still on square one. This project proposal aims at (i) transforming our current zero-dimensional state of knowledge to a truly three-dimensional state of knowledge by pushing the boundaries of EFs in three directions (models, types and problems); (ii) using EFs as a lens on complexity by proving strong consequences of important conjectures such as P != NP, and leveraging strong connections to geometry to make progress on the log-rank conjecture.

Often, these data are collected for no specific purpose, or they turn out to be useful for unanticipated purposes: Companies constantly look for new ways to monetize their customer databases; Governments mine various databases to detect tax fraud; Security agencies mine and cross-associate numerous heterogeneous information streams from publicly accessible and classified databases to understand and detect security threats. The objective in such Exploratory Data Mining (EDM) tasks is typically ill-defined, i.e. it is unclear how to formalize how interesting a pattern extracted from the data is. As a result, EDM is often a slow process of trial and error.

During this fellowship we aim to develop the mathematical principles of what makes a pattern interesting in a very subjective sense. Crucial in this endeavour will be research into automatic mechanisms to model and duly consider the prior beliefs and expectations of the user for whom the EDM patterns are intended, thus relieving the users of the complex task to attempt to formalize themselves what makes a pattern interesting to them.

This project will represent a radical change in how EDM research is done. Currently, researchers typically imagine a specific purpose for the patterns, try to formalize interestingness of such patterns given that purpose, and design an algorithm to mine them. However, given the variety of users, this strategy has led to a multitude of algorithms. As a result, users need to be data mining experts to understand which algorithm applies to their situation. To resolve this, we will develop a theoretically solid framework for the design of EDM systems that model the user's beliefs and expectations as much as the data itself, so as to maximize the amount of useful information transmitted to the user. This will ultimately bring the power of EDM within reach of the non-expert."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,549,315</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GALACTICNUCLEUS"><Rcn>191264</Rcn><Nid>11235</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior Deinvestigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>The Fingerprint of a Galactic Nucleus: A Multi-Wavelength, High-Angular Resolution, Near-Infrared Study of the Centre of the Milky Way</Name><PI>Rainer Sch&#195;&#182;del</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Galactic stellar nuclei are very common in all types of galaxies and are marked by the presence of nuclear star clusters, the densest and most massive star clusters in the present-day Universe. Their formation is still an unresolved puzzle. The centre of the Milky Way contains a massive black hole and a stellar nucleus and is orders of magnitude closer than any comparable target. It is the only galactic nucleus and the most extreme astrophysical environment that we can examine on scales of milli-parsecs. It is therefore a crucial laboratory for studying galactic nuclei and their role in the context of galaxy evolution. Yet, suitable data that would allow us to examine the stellar component of the Galactic Centre exist for less than 1% of its projected area. Moreover, the well-explored regions are extraordinary, like the central parsec around the massive black hole, and therefore probably not representative for the overall environment. Fundamental questions on the stellar population, structure and assembly history of the Galactic Centre remain therefore unanswered. This project aims at addressing the open questions by obtaining accurate, high-angular resolution, multi-wavelength near-infrared photometry for an area of several 100 pc^2, a more than ten-fold increase compared to the current state of affairs. The Galactic Centre presents unique observational challenges because of a combination of high extinction and extreme stellar crowding. It is therefore not adequately covered by existing or upcoming imaging surveys. I present a project that is specifically tailored to overcome these observational challenges. In particular, I have developed a key technique to obtain the necessary sensitive, high-angular resolution images with a stable point spread function over large, crowded fields. It works with a range of existing ground-based instruments and will serve to complement existing data to provide a global and detailed picture of the stellar nucleus of the Milky Way.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,547,657</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GCGXC"><Rcn>188653</Rcn><Nid>12231</Nid><HI>The University Court Of The University Of St Andrews, United Kingdom</HI><Name>GenoChemetics: Gene eXpression enabling selective Chemical functionalisation of natural products</Name><PI>Rebecca Jane Miriam Goss</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"We aim to consolidate a trans-disciplinary research programme in which synthetic biology is harnessed to enable synthetic chemistry.

There is an urgent need for the discovery and development of new drugs and in particular new antibiotics. More than 13 million lives worldwide are currently claimed each year due to infectious diseases. Natural products provide an unparalleled starting point for drug discovery, with over 60% of anticancer agents and over 70% of antibiotics entering clinical trials in the last three decades being based on such compounds.  In order to gain a full understanding as to how a drug works and in order to be able to generate compounds with improved biological activity and physicochemical properties the generation of analogues is essential. In recent years pharmaceutical industries have shied away from natural products due to the perceived synthetic intractability of libraries of natural product analogues and the misperception that it is not possible to carry out thorough structure activity relationship (SAR) assessment on such compounds. As a result of largely abandoning natural products, industries&#226;&#128;&#153; drug discovery pipelines are beginning to run dry; this is a particular concern when faced with the need to combat the ever-increasing problem of drug resistance and infectious disease.

Historically such spaces first arose in the study of systems of analytic differential equations. Closely related, and in fact locally homeomorphic, are deformation spaces of locally homogeneous geometric structures. Such deformation spaces often arise as solutions to basic geometric problems, and their global properties provide powerful topological invariants, in particular for three- and four-dimensional manifolds.
Due to the ubiquity of these spaces, methods and viewpoints from various areas of mathematics such as dynamical systems, algebraic geometry, gauge theory, representation theory, partial differential equations, number theory and complex analysis can be combined, and their interplay gives rise to the richness of this subject. In recent year there has also been an increasing interaction with theoretical physics, which has been fruitful for both sides.
In recent years the deformation theory of geometric structures has received revived attention due to new developments, which involve in a deeper way the connections to Lie theory and gauge theory. Unexpectedly, many new examples of deformation spaces of geometric structures appeared. Two such developments are Higher Teichmueller theory and Anosov representations of hyperbolic groups, which generalize classical Teichmueller theory and the theory of quasi-Fuchsian representations to the context of Lie groups of higher rank.
The goal of the proposal is to understand the fine structure and internal geometry of deformation spaces of geometric structures, and to further develop the structure theory of discrete subgroups in higher rank Lie groups. Of particular interest are deformation spaces with appear in the connection with higher Teichmueller theory, because they are expected to be of similar mathematical significance as classical Teichmueller space."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,570,327</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GETEMO"><Rcn>189839</Rcn><Nid>11813</Nid><HI>Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster, Germany</HI><Name>Geometry, Groups and Model Theory</Name><PI>Emmanuel, Fran&#195;&#167;ois, Jean Breuillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Our proposed research lies at the interface of Geometry, Group Theory, Number Theory and Combinatorics. In recent years, striking results were obtained in those disciplines with the help of a surprise newcomer at the border between mathematics and logic: Model Theory. Bringing its unique point of view and its powerful formalism, Model Theory made a resounding entry into several different fields of mathematics. Here shedding new light on a classical phenomenon, there solving a long-standing open problem via a completely new method.

Recent examples of concrete mathematical problems where Model Theory interacted in a fruitful manner abound: the local version of Hilbert's 5th problem by Goldbring and van den Dries, Szemeredi's theorems in combinatorics and graph theory, the Andr&#195;&#169;-Oort conjecture in diophantine geometry (Pila, Wilkie, Zannier), etc. In this vein, and building on Hrushovski's model-theoretic work, Green, Tao and myself recently settled a conjecture of Lindenstrauss pertaining to the structure of approximate groups.

Our plan in this project is to put these methods into further use, to collaborate with model theorists, and to start looking through this prism at a small collection of familiar problems coming from combinatorics, group theory, analysis and spectral geometry of metric spaces, or from arithmetic geometry. Among them: extend our study of approximate groups to the general setting of locally compact groups, obtain uniform estimates on the spectrum of Cayley graphs of large finite groups, prove an analogue for character varieties of the Pink-Zilber conjectures in relation with rigidity theory for discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and clarify the links between uniform spectral gaps and height lower bounds in diophantine geometry with a view towards Lehmer's conjecture.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,284,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GLYCOSURF"><Rcn>185563</Rcn><Nid>12343</Nid><HI>The University Of Birmingham, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Surface-Based Molecular Imprinting for Glycoprotein Recognition</Name><PI>Paula Maria Da Silva Mendes</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"There is now overwhelming evidence that glycosylation changes during the development and progression of various malignancies. Altered glycosylation has been implicated in cancer, immune deficiencies, neurodegenerative diseases, hereditary disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, antibodies are playing a central role in enabling the detection of glycoprotein biomarkers using a variety of immunodiagnostic tests. Nonetheless, antibodies do have their own set of drawbacks that limit the commercialization of antibody sensing technology. They suffer from poor stability, need special handling and require a complicated, costly production procedure. More importantly, they lack specificity because they bind only to a small site on the biomarker and are not able to discriminate, for instance, among different glycosylated proteins.

The main reason for this progress consists in the apparent exact integrability of the models in the planar limit. Integrability is a hidden symmetry which allows to establish very efficient tools for performing calculations. Remarkably, these tools not only conveniently compute observables at very high orders in the coupling constant, both at weak and at strong coupling, but they also make quantitative predictions at finite coupling strength. A similar amount of progress is due to the development of novel on-shell techniques which allow to construct scattering amplitudes at several loop orders. They become especially powerful when combined with the extended symmetries related to integrability.

The aim of the project is to put the recent rapid progress in integrability and scattering amplitudes on a solid foundation. By enhancing the encountered symmetries and applications towards more realistic gauge and gravity theories we hope to obtain new tools for QFT in general as well as new clues for the problem of quantum gravity.

More concretely, we will work out a precise formulation for the algebra underlying integrability. This is a crucial step towards proving integrability in AdS/CFT and to justify and develop efficient methods. Furthermore, we plan to develop applications of integrability away from the planar limit and for non-integrable gauge theories. Finally, we will extend these methods and considerations to gravity models. We will also take a fresh look at alternative models with a view to solving the puzzle of quantum gravity.

We plan to address these important objectives with the common framework of extended symmetries and powerful calculational techniques for scattering amplitudes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,660,804</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HAPDEGMT"><Rcn>111545</Rcn><Nid>10072</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior Deinvestigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>Harmonic Analysis, Partial Differential Equations and Geometric Measure Theory</Name><PI>Jose Maria Martell Berrocal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The origin of Harmonic Analysis goes back to the study of the heat diffusion, modeled by a differential equation, and the claim made by Fourier that every periodic function can be represented as a series of sines and cosines. In this statement we can find the motivation to many of the advances that have been made in this field. Partial Differential Equations model many phenomena from the natural, economic and social sciences. Existence, uniqueness, convergence to the boundary data, regularity of solutions, a priori estimates, etc.,  can be studied for a given PDE.  Often, Harmonic Analysis plays an important role in such problems and, when the scenarios are not very friendly, Harmonic Analysis turns out to be fundamental. Not very friendly scenarios are those where one lacks of smoothness either in the coefficients of the PDE and/or in the domains where the PDE is solved. Some of these problems lead to obtain the boundedness of certain singular integral operators and this drives one to the classical and modern Calder&#195;&#179;n-Zygmund theory, the paradigm of Harmonic Analysis. When studying the behavior of the solutions of the given PDE near the boundary, one needs to understand the geometrical features of the domains and then Geometric Measure Theory jumps into the picture.

This ambitious project lies between the interface of three areas: Harmonic Analysis, PDE and Geometric Measure theory. It seeks  deep results motivated by elliptic  PDE using techniques from Harmonic Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory.This project is built upon results obtained by the applicant in these three areas. Some of them are very recent and have gone significantly beyond the state of the art. The methods to be used have been shown to be very robust and therefore they might be useful towards its applicability in other regimes.

Still important challenges remain. One of the most thrilling is re-inventing the distribution transformer after more than 125 years since its first use in the electrification of a city. In fact, actual distribution transformers can no longer fulfill the requirements of a modern electric grid highly dominated by distributed sources and new sizable loads, like heat pumps and electric vehicles.
This project proposes the invention of a novel &#226;&#128;&#156;Smart Transformer&#226;&#128;&#157; (ST), based on a modular architecture of units made by power electronics converters, that will be able to manage the energy and the information flows among sources and loads in the distribution area with the goal of decoupling it from the rest of the bulk power system. Actual proposals of Smart Transformers cannot compete in terms of cost, efficiency and reliability with traditional transformers.
This project has decided to take this challenge with a paradigm shift in how to approach it and a new set of methodologies. The breakthrough results of this research will be obtained taking the following high-risk high-gain bet: significantly influence the efficiency and the reliability of the Smart Transformer by routing the energy flows among its power converter units. A new understanding of how the energy flows are managed by the modular connection of power converter units will guide the design of new architectures for the ST allowing different routes for the energy. Graph theory will be used to find optimal paths for the energy flows with the goal of maximizing efficiency and reliability. The energy flows will be managed by relying on information coming from the electric distribution system sensors (requirements) and from the power module sensors (constraints).
The holy grail of this research is to provide a new durable heart to the electric distribution system."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,720</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HELENA"><Rcn>191297</Rcn><Nid>10578</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands</HI><Name>Heavy-Element Nanowires</Name><PI>Erik Petrus Antonius Maria Bakkers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Nanowires are a powerful and versatile platform for a broad range of applications. Among all semiconductors, the heavy-elements materials exhibit the highest electron mobilities, strongest spin-orbit coupling and best thermoelectric properties. Nonetheless, heavy-element nanowires have been unexplored. With this proposal we unite the unique advantages of design freedom of nanowires with the special properties of heavy-element semiconductors. We specifically reveal the potential of heavy-element nanowires in the areas of thermoelectrics, and topological insulators. Using our strong track record in this area, we will pioneer the synthesis of this new class of materials and study their intrinsic materials properties. Starting point are nanowires of InSb and PbTe grown using the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. Our aims are 1) to obtain highest-possible electron mobilities for these bottom-up fabricated materials by investigating new materials combinations of different semiconductor classes to effectively passivate the nanowire surface and we will eliminate impurities; 2) to investigate and optimize thermoelectric properties by developing advanced superlattice and core/shell nanowire structures where electronic and phononic transport is decoupled; and 3) to fabricate high-quality planar nanowire networks, which enable four-point electronic transport measurements and allow precisely determining carrier concentration and mobility. Besides the fundamentally interesting materials science, the heavy-element nanowires will have major impact on the fields of renewable energy, new (quasi) particles and quantum information processing.

The LHC was successful in discovering a particle compatible with the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). However expectations to discover New Physics have not been met so far.

In order to establish whether the new resonance is the SM Higgs boson, or not, precise measurements of its properties are mandatory. These require accurate predictions for cross-sections involving the Higgs boson, as well as for SM backgrounds, that need to be subtracted accurately. Furthermore, since so far New Physics has been elusive, it will be even more important to extend the range of these searches as much as possible. This requires a solid control of SM backgrounds.

This project aims at pushing the frontier of precision QCD calculations to reach an unprecedented precision for collider
processes. The project is divided into two main parts.

In the first part the PI will formulate a general procedure to merge different calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) level. This will lead to the construction of an event generator for two-to-one and two-to-two scattering processes at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), including parton shower corrections, essentially upgrading the POWHEG NLO generator to the NNLO level. Depending on the process considered, a significant reduction of the theoretical errors, by a factor 2-4, will be achieved.

The second part focuses on extending the accuracy of resummed predictions for important QCD observables from next-to-leading logarithmic to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level, again achieving a substantial reduction of the theoretical error. The observables considered include, besides event-shapes and jet-rates, also jet-veto predictions in Higgs + 1 or 2 jet events.

Besides the groundbreaking impact on present LHC physics measurements, these results will also be essential to match the high accuracy of measurements at a future linear collider."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,514,798</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HIGEOM"><Rcn>185633</Rcn><Nid>12325</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Pavia, Italy</HI><Name>Highly accurate Isogeometric Method</Name><PI>Giancarlo Sangalli</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are widely used  in science and engineering simulations, often in tight connection with  Computer Aided Design (CAD). The Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of  the most popular technique for the discretization of PDEs. The IsoGeometric Method (IGM), proposed in 2005 by T.J.R. Hughes et al.,  aims at improving the interoperability between CAD and FEMs. This is achieved by adopting the CAD mathematical primitives, i.e. Splines and Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), both for geometry  and unknown fields representation. The IGM has gained an incredible momentum especially in the engineering community. The use of high-degree, highly smooth NURBS is extremely successful and the IGM outperforms the FEM in most academic benchmarks.

However, we are far from having a satisfactory mathematical understanding of the IGM and, even more importantly, from exploiting its full potential. Until now, the IGM theory and practice have been deeply influenced by finite element analysis. For example, the IGM is implemented resorting to a FEM code design,  which is  very inefficient for high-degree and high-smoothness NURBS. This has made possible a fast spreading of the IGM, but also limited it to quadratic or cubic NURBS  in complex simulations.

The use of higher degree IGM for real-world applications asks for new tools allowing for the efficient construction and solution of the linear system, time integration, flexible local mesh refinement,  and so on. These questions need to be approached beyond the FEM framework. This is possible  only on solid mathematical grounds,  on a new theory of splines and NURBS able to comply with the needs of the IGM.

This project will provide the crucial knowledge and will re-design  the IGM to make it a superior, highly accurate and stable methodology, having a significant impact in the field of numerical simulation of PDEs, particularly when accuracy is essential both in geometry and fields representation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>928,188</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HIPS"><Rcn>188662</Rcn><Nid>10640</Nid><HI>Bar Ilan University, Israel</HI><Name>High-Performance Secure Computation with Applications to Privacy and Cloud Security</Name><PI>Yehuda Lindell</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Secure two-party and multiparty computation has long stood at the center of the foundations of theoretical cryptography. However, in the last five years there has been blistering progress on the question of efficient secure computation. We are close to the stage that secure computation can be applied to real-world privacy and security problems. There is thus considerable interest in secure computation solutions from governments, military and security organisations, and industry. However, in order to answer the needs of secure computation in practice, there is still a need to make secure computation protocols much faster.

Until now, research in efficient cryptographic protocols has typically been in two different directions. The first direction, and the major one, is to construct more efficient protocols and prove them secure, where efficiency is measured by the amount of communication sent, the number of heavy cryptographic operations carried out (e.g., exponentiations), and so on. The second direction is to take the state-of-the-art protocols and implement them while optimising the implementation based on systems concerns. This latter direction has proven to improve the efficiency of existing protocols significantly, but is limited since it remains within the constraints of existing cryptographic approaches.

We propose a synergetic approach towards achieving high-performance secure computation. We will design new protocols while combining research from cryptography, algorithms and systems. In this way, issues like load balancing, memory management, cache-awareness, bandwidth bottlenecks, utilisation of parallel computing resources, and more, will be built into the cryptographic protocol and not considered merely as an afterthought. If successful, HIPS will enable the application of the beautiful theory of secure computation to the problems of privacy in the digital era, cloud security and more."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,175</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HeteroIce"><Rcn>185619</Rcn><Nid>10730</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Towards a molecular-level understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation</Name><PI>Angelos Michaelides</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Ice formation is one of the most common phase transitions on Earth. It is relevant to an enormous variety of phenomena such as weathering, cloud formation, airline safety, agriculture, and energy. However, despite having been studied since antiquity, our molecular level understanding of ice formation is largely incomplete. In particular, almost all ice formation in nature is aided by impurities or the surfaces of foreign materials, yet how surfaces act to facilitate ice formation (heterogeneous ice nucleation) is unclear. Given the ubiquity of ice nucleation, this is arguably one of the biggest unsolved problems in the physical sciences.

Experiment provides insight into crystal nucleation and growth, but most nucleation events happen too quickly and involve too few particles to be rationalised purely by experiment. As a result, computer simulations play an important role and I believe we are now on the verge of using simulation to bring about major breakthroughs in understanding ice formation. Specifically, in this project we aim to perform the first full-on attack on heterogeneous ice nucleation so as to elucidate how the physiochemical properties of materials control their ability to nucleate ice. We will focus on nucleation on solid inorganic substrates and our approach will be to couple systematic studies on model systems with in-depth explorations of more realistic (and experimentally realisable) surfaces. We will improve existing computer simulation methods and develop new ones for accurate large- scale simulations of phase transitions in complex heterogeneous environments. In so doing we will help to make simulations of ice nucleation more routine, enabling us to establish what makes a good ice nucleating agent. The results from this multi-disciplinary project will not only shed light on an important everyday process but may also help to improve climate models and develop improved cloud seeding materials, or inhibitor coatings for industrial purposes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,915,083</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HoloQosmos"><Rcn>191232</Rcn><Nid>11904</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Holographic Quantum Cosmology</Name><PI>Thomas Hertog</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The current theory of cosmic inflation is largely based on classical physics. This undermines its predictivity in a world that is fundamentally quantum mechanical. With this project we will develop a novel approach towards a quantum theory of inflation. We will do this by introducing holographic techniques in cosmology. The notion of holography is the most profound conceptual breakthrough that has emerged form fundamental high-energy physics in recent years. It postulates that (quantum) gravitational systems such as the universe as a whole have a precise `holographic&#226;&#128;&#153; description in terms of quantum field theories defined on their boundary. Our aim is to develop a holographic framework for quantum cosmology. We will then apply this to three areas of theoretical cosmology where a quantum approach is of critical importance. First, we will put forward a holographic description of inflation that clarifies its microphysical origin and is rigorously predictive. Using this we will derive the distinct observational signatures of novel, truly holographic models of the early universe where inflation has no description in terms of classical cosmic evolution. Second, we will apply holographic cosmology to improve our understanding of eternal inflation. This is a phase deep into inflation where quantum effects dominate the evolution and affect the universe&#226;&#128;&#153;s global structure. Finally we will work towards generalizing our holographic models of the primordial universe to include the radiation, matter and vacuum eras. The resulting unification of cosmic history in terms of a single holographic boundary theory may lead to intriguing predictions of correlations between early and late time observables, tying together the universe&#226;&#128;&#153;s origin with its ultimate fate. Our project has the potential to revolutionize our perspective on cosmology and to further deepen the fruitful interaction between cosmology and high-energy physics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HydroSync"><Rcn>188656</Rcn><Nid>12212</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Hydrodynamic Synchronisation in Model and Biological Systems</Name><PI>Pietro Cicuta</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Cilia and flagella beating in synchronised patterns give rise to metachronal waves, beautiful examples of emergent behaviour in biology. These collective dynamical states are essential in life, transporting nutrients and clearing pathogens; they arise from the mechanical interaction of individual cilia mediated by the viscous fluid.
Severe pathologies are associated with cilia malfunction in humans. The current analysis of ciliated tissues in the clinic is focused purely on the frequency of beating: this is insufficient to discriminate between different pathologies. Much more information is present in the cilia dynamics video data that is recorded from patients; it is not being extracted because the correct theoretical framework for analysis is not in place.
We will develop our current work on actively driven colloidal systems to selectively test aspects of the biological scenarios, and start a new line of investigation in our lab, with cell culture experiments to validate these findings; we will understand the onset of collective dynamics (new physics), and how cilia waves are robust against fluctuations in cilia beat frequency, spatial arrangement and fluid rheology. New video analysis tools will be developed based on this full understanding of mechanical synchronisation, enabling the collective dynamics to be related back to the behaviour of individual cilia and to the physical properties of the fluid.
The team will be of two Post-docs, responsible for the two parts of the project: model and biological systems. A PhD student will contribute to the biological experiments, which present multiple lines of investigation, and will develop the video-analysis code to obtain the full degree of information from biological experiments.
The new analysis tool that results from this project will be deployed in the clinical setting through an established collaboration; enabling diagnosis of airway disorders represents a broad impact on physiology and clinical practice.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,261,572</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="I-SURF"><Rcn>185555</Rcn><Nid>12347</Nid><HI>Universitat Konstanz, Germany</HI><Name>Inorganic surfactants with multifunctional heads</Name><PI>Sebastian Polarz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Surfactants are molecules of enormous scientific and technological importance, which are widely used as detergents, emulsifiers or for the preparation of diverse nanostructures. Fascinating abilities regarding the formation of self-organized structures, like micelles or liquid crystals, originate from their amphiphilic architecture, which comprises a polar head group linked to a hydrophobic chain. While almost all known surfactants are organic, a new family of surfactants is now emerging, which combine amphiphilic properties with the advanced functionality of transition metal building blocks. The current project aims at the synthesis of unique inorganic surfactants (I-SURFs), which contain multinuclear, charged metal-oxo entities as heads, and their exploration with regard to additional redox, catalytic or magnetic functionalities. A particular challenge is the creation of smart surfactant systems that can be controlled via external stimuli. While thermotropic liquid crystals and their adjustment in electric fields (enabling LCDs) have been studied in depth, very limited research concerns the control of self-assembled amphiphilic structures by use of magnetic fields. It is obvious that exposure to a magnetic field has inherent advantages over electric fields for controlling structures in water. I-SURFs with single-molecule magnets as heads will be thus prepared and studied. Another groundbreaking task is the creation of I-SURFs with additional catalytic activities. Since catalytic heads can be positioned via self-organization, for instance on the surface of micellar aggregates, catalytic relay systems can be assembled with a second catalytic species in proximity to the first. Thus, cooperative effects in catalytic tandem reactions will ultimately be observed. These examples show that frontier research on I-SURFs is of outstanding relevance for supramolecular science and will certainly pave the way toward new technological applications with great benefits to society."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,863,546</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INTENSE"><Rcn>192414</Rcn><Nid>13453</Nid><HI>University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom</HI><Name>INTENSE: INTElligent use of climate models for adaptatioN to non-Stationary climate Extremes</Name><PI>Hayley Jane Fowler</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The research proposed here will use a novel and fully-integrated data-modelling approach to provide a step-change in our understanding of the nature and drivers of global precipitation extremes and change on societally relevant timescales. Extreme precipitation is increasing globally and theoretical considerations suggest this will continue with global warming, but opportunistic datasets indicate that sub-daily precipitation extremes will intensify more than is anticipated. Determining the precise response of precipitation extremes is hampered by coarse climate models which cannot adequately resolve cloud-scale processes and a lack of sub-daily observations. INTENSE will comprehensively analyse the response of precipitation extremes to global warming by constructing the first global sub-daily precipitation dataset, enabling substantial advances in observing current and past changes. Together with other new observational datasets and high-resolution climate modelling, this will quantify the nature and drivers of global precipitation extremes and their response to natural variability and forcing across multiple timescales. Specifically the project will examine the influence of local thermodynamics and large-scale circulation modes on observed precipitation extremes using new statistical methods which recognise the non-stationary nature of precipitation, and use these to identify climate model deficiencies in the representation of precipitation extremes. The recurrence of extreme hydrological events is notoriously hard to predict, yet successful climate adaptation will need reliable information which better quantifies projected changes.

By providing the highest intermolecular interaction energies, ionic interactions have an extreme impact on molecular structures, which are the key to molecular functions. Experimentally determined structures of small contact ion pairs in solution are very rare and sometimes lacking in complete research fields. In addition, despite the amazing progress in theoretical and supramolecular chemistry, the subtle interplay of interactions in small organic ion pairs remains largely unknown. As a result design principles for small organic ion pairs in solution are not available. To solve this general problem there is an urgent and actual need of the synthetic community, because ion-pairing catalysis is the actual hot topic in asymmetric catalysis. There, new catalysts have to be screened with high effort in a black box mode and reviews state that structural and mechanistic studies will be an essential part of the further progress in the field. In previous projects spread over the fields of organometallic, bioorganic, supramolecular and medicinal chemistry as well as transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis, we gained special NMR expertise in the structure elucidation of ion pairs and reaction intermediates as well as the assessment of intermolecular interactions. Now in this project, nearly all of these various techniques and approaches will be combined in a new and so far unprecedented way and complemented by techniques used for protein ligand interactions and extreme low temperature measurements. With this unique combination, NMR approaches will be developed and applied to elucidate the structures of catalytically active ion pairs and their intermediates in solution and to dissect their intermolecular interactions.

We will use isotopic fractionations imparted by metal-silicate equilibration during core formation to obtain new and firm constraints on (i) the physical and chemical processes during formation of the Earth's core; and (ii) on the origin of volatile elements and the volatile accretion history of the Earth. The underlying concept of our  approach is to compare observed mantle-core isotopic fractionations (determined on natural samples) to the experimentally-determined isotope fractionation between liquid metal (core analogue) and liquid silicate (mantle analogue). Since the magnitude of isotope fractionation is strongly temperature-dependent, this comparison will enable us to evaluate core formation temperatures. I propose to use the stable isotope systematics of W, Mo and Cr to assess as to whether core formation temperatures for the Earth, Moon, Mars and asteroids are different, as would be expected if metal segregation in the Earth involved metal-silicate equilibration in a deep magma ocean. If instead all bodies have similar core formation temperatures, then formation of the Earth's core most probably involved some disequilibrium induced by direct core mergers during accretion from differentiated bodies. The second major theme of the proposed research uses Ge and Sb stable isotopes to trace the origins of Earth's volatiles. The combined investigation of Ge and Sb isotope fractionations in natural samples and metal-silicate equilibration experiments will enable us to determine as to whether Ge and Sb, and with them other volatile elements, show an isotope signature resulting from core formation. Identifying such a signature would provide the unequivocal evidence that volatile elements were delivered to the Earth during core formation and not subsequently, after the core had formed."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,940,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InanoMOF"><Rcn>185614</Rcn><Nid>12330</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut Catala De Nanociencia I Nanotecnologia, Spain</HI><Name>Multifunctional micro- and nanostructures assembled from nanoscale metal-organic frameworks and inorganic nanoparticles</Name><PI>Daniel Maspoch Comamala</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In InanoMOF, we aim to develop frontier Supramolecular and Nanochemistry methodologies for the synthesis of a novel class of structures via controlled assembly of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nanoMOFs) and inorganic nanoparticles (INPs). These methods will embody the premise that &#226;&#128;&#156;controlled object-by-object nano-assembly is a ground-breaking approach to explore for producing systems of higher complexity with advanced functions&#226;&#128;&#157;. The resulting hybrid nanoMOF@INPs will marry the unique properties of INPs (magnetism of iron oxide NPs and optics of Au NPs) to the functional porosity of MOFs.

The first part of InanoMOF encompasses the design, synthesis-assembly and characterisation of nanoMOF@INPs - advanced MOF-based sorbents that incorporate the functionality of the INPs used: magnetically controlled movement, in vivo detectability, enhanced biocompatibility and porosity, pollutant removal, or controlled sorption/delivery. The second part of InanoMOF entails studying the physicochemical properties of the synthesised nanoMOF@INPs and ascertaining their utility as drug-delivery/theranostic systems and as magnetic sorbents for pollutant removal. Specifically, we will study their stability in working media and determine their capacities for drug or pollutant sorption/delivery capacities. As proof-of-concept, we will study their toxicity in vitro and in vivo; enhancement of their in vitro therapeutic efficacy; and their capacity to remove pollutants (in real water and gasoline/diesel fuel samples) via magnetic assistance.

In InanoMOF we will endeavour to establish the synthetic bases for controlling the spatial ordering of nanoMOF crystals, whether alone or combined with other nanomaterials (e.g. INPs, graphene, etc.). We are confident that our work will ultimately enable researchers to create MOF-based composites having cooperative and synergistic properties and functions for myriad applications (e.g. heterogeneous catalysis, sensing and separation).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,942,665</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LBCAD"><Rcn>192410</Rcn><Nid>13452</Nid><HI>Univerzita Karlova V Praze, Czech Republic</HI><Name>Lower bounds for combinatorial algorithms and dynamic problems</Name><PI>Michal Koucky</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project aims to establish the time complexity of algorithms for two classes of problems. The first class consists of problems related to Boolean matrix multiplication and matrix multiplication over various semirings. This class contains problems such as computing transitive closure of a graph and determining the minimum distance between all-pairs of nodes in a graph. Known combinatorial algorithms for these problems run in slightly sub-cubic time. By combinatorial algorithms we mean algorithms that do not rely on the fast matrix multiplication over rings. Our goal is to show that the known combinatorial algorithms for these problems are essentially optimal. This requires designing a model of combinatorial algorithms and proving almost cubic lower bounds in it.

The other class of problems that we will focus on contains dynamic data structure problems such as dynamic graph reachability and related problems. Known algorithms for these problems exhibit trade-off between the query time and the update time, where at least one of them is always polynomial. Our goal is to show that indeed any algorithm for these problems must have update time or query time at least polynomial.

The two classes of problems are closely associated with so called 3SUM problem which serves as a benchmark for uncomputability in sub-quadratic time. Our goal is to deepen and extend the known connections between 3SUM, the other two classes and problems like formula satisfiability (SAT)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>900,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LifeInverse"><Rcn>185581</Rcn><Nid>12003</Nid><HI>Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster, Germany</HI><Name>Variational Methods for Dynamic Inverse Problems in the Life Sciences</Name><PI>Martin Burger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project will develop novel techniques for solving inverse problems in life sciences, in particular related to dynamic imaging. Major challenges in this area are efficient four- dimensional image reconstruction under low SNR conditions and further the quantification of image series as obtained from molecular imaging or life microscopy techniques. We will tackle both of them in a rather unified framework as inverse problems for time-dependent (systems of) partial differential equations.
In the solution of these inverse problems we will investigate novel approaches for the following aspects specific to the above-mentioned problems in the life sciences:

1. Solution of inverse problems for PDEs in complex time-varying geometries
2. Development of appropriate variational regularization models for dynamic images, including noise and motion models
3. Improved forward and inverse modelling of cellular and intracellular dynamics leading to novel inverse problems for nonlinear partial differential equations
4. Construction and implementation of efficient iterative solution methods for the arising 4D inverse problems and their variational formulation

All tasks will be driven by concrete applications in biology and medicine and their success will be evaluated in applications to real problems and data. This is based on interdisciplinary work related to electrocardiology and developmental biology.

At the same time, programming distributed systems is notoriously hard. Programmers have to deal with asynchrony and have to cater for partial failures -- the possibility that certain communication(s), processes, or hosts fail while others remain operational. These failures can have drastic consequences such as the missing to react to critical events or inconsistent states respectively. Limitations on existing hardware infrastructure necessitate subtle assumptions on system and failure models though to achieve efficient yet complex algorithmic solutions, whose implementation is prone to delicate defects.


Existing techniques for engineering reliable distributed systems software require much effort (e.g., program annotations in the form of invariants) thus discouraging many developers from their use; other techniques require developers to explicitly run specific tools (e.g., model checkers) which are thus easily left out and still can not achieve complete validation.

LiveSoft investigates static techniques to verify a subset of relevant and failure-prone aspects of distributed software --- interaction between components --- in a way which is lightweight and can be integrated with compilation. Our techniques will be able to sieve out many important defects upfront by pushing software reliability into the software design process. To that end LiveSoft proposes protocol types which leverage experiences with session types yet focus on fault-tolerant distributed systems by emphasizing asynchrony, failure handling and recovery, protocol composition, security, and parameterization. A main challenge is to support different system and failure models including emerging hardware trends such as hardware transactional memory and non-volatile memory rather than hardwiring speicific notions of (a)synchrony and failures.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,320</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MASSLIP"><Rcn>185677</Rcn><Nid>12030</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systems Medical Diagnostics by In-vivo Ambient Mass Spectrometric Profiling of Tissue Lipidome</Name><PI>Zoltan Takats</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The objective of the proposal is the development of ambient mass spectrometric methods for the characterisation of mucosal metabolome and lipidome. While recent advent of ambient MS provided new means for in-situ and imaging analyses and led to the development of real-time, in-vivo MS characterisation of tissues, there are no methods available for minimally invasive testing of mucosal surfaces including the associated microflora. Human mucosa-associated microbiome (with special emphasis on the gastrointestinal microbiota) has been recently demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of localised (cancer, chronic inflammatory disease) and systemic (hypertension, diabetes, obesity) conditions. While the microbiota interacts with the host mostly via production of a variety of metabolites, currently there is no method available for the in-situ metabolic profiling of mucosa. The envisioned methods will presumably fill this gap, by providing a technique for the diagnosis of a wide range of diseases ranging from acute infections through cancer to dysbiotic conditions of the microflora leading to chronic illnesses.
In the current proposal we put forward the development of different ambient ionisation setups utilising Jet Desorption Ionisation, Sonic Spray Ionisation and Rapid Evaporation Ionisation MS covering a broad range of invasiveness. We plan to combine the methods with standard endoscopic tools and develop the concept of &#194;&#180;chemically aware&#194;&#180; or intelligent endoscopic device capable of the unambiguous identification of pathological conditions of the mucosa. Since the metabolic profile-based identification approach requires large authentic datasets, we plan to create both histopathological and bacterial spectral databases with histological and 16SrRNA-based validation. The proposal also comprises the development of novel multivariate statistical analysis workflows and data fusion algorithms allowing rapid and accurate identification using multimodal MS datasets."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,663</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MHETSCALE"><Rcn>185662</Rcn><Nid>11236</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior Deinvestigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>Mixing in Heterogeneous Media Across Spatial and Temporal Scales: From Local Non-Equilibrium to Anomalous Chemical Transport and Dynamic Uncertainty</Name><PI>Marco Dentz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Transport, mixing and reaction of solutes and particles in natural media are of central importance in many fields of science and engineering, ranging from contaminant dispersion in geophysical flows to diffusion in living cells. Transport in these intrinsically heterogeneous media is characterized by early and late solute and particle arrivals, tailed spatial distributions, and scale effects in measured parameters. These behaviors cannot be explained by available models based on Fick&#226;&#128;&#153;s law and are called anomalous despite their ubiquity. The origin of such phenomena lies in heterogeneity-induced mixing processes that lead to fluctuations in chemical concentration, or, in other words, to physical non-equilibrium. Current transport formulations based on the advection-dispersion-reaction equation or phenomenological non-equilibrium models lack the relation to the heterogeneity controls, fail to describe mixing and concentration variability and thus are not suited for the quantification of chemical reactions. The main objective of this proposal is to establish a global predictive framework that quantifies mixing across scales, anomalous transport and reaction, and dynamic uncertainty for heterogeneous media. We propose an integrated approach that links the interrelated phenomena of mixing, anomalous transport and chemical reaction. In short, the idea consists in quantifying microscale heterogeneity-induced mixing in terms of the flow kinematics and heterogeneity structure and linking it to transport through its relation to Lagrangian particle dynamics. These dynamics will be quantified stochastically by a novel generalized continuous time random walk approach and used to model chemical reactions under physical non-equilibrium in order to obtain a new solid approach for simulating reactive and conservative transport through natural media.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,904,186</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MINERVA"><Rcn>185644</Rcn><Nid>12018</Nid><HI>Koc University, Turkey</HI><Name>Communication Theoretical Foundations of Nervous System Towards BIO-inspired Nanonetworks and ICT-inspired Neuro-treatment</Name><PI>Ozgur B.

Emerging nanoscale applications mandate enabling nanomachines to communicate and form nanonetworks to overcome the limitations of a single one. Thus, our aim is to find the answer to the profound question, i.e., &#226;&#128;&#156;is the room down there sufficient for a communication network?&#226;&#128;&#157; Thanks to natural evolution, the affirmative answer is right inside us. Human body is a large- scale communication network of molecular nanonetworks composed of billions of nanomachines, i.e., cells, which use molecules to encode, transmit and receive information. Any communication failure that is beyond the recovery capabilities of this network leads to diseases. In this project, first, (1) we will investigate the communication theoretical foundations of nanoscale neuro-spike communication channels between neurons. Second, (2) we will study multi-terminal, i.e., multiple-access, relay, broadcast, neuro-spike channels and nervous nanonetwork in terms of communication theoretical metrics. Third, (3) we will validate our channel and nanonetwork models with physiological data, and develop a nervous nanonetwork simulator (N4Sim).

Recent work has revealed exciting physics at their interfaces, including two-dimensional (2D) conductivity and superconductivity in the electron gas that forms at the interface between two band insulators, LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. However, to date, no interfacial system has truly shown electronic properties that are absent from the phase diagram of both bulk constituents. I argue that to fully embrace the immense potential of oxide interfaces and unveil unprecedented electronic phases, combining insulators with stronger electronic correlations is mandatory.

At the crossroad between strongly-correlated electron physics, microelectronics and spintronics, the MINT project will pioneer routes toward a new realm of solid-state physics. MINT will harness electronic and magnetic instabilities in correlated oxides to craft new electronic phases controllable by external stimuli. These phases will be generated by the synergic action of strain engineering, interfacial charge/orbital/spin reconstruction and octahedra connectivity control, using rare-earth titanate RTiO3 Mott-Hubbard insulators as templates.

Emerging states that are foreseen include 2D electron gases with ferroic order, superconductivity at relatively high temperature, topological states and new forms of multiferroicity and magnetoelectric coupling. The discovery of any of these new states would represent a major breakthrough in oxide electronics. They will open possibilities for innovative devices yielding giant electroresistance without ferroelectrics, and new schemes to control spin currents by electric fields.

At full term, MINT will establish whether oxide interfaces will live up to their expectations and start in the coming decades a technological revolution comparable to that of silicon."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,026</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOTMELSUM"><Rcn>185607</Rcn><Nid>11993</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Motivic Mellin transforms and exponential sums through non-archimedean geometry</Name><PI>Raf Cluckers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"We aim to create a new and powerful theory of motivic integration which incorporates Mellin transforms. The absence of motivic Mellin transforms is a major drawback of the existing theories. Classical Mellin transforms are in essence Fourier transforms on the multiplicative group of local fields. We aim to apply this theory to study new motivic Poisson summation formulas, new transfer principles, and applications of these. All of this has so far only been studied in the presence of additive characters, and remains completely open for multiplicative characters. Understanding all this at a motivic level yields a uniform understanding when the local field varies and will require an approach using non-archimedean geometry. We will open up possibilities for applications via new transfer principles and will give access to motivic Poisson formulas of other groups than the additive group. For these applications it is important that Fubini Theorems are present at the level of the motivic integrals, which we aim to develop. We will overcome the major obstacle of the totally different nature of the dual group of the multiplicative group by a proposed sequence of germs of ideas by the author. The importance of our work on motivic Fourier transforms on the additive group is already widely recognized, and this proposal will complement it by exploring the new territory of motivic multiplicative characters. A final topic is the study of the highly non-understood exponential sums modulo powers of primes, in relation with Igusa's foundational work. We will try to discover a deeper understanding of the uniform behavior of these sums when the prime number varies. These sums are linked to geometrical concepts like the log-canonical threshold, and also to Poisson summation, after the work by Igusa.

In a classical regime and for a fixed temperature, atoms are described by particles that interact through a force field and evolve according to Newton&#226;&#128;&#153;s equations of motion, with additional stochastic terms to model thermostating. This simulation technique is called molecular dynamics. Applications are ubiquitous, ranging from biology to materials science.

The direct numerical simulation of these models is extremely computationally expensive, since the typical timescale at the microscopic level is orders of magnitude smaller than the macroscopic timescales of interest. Many algorithms used by practitioners have not yet been investigated by applied mathematicians. The aim of this proposal is to further develop the mathematical analysis of these methods and to build new and more efficient algorithms, validated by precise error estimates.

The underlying theoretical questions are related to the mathematical definition and quantification of metastability for stochastic processes. Metastability refers to the fact that the stochastic process remains trapped in some regions of the configuration space for very long times. Using naive simulations, transitions between these states are very rarely observed, whereas these transition events are actually those which matter at the macroscopic level. Metastability is one of the major bottlenecks in making molecular simulations predictive for real life test cases.

The main challenges motivating this proposal are: the design of efficient techniques to sample high-dimensional multimodal measures, the development and analysis of algorithms to sample metastable dynamics and the construction of coarse-graining techniques for high-dimensional problems.

This project relies on strong collaborations with practitioners (biologists and physicists) in order to propose common benchmarks, to identify the methodological bottlenecks and to apply new algorithms to real life test cases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,773,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MULTISCOPE"><Rcn>185556</Rcn><Nid>11381</Nid><HI>Julius-Maximilians Universitaet Wuerzburg, Germany</HI><Name>Multidimensional Ultrafast Time-Interferometric Spectroscopy of Coherent Phenomena in all Environments</Name><PI>Tobias Manuel Brixner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"We propose to develop and apply novel methods of nonlinear spectroscopy to investigate the significance and consequences of coherent effects for a variety of photophysical and photochemical molecular processes. We will use coherent two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy as an ideal tool to study electronic coherences.

Quantum mechanics as described by the Schr&#195;&#182;dinger equation is fully coherent: The phase of a wavefunction evolves deterministically in the time-dependent case.

In contrast to conventional 2D spectroscopy, we will not measure the coherently emitted field within a four-wave mixing process but rather implement a range of incoherent observables (ion mass spectra, fluorescence, and photoelectrons). Yet we can still extract all the desired information using &#226;&#128;&#156;phase cycling&#226;&#128;&#157; with collinear pulse sequences from a femtosecond pulse shaper. This opens up a new range of interdisciplinary experiments and will allow for the first time a direct nonlinear-spectroscopic comparison of molecular systems in all states of matter. Specifically, we will realize 2D spectroscopy in molecular beams, liquids, low-temperature solids, and on surfaces including heterogeneous and nanostructured samples. Tuning the external couplings will help elucidating the role of the environment in electronic (de)coherence phenomena.

Furthermore, we will combine 2D spectroscopy with subdiffraction spatial resolution using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). This enables us to map transport in molecular aggregates and other heterogeneous nanosystems in time and space on a nanometer length scale.

Despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts, the mechanisms of the gas-to-particle conversion are still poorly understood, and so are the parameterizations of this process in climate models. Improving the situation critically depends on the continuous development of experimental techniques. For the quantitative characterization of nanoparticle dynamics especially time resolution deserves more attention. I am thus proposing to design instruments that will improve time resolution by up to five orders of magnitude. Specifically, I am planning the design of a fast-scanning electrical mobility based nanoparticle spectrometer delivering size distributions from 1 nm upwards at 1 Hz, for number concentrations as low as 100 cm-3. Secondly, in a new approach to the study of secondary organic aerosol formation I am planning to apply small angle x-ray scattering providing direct information on particle size and number at sub-millisecond time-resolution.

Current methods for pain management (e.g. local injection of pain killers) are inadequate because of the short duration of action. Even sustained release treatments, such as drug-loaded liposomes, provide only one week of analgesia producing a continuous extended nerve blockade without allowing for changes in daily physical activity or level of pain relief. More importantly, such systems cannot be turned off until they run their course.

In this proposal, a locally-injected or implanted near infrared (NIR)-sensitive drug reservoir that can be triggered by a simple handheld laser device applied externally is described. The device enables drug release with consistent response over multiple on/off cycles. Such a device, implanted (or eventually injected) on a nerve or near the neuraxis, could have substantial clinical impact in the treatment of chronic (or prolonged perioperative) pain.

This system will consist of an impermeable ethylcellulose membrane embedded with temperature-sensitive polymer nanoparticles and NIR-active gold nanoparticles. The membrane will be engineered such that the nanoparticles form a disordered but interconnected network throughout. The gold nanoparticle concentration will be adjusted so that light-induced heating of the nanoparticles produces sufficient heat to collapse the polymer, thus opening the porous network. Those nanostructured materials which compose the device will be produced in a continuous manner by using microfluidic reactors to avoid the characteristic disadvantages when using conventional discontinuous (batch) reactors. Nanoparticle-synthesis protocols will be supported by computational fluid dynamics.

The specific aims will be geared toward engineering a NIR-triggered drug release device and optimizing for a variety of drug types, then demonstrating its biocompatibility and therapeutic effectiveness in vivo."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,570,091</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NANOPRS"><Rcn>111553</Rcn><Nid>11827</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Nano-Particle-Resolved Studies</Name><PI>Christopher Patrick (Paddy) Royall</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Amorphous materials may be classified into three types &#226;&#128;&#147; thermodynamically stable liquids, metastable (supercooled) liquids and solid glasses. The second type represents the meeting point of many of the great challenges of statistical physics and materials science. What is the mechanism of dynamical arrest, by which structural relaxation become progressively inhibited upon cooling from a liquid to a glass? Can we develop physical pictures of the sequence of fluctuations associated with irreversible relaxation in metastable liquids? How do crystals emerge from these fluctuations?

Here we take a structural approach coupled with novel experiments and computer simulations to tackle two specific questions. Firstly, it has long been believed that there should be some structural mechanism underpinning the glass transition, where deeply supercooled liquids continuously transform into solid glasses. Secondly, the fate of the supercooled liquid &#226;&#128;&#147; whether it crystallises on accessible timescales &#226;&#128;&#147; should also be related to the local atomic arrangements in the liquid. Tackling the first will lead to insight into the nature of the glass transition - it is not known whether or not there is a true thermodynamic transition to a glass. As for crystallisation, predicted nucleation rates vary wildly with those obtained experimentally in the only system in which both have been compared, little is known beyond trial and error of means by which crystallisation in mixtures can be controlled. In short, our understanding of the fate of supercooled liquids is lacking in a variety of ways. Understanding the glass transition and nucleation is of fundamental importance, and both have important applications for example in metallic glasses and phase change materials. The former are prized for their superior mechanical properties such as extreme toughness while latter underpin emergent technologies such as optical data storage and phase change memory."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,336,887</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NAUTILUS"><Rcn>185576</Rcn><Nid>12337</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Neutron cAptUres consTraIning steLlar nUcleosynthesiS</Name><PI>Rene Reifarth</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"NAUTILUS will investigate the nucleosynthesis of the chemical elements during the evolution of stars, which is the basis for understanding the chemical history of the Universe. The vast majority of the elements heavier than iron are produced by neutron capture reactions. The precise knowledge of the involved neutron capture cross sections for certain isotopes sets tight limits for stellar parameters and puts strong constraints on the age of the Universe.

Accurate measurements of the key nuclear reactions in the mass region around the radioactive 85Kr will lead to the improvements needed to characterize the production processes of the elements in stars. The respective high-accuracy abundance patterns in single stars can then be interpreted as diagnostic tools for the deep stellar interior and the isobaric 87Sr/87Rb chronometer constraints the history of the Universe.

The neutron capture cross section of radioactive isotopes for neutron energies in the keV region will be measured by a time-of-flight (TOF) experiment. NAUTILUS will provide a unique facility realizing the TOF technique with an ultra-short flight path at the FRANZ setup at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Germany. A highly optimized spherical photon calorimeter will be built and installed at an ultra-short flight path.

NAUTILUS opens new horizons in the area of neutron-induced reaction research, as smallest samples like of 85Kr - which will be produced as an isotopically pure radioactive sample - will become measureable in reasonable times.

Future applications include the study of neutron capture cross sections important for next generation nuclear reactors: For the first time the high neutron fluxes needed to study the mass region of interest in the keV energy range will be available."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,871,596</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NLL"><Rcn>185665</Rcn><Nid>11372</Nid><HI>Bilkent &#195;&#156;niversitesi, Turkey</HI><Name>Nonlinear Laser Lithography</Name><PI>Fatih &#195;&#182;mer &#196;&#176;lday</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Control of matter via light has always fascinated humankind; not surprisingly, laser patterning of materials is as old as the history of the laser. However, this approach has suffered to date from a stubborn lack of long-range order. We have recently discovered a method for regulating self-organised formation of metal-oxide nanostructures at high speed via non-local feedback, thereby achieving unprecedented levels of uniformity over indefinitely large areas by simply scanning the laser beam over the surface.

Here, we propose to develop hitherto unimaginable levels of control over matter through laser light. The total optical field at any point is determined by the incident laser field and scattered light from the surrounding surface, in a mathematical form similar to that of a hologram. Thus, it is only logical to control the self-organised pattern through the laser field using, e.g., a spatial light modulator. A simple wavefront tilt should change the periodicity of the nanostructures, but much more exciting possibilities include creation of patterns without translational symmetry, i.e., quasicrystals, or patterns evolving non-trivially under scanning, akin to cellular automata. Our initial results were obtained in ambient atmosphere, where oxygen is the dominant reactant, forming oxides. We further propose to control the chemistry by using a plasma jet to sputter a chosen reactive species onto the surface, which is activated by the laser. While we will focus on the basic mechanisms with atomic nitrogen as test reactant to generate compounds such as TiN and SiN, in principle, this approach paves the way to synthesis of an endless list of materials.

By bringing these ideas together, the foundations of revolutionary advances, straddling the boundaries of science fiction, can be laid: laser-controlled self-assembly of plethora of 2D patterns, crystals, and quasicrystals alike, eventually assembled layer by layer into the third dimension -- a 3D material synthesiser."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,920</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NMST"><Rcn>188673</Rcn><Nid>11263</Nid><HI>Bcam - Basque Center For Applied Mathematics Asociacion, Spain</HI><Name>New methods and interacions in Singularity Theory and beyond</Name><PI>Javier Jose Fernandez De Bobadilla De Olazabal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project is centred in Singularity Theory and its interactions and applications to Complex and Algebraic Geometry, Differential/symplectic/Contact Topology, Hodge Theory and Algebraic Topology.

The advancement of earthquake risk assessment and forecasting methods (probability estimates that a mainshock may occur in terms of hypocentre location, magnitude and time) calls for a sound physical basis. The nucleation, propagation and arrest of an earthquake rupture results from the interplay of stress perturbations, micro- to macro-scale friction- and rupture-related processes and fault zone geometrical complexity. Most of the information about these parameters is out of reach of seismic waves and geophysical analysis. Here we aim at enhancing our knowledge of earthquake physics (from nucleation to arrest) by means of a multidisciplinary approach that includes:

1) experiments to investigate earthquake nucleation by reproducing crustal (pressure, temperature, presence of fluids, stress perturbations, etc.) deformation conditions with the most powerful earthquake simulator installed worldwide (SHIVA);

2) experiments to investigate rupture propagation on simulated faults using natural rocks and small-scale analogue models;

3) field studies of exhumed seismogenic sources to quantify the geometrical complexity of natural fault zones;

4) advanced numerical simulation techniques that will integrate the above information and allow up-scaling to natural faults. The numerical models will produce physically-based earthquake simulations that will be compared with high-resolution seismic data.

By reproducing crustal deformation conditions (stress, temperature, fluid pressures, etc.) in the laboratory and by monitoring acoustic emissions, gases, electromagnetic waves, etc., produced by the rock samples during deformation, a by-product of our research will be the systematic investigation of precursory phenomena (seismic, chemical, and electromagnetic) associated to earthquake nucleation processes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,963,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NONSPHEREFLOW"><Rcn>185574</Rcn><Nid>12008</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands</HI><Name>Multiscale modelling of gas-fluidized flows of non-spherical particles</Name><PI>Johannes Tiemen Padding</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Many important products are made using fluidized bed reactors, where solid particles are suspended by a gas flow. This promotes highly efficient gas-particle contact, resulting in high heat transfer, high chemical reaction rates and high product yields. Multiscale modelling has proven to be indispensable in the design and optimisation of fluidized bed reactors. Most coarse-grained models assume that the solid particles are of spherical shape because this simplifies the treatment of gas-solid drag and particle collisions. However, many particles used in fluidized bed (bio)reactors are non-spherical. This means that anisotropic collisions, anisotropic gas-solid drag, effects of local particle alignment, and alignment by nearby internal and external walls all need to be taken into account.
I propose to pioneer a multiscale simulation methodology, backed up by validating in-house experiments, for prediction of structure formation in gas-solid flows of inelastic non-spherical particles. As a first step we focus on elongated particles. The multiscale approach consists of: 1) fully resolved simulations to obtain closures for translational and rotational gas drag tensors in crowded environments and near external and internal walls, 2) Discrete Particle Model simulations to validate the drag closures with matching experiments and to obtain statistics of angular and linear velocity changes due to inter-particle collisions between groups of particles, 3) a novel Lagrangian method based on stochastic multi-particle collisions. The collision propagation rules make maximum use of conservation laws and local symmetries of the particle configuration, orientation and deformation rates. The coarse-grained model is amenable to a parcel approach and can be coupled with heat and mass transfer models, allowing for simulation of industrial scale reactors with non-spherical particles.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,983,012</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NSHOCK"><Rcn>185669</Rcn><Nid>10727</Nid><HI>Politecnico Di Milano, Italy</HI><Name>Non classical rarefaction shock-waves in molecularly complex vapours</Name><PI>Alberto Guardone</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The expansion of a dilute gas through a gasdynamics convergent-divergent nozzle can occur in three different regimes, depending on the inlet and discharge conditions and on the gas: via a fully subsonic expansion, via a subsonic-supersonic or via a subsonic-supersonic-subsonic expansion embedding a compression shock wave within the divergent portion of the nozzle. I devised an exact solution procedure for computing nozzle flows of real gases, which allowed me to discover that in molecularly complex fluids eighteen additional different flow configurations are possible, each including multiple compression classical shocks as well as non classical rarefaction ones. Modern thermodynamic models indicate that these exotic regimes can possibly occur in nozzle flows of molecularly complex fluids such as hydrocarbons, siloxanes or perfluorocarbons operating close to the liquid-vapour saturation curve and critical point. The experimental observation of one only of these eighteen flow configurations would be sufficient to prove for the first time that non classical gasdynamics phenomena are indeed possible in the vapour region of a fluid with high molecular complexity
To this purpose, a modification to the blow-down wind tunnel for dense gases at Politecnico di Milano is proposed to use mixtures of siloxane fluids. Measurements are complemented by numerical simulations of the expected flow field and by state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification techniques. The distinctive feature of the proposed experiment is the adoption of mixture of siloxanes as working fluids. Mixtures of siloxanes are well known to exhibit an higher stability limit than their pure components, due to the redistribution process occurring at high temperature.
The increased understanding of real-gas dynamics will enable to improve the design of Organic Rankine Cycle Engines, to be used in  small scale energy production from biomasses, binary geothermal systems and concentrating solar thermal power plants.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,485,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoQuaNt"><Rcn>189836</Rcn><Nid>11814</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Nanofiber Quantum Networks</Name><PI>Arno Rauschenbeutel</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>We propose to establish nanofiber-based atom-light interfaces as quantum-enabled fiber-optical components for quantum information processing and communication (QIPC). The key ingredient of this interface is a nanofiber-based optical dipole trap which stores laser-cooled atoms in the evanescent field surrounding the nanofiber. In this evanescently coupled atom-waveguide-system, even a few hundred atoms are already optically dense for near-resonant photons propagating through the nanofiber. In combination with the proven good coherence properties of nanofiber-trapped atoms, these highly efficient light-matter interfaces are thus perfectly suited for the implementation of practical QIPC devices. More specifically, the first goal of this project is to realize quantum memories which allow one to directly store and retrieve the quantum state of fiber-guided photons. The efficiency of the retrieval process will highly benefit from the fact that conservation of energy and momentum stabilizes the emission of the stored light into the nanofiber-guided mode. Furthermore, nanofiber-coupled atomic ensembles can provide a strong optical non-linearity which, due to the waveguide-geometry, scales with the square root of the length of the sample and can be much larger than for freely propagating light beams. The second goal of this project is to explore and to maximize this non-linearity until it prevails down to the single photon level. This single-photon non-linearity would enable optical quantum switches and photon-photon quantum gates which are essential for implementing deterministic optical quantum computation. The final goal is then to interconnect these components in order to demonstrate three different fiber-optical quantum network applications: highly efficient photon counting using fiber-coupled quantum memories, highly efficient heralded entanglement of two fiber-coupled quantum memories, and a non-linear interaction between two single-photon pulses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,993,526</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoSpin"><Rcn>111549</Rcn><Nid>10071</Nid><HI>Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Nanoscale spin interactions and dynamics on superconducting surfaces</Name><PI>Katharina Jennifer Franke</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The latest concepts for quantum computing and data storage envision the use of single spins, which can be addressed and manipulated reliably. One of the main limitations towards this challenging goal is the ultra-short lifetime of excited spin states due to the interaction with the contacting leads. Another limitation is that coherence between individual spins is quickly lost. Already the measurement process for resolving coherent electron-spin interactions at the single atom level is highly challenging and has not been achieved so far.
Within our proposal, we will construct a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope with a radio-frequency current detection system and a microwave source close to the tip. With this unique machine, we will be able to carry out state-of-the-art STM experiments combined with atomic-scale precision of measuring electron-spin resonance signals. With the approach of measuring in the frequency domain, we increase our energy resolution beyond the thermal energy level broadening into the &#194;&#181;eV range and can thus investigate magnetic coupling, hyperfine interactions and spin coherence properties, which are not accessible in conventional STM experiments. We will also be able to probe the timescales of spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxations by pump-probe excitation schemes.
We will use this machine for resolving magnetic properties of single atoms and atomic-size nanostructures on superconducting substrates. These substrates exhibit two peculiarities, which are of crucial importance for quantum information processing. The spin lifetimes are orders of magnitudes larger than on normal metal surfaces. Furthermore, the long coherence length of Cooper pairs mediates coherent coupling of the spin states of paramagnetic atoms. We will manipulate the spin states by the intrinsic Josephson current as well as with external microwave radiation. Our model systems on superconductors will provide crucial steps towards quantum spin processing.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,469</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoSurfs"><Rcn>111426</Rcn><Nid>10094</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Nanostructured Surfaces: Molecular Functionality on advanced sp2-bonded substrates</Name><PI>Wilhelm Auw&#195;&#164;rter</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Inspired by the diverse functionalities of complex molecular building blocks evidenced in manifold life processes as transport of respiratory gases, metabolism or light harvesting, we aim for a comprehensive characterization and control of molecular properties in surface-based model systems.

We propose to apply nanostructured boron nitride (BN) monolayers and sp2-heterostructures as templates for molecular units and architectures. As indicated by the fascinating nanomesh interface and the electronically corrugated atomically thin BN sheet on Cu we recently reported, inert, temperature stable and insulating BN has a huge potential as advanced substrate supporting molecular functionality, self-ordering and intercalation.
By combining the inherent functionality of organic or bio-molecular building blocks with the unusual electronic and structural characteristics of  advanced sp2-bonded substrates grown by chemical vapour deposition, we aim to achieve desired properties, including electronic, magnetic and conformational switching, tunable reactivity, or tailored electronic band gaps.

Firstly I aim to transform the way that we can currently detect disease through innovations in the design and development of nanomaterials-based biosensors that could be used to detect a number of diseases with global implications, such as cancer, malaria, heart failure and tuberculosis. These innovations in biosensor design will involve both building on our existing highly successful work on plasmonic biosensors and also involve the design and development of completely new polymersome and fluorescent based biosensors.

Until today, these extremely fast processes are little understood let alone utilized. With NearFieldAtto, strong-field driven phenomena at nanoscale metal structures will be explored to elucidate collective electron dynamics and to induce optical-field-driven currents -- on attosecond timescales. We will investigate the near-field of a nanotip, resulting from the collective dynamics, both in amplitude and phase. Conversely, we will use the tip as a nanometric sensor to map out the electric field inside the focus of a pulsed laser beam and will directly measure the local phase. In two-tip and molecular junctions, we will explore the ultrafast steering of electronic currents by optical fields, both over a nanometric gap and inside a molecule, taking advantage of the large near-field enhancement the systems offer.

My group has recently shown that attosecond physics phenomena can be observed at solids, namely at nanoscale tips [Kr&#195;&#188;ger et al., Nature 2011]. Hence, in NearFieldAtto we will employ techniques well known from attosecond physics with isolated objects, like gas-phase atoms and molecules, to steer laser-emitted electrons with the electric field of few-cycle laser pulses. We will use these electrons as nanometric probes to investigate optical properties of the solid state system and compare the results with those of isolated objects in gas-phase measurements. With two tips facing each other, we will realize a nanometric junction over which we will steer electrons with the optical field. A molecule placed between two tips will enable the investigation of a novel, ultrafast switching mechanism.

NearFieldAtto will bring attosecond physics a leap forward as compared to the state-of-the-art, will introduce strong-field physics into (quantum-)plasmonics, and will open the door towards lightwave or petahertz nano-electronics in metallic and molecular nano-systems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,012,733</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Neuro-Plasmonics"><Rcn>111602</Rcn><Nid>10054</Nid><HI>Fondazione Istituto Italiano Di Tecnologia, Italy</HI><Name>Neuro-Plasmonics</Name><PI>Francesco De Angelis</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Research neuronal signaling is the subject of a very large community, but progresses face a dense multi-scale dynamics involving signaling at the molecular, cellular and large neuronal network levels. Whereas the brain capabilities are most likely emerging from large neuronal networks, available electrophysiological methods limit our access to single cells and typically provides only a fragmented observation, on limited spatial/temporal scales. Therefore, broadening the spectrum of scales for observing neuronal signaling within large neuronal networks is a major challenge that can revolutionize our capability of studying the brain and its physio-pathological functions, as well as of deriving bio-inspired concepts to implement artificial system based on neuronal circuits. We propose the development of an innovative electro-plasmonic multifunctional platform that by combining different methodologies emerging from distant fields of Science and Technology will provide a radically new path for real time neurointerfacing at different scale levels:
1. The molecular scale: 3D plasmonic nanoantennas will give access to information at molecular level by means of enhanced spectroscopies with particular regard of time resolved Raman scattering.
2. The single-neuron scale within neuronal networks: by both in-cell and extra-cell couplings with 3D nanostructures which work at the same time as plasmonic antennas and CMOS 3D nanoelectrodes.
3. The scale of large neuronal networks: by CMOS high-density electrode arrays for spatially and temporally resolving neuronal signaling form thousands of measuring sites.
This is achieved by exploiting an innovative nanofabrication method able to realize 3D nanostructures which can work at the same time as plasmonic nanoantennas and as nanoelectrodes.

Recently, thanks to the progress in genomics and metagenomics, it has appeared that the biosynthetic potential of microorganisms and the complexity of the reactions catalyzed have been largely underestimated. Notably, enzymes using radical-based chemistry have been shown to be present in a very-large amount of biosynthetic pathways and to be widely distributed among all living organisms. The highly reactive radical species they generate give access to chemistries not accessible otherwise and allow them to catalyze unique and diverse reactions. Among them, the so-called ""radical SAM enzymes"" have attracted considerable attention in recent years. While, initially hypothesized to be a family with several hundreds of members, recent genomic analyses have revealed that there are several tens of thousands of radical SAM enzymes catalyzing more than sixty distinct biochemical processes.

Very recently, an ever increasing number of radical SAM enzymes has been discovered in the biosynthetic pathways of natural compounds. In several cases, it has been shown that, instead of involving non-ribosomal or polyketide synthases, microorganisms use radical SAM enzymes to extensively modify ribosomally synthesized peptides producing highly complex bioactive molecules. In the present project, we propose to develop a multidisciplinary approach to investigate promising radical SAM enzymes catalyzing peptide modifications and elucidate their unique mechanisms which, in many cases, have no counterparts in biochemistry and synthetic chemistry. Based on the unique and highly conserved radical SAM domain and the mechanistic insights gained, we will develop novel radical SAM enzymes as catalysts for the synthesis of new chemicals with original structures and properties using a synthetic biology approach."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,984,218</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NuMass"><Rcn>111579</Rcn><Nid>11822</Nid><HI>University Of Durham, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Neutrinos: a different portal to new physics Beyond the Standard Model</Name><PI>Silvia Pascoli</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In the past fifteen years, neutrino physics has revolutionised our understanding of particle physics. The discovery of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos have masses and mix: this is the only particle physics evidence of new physics beyond the Standard Model to date.

The NuMass project will focus on new physics at low energy scales, below the one reachable at the LHC. This approach is opposite to widely studied Standard Model extensions, which invoke new physics at scales so high that they will never be tested directly, and orthogonal to TeV models accessible at the LHC. The NuMass idea is that new particles in Nature could be hidden away not because they are too heavy but because, although light, they interact too weakly with ordinary matter. Neutrinos are by far the least understood of the standard fermions: if new particles are indeed at low scales, below the electroweak one, a likely scenario is that they couple more strongly to neutrinos than to other standard particles, e.g. quarks. Therefore, neutrinos are a unique portal into low energy physics.

The NuMass project will adopt a unique approach combining particle theory, phenomenology and cosmology. It will propose low energy extensions of the Standard Model and embed them in a consistent theory. It will study their signatures in experiments and their impact in the Early Universe. It will exploit the wide experimental programme, e.g. T2K, MicroBooNE, NOvA, GERDA, which will provide new data in the near future, to constrain the properties of the models.

The NuMass ultimate goal is to unveil a new theory of particles and interactions at low energy: its success would be groundbreaking as it would open a completely new perspective on the fundamental laws of Nature. New theoretical challenges would arise to explain why the new sector is light, and new experimental ones to test the new particles and interactions, leading to new directions in particle physics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,702,663</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="O2SENSE"><Rcn>189838</Rcn><Nid>10801</Nid><HI>University Of Bath, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Oxygen Sensing with Multimodality Imaging Probes</Name><PI>Sofia Ioana Pascu</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This programme will employ physical sciences and biomedicine techniques to develop a revolutionary approach to early cancer diagnosis and post-treatment monitoring aiming to address shortcomings in our current technology in oxygen sensing and imaging of hypoxic prostate tumours.

This proposal represents a gearing process towards the biomedical implementation of metal complexes and functionalised nanoparticles as novel synthetic platform systems for personalised diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancer and which can also be extended to neurodegenerative disorders. The work programme is a meeting point for interdisciplinary science that goes well beyond  state of the art. New chemical sensing devices will outstrip and supersede existing biopsy and imaging techniques used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancers.

The key advances of this programme will be:

(a) &#226;&#128;&#152;smart&#226;&#128;&#153; all-in-one multimodal imaging probes, whose sensitivities to levels of oxygen in cells (pO2) will be tunable to respond to various levels of hypoxia in tumors as desired. Our ultra-sensitive probes will be effective at low O2 concentrations and respond to reduced levels of hypoxia and under anoxia. This will surpass the mainstay in cancer diagnosis and therapy and provide increased selectivity for a wider range of tumours.

(b) new probes suitable for interlocked Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT), and optical imaging methodologies  Simultaneous in vitro and in vivo diagnostic information from radioimaging techniques (PET, SPECT) and optical imaging will provide in depth understanding of biological processes and lead to personalised medicine.

(c) new imaging tools for the first time will monitor the cellular biolocalisation of these probes by multiphoton optical imaging in nearIR regimes. These will drive the development of time-gated microscopy and multi-photon imaging with sensitivity for various levels of tumour hypoxia."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,886,876</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OutflowMagn"><Rcn>111406</Rcn><Nid>10097</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Magnetic fields and the outflows during the formation and evolution of stars</Name><PI>Wouter Henricus Theodorus Vlemmings</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The outflows of young and old stars play a crucial role in the cycle of matter in galaxies.  Stars and planetary systems are formed through complex physical processes during the collapse of gas clouds with outflows a required ingredient. At the end of a stars life, stellar outflows are the main source of heavy elements that are essential for the formation of stars, planets and life. Magnetic fields are one of the key factors governing the in particular the often observed collimated outflow. They might also be a key ingredient in driving stellar mass loss and are potentially essential for stabilizing accretion disks of, in particular, massive proto-stars. Only polarization observations at different spatial scales are able to measure the strength and structure of magnetic fields during the launching of outflows from young and old stars. Because stars in these evolutionary phases are highly obscured by dusty envelopes, their magnetic fields are best probed through observations of molecules and dust at submillimeter and radio wavelengths. In addition to its role, the origin of the magnetic field in these stellar phases is also still unknown and to determine it multi-wavelength observations are essential. The proposed research group will use state of the art submillimeter and radio instruments, integrated with self-consistent radiative transfer and magneto-hydrodynamic models, to examine the role and origin of magnetic fields during star formation and in the outflows from evolved stars. The group will search for planets around evolved stars to answer the elusive question on the origin of their magnetic field and determine the connection between the galactic magnetic field and that responsible for the formation of jets and potentially disks around young proto-stars. This fundamental new work, for which a dedicated research group is essential, will reveal the importance of magnetism during star formation as well as in driving and shaping the mass loss of evolved stars.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PALEOGENIE"><Rcn>111603</Rcn><Nid>10055</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>PAst Links in the Evolution of Ocean&#226;&#128;&#153;s Global ENvIronment and Ecology</Name><PI>Andrew John Ridgwell</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Species do not live in isolation, but adapt and ultimately, evolve, in relationship with other species as well as with their chemical and physical environment. In the marine environment, this interaction is intimately two-way &#226;&#128;&#147; the surface biogeochemical environment modulates the makeup of the pelagic ecosystem, yet at the same time, the ecosystem assemblage, by setting the strength of the biological pump and ultimately, in regulating the carbon and nutrient inventory of the ocean and atmospheric pCO2, influences the surface geochemical environment. Feedbacks, both negative and positive, must therefore exist between plankton ecology and global biogeochemical cycles. This has implications for understanding the geological record and particularly the response and recovery of marine ecosystems following major environmental perturbation, but also complicates making projections of future ocean changes.
The proposed project &#226;&#128;&#147; PALEOGENiE &#226;&#128;&#147; will directly address these challenges via the development of a unique coupled model of past plankton ecology and global biogeochemical cycles.

Both model and data will then be brought together in a unique attempt to better understanding the micropaleontological record of how sensitive marine ecosystems are to global change as well as how they recover. If successful, PALEOGENiE may help constrain the potential for adaptation as well as rates of evolutionary change, and ultimately could lead to meaningful insights and guidance for the next generation of Earth system models we need to better constrain the future response of marine ecosystems to continued fossil fuel combustion."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,930,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PHOENiCS"><Rcn>189857</Rcn><Nid>11799</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Photon-Spin Entanglement in Hybrid Cluster State Architectures</Name><PI>Mete Atature</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The last decade has witnessed quantum mechanics and information science merge for the debut of experimental quantum information processing. Despite the number of promising physical systems as candidates for quantum bits, scalability via a brute force approach faces serious technical obstacles. Developing distributed quantum networks is possibly the answer to the stringent demand of controllable interaction between high quality qubits. In these systems, the requirements are on the stationary qubits &#226;&#128;&#147; they need to be both isolated and accessible. The requirements on the flying qubits are that they need to be of reproducibly high quality, identical, and also they need to be able to interface well with the stationary qubits. We propose to realize an operational distributed solid-state quantum network relying on confined spins in quantum dots as qubits connected via a shared optical interconnection net used via single photons as flying qubits. Key milestones include high fidelity distant spin entanglement generation, implementation of spin entanglement purification, and formation of spin-photon hybrid cluster states in order to perform  one-way quantum computation protocols with incorporated memory.

We propose to develop novel program synthesis techniques, generating procedural code from declarative specifications.
Existing techniques apply synthesis at such a fine grain that they can never hope to generate code of the richness and complexity required by application-level programmers. In contrast, we aim to develop synthesis algorithms that leverage the collective programming knowledge captured in millions of open-source projects.
By using existing code fragments as components for synthesis, we enable synthesis to work at a higher-level of abstraction and synthesize realistic programs. Our approach represents a conceptual leap as it reduces the problem of generating code to the problem of checking whether existing code (or a combination of existing code fragments) is an appropriate solution. In some cases, this reduces the problem of synthesis to a problem of semantic code search. In other cases, it reduces the problem of synthesis over fine-grained components to synthesis as composition of coarse-grained components. The key problems are how to specify the desired behavior, how to find useful code fragments in the vast existing body of software, and the how to use synthesis to modify and assemble these fragments to form a program.

Our approach combines insights and techniques from research on program analysis, program synthesis, software engineering, and machine learning.

In this proposed program I aim to study chemical processes in nano-sized protein cages as mimics of bacterial organelles and to increase the general understanding of chemistry in confinement.
Towards this goal we will investigate the controlled in vivo loading of bacterial protein cages, i.e. encapsulins, with proteins and enzymes. This will allow us to study in detail the chemical conversions that take place inside such capsules and it will increase understanding about the reasons why certain processes inside these simple organisms are encased in the protein organelles.
Completely artificial protein organelles will be constructed by in vitro processes using the well-studied Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle virus cage. By employing DNA technology, cages will be loaded with a single enzyme, a sequence of enzymes or molecular probes. By obtaining this high level of control, we can not only study chemical conversions on the inside, but it will also allow us to monitor the physiochemical properties, such as internal pH, polarity and porosity of the protein mantle by encasing the relevant probes or host/guest systems.
In the ultimate stage of the proposed project the formed artificial organelles will be brought into cells in order to interact with the cell metabolism. CCMV has to be introduced by surface modification, while encapsulins can be formed inside these cells; albeit with different cargo. Such experiments have, to my knowledge, not been carried out and introducing new reactions inside these organisms can lead to new potentially interesting products or interfere with cell vitality. The latter can be of importance for the controlled disruption of bacterial cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QITBOX"><Rcn>111554</Rcn><Nid>11826</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut De Ciencies Fotoniques, Spain</HI><Name>Quantum Information Theory with black BOXes</Name><PI>Antonio Ac&#195;&#173;n</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"With QITBOX we aim to develop a novel device-independent framework for quantum information processing. In this framework, devices are seen as black boxes that only receive inputs and produce outputs. Our main objective is to understand what can and cannot be done for information processing using only the observed correlations among the devices. We will structure our effort along three main research lines: (i) Characterization of quantum correlations: the general objective will be to characterize those correlations that are possible among quantum devices; (ii) Protocols based on correlations: the general objective will be to understand how quantum correlations can be exploited in order to construct relevant information protocols and (iii) Applications to physical setups: here the previous results to concrete physical setups will be applied, such as the quantum-optical realizations of the protocols or the study of the non-local properties of many-body systems. The expected results of QITBOX are: (i) Novel methods for the characterization of quantum correlations, (ii) Improved or novel device-independent protocols, (iii) Proposals for feasible experimental implementations of these protocols and (iv) Novel methods for the study of many-body systems based on correlations. QITBOX is a highly-interdisciplinary project with implications in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering. The execution of the planned research work will provide a unifying framework for a Quantum Information Theory with black BOXes (hence the acronym). Such a framework will bring quantum information processing to an unprecedented level of abstraction, in which information protocols and primitives are defined without any reference to the internal physical working of the devices. This, in turn, will lead to much more robust practical implementations of quantum information protocols, closing the mismatch between theoretical requirements and experimental realisations."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,487,505</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QPROGRESS"><Rcn>185587</Rcn><Nid>11988</Nid><HI>Stichting Centrum Voor Wiskunde En Informatica, Netherlands</HI><Name>"Progress in quantum computing: Algorithms, communication, and applications"</Name><PI>Ronald De Wolf</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Quantum computing combines computer science, physics and mathematics to fundamentally speed up computation using effects from quantum physics. Starting in the early 1980s with Feynman and Deutsch, and gaining momentum in the 1990s with the algorithms of Shor and Grover, this very interdisciplinary area has potentially far reaching consequences. While a large-scale quantum computer has not been built yet, experimenters are getting more optimistic: a recent prediction is that it will take another 10-15 years.

However, the tasks where such a quantum computer would be able to significantly outperform classical computers are still quite limited, which lends urgency to finding new applications. This proposal will find more such tasks, and produce new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of quantum computing. It is divided into three workpackages:

1. Algorithms &amp; complexity. Find new quantum algorithms that are more efficient than the best classical algorithms, for example for matrix multiplication and graph problems. Extend our knowledge of the ultimate limitations of quantum algorithms, and possible parallelization (which has barely been studied so far).

2. Quantum communication. Communication complexity analyzes the amount of communication needed to solve distributed computational tasks, where separate parties each hold part of the input. Find new
distributed problems where quantum communication outperforms classical communication, and explore links with fundamental physics issues like the role of entanglement and Bell-inequality violations.

3. Classical applications. Apply the newly developed mathematical tools of quantum computing to analyze problems in other areas, as we recently did for linear programs for the traveling salesman problem. This
third workpackage will have impact regardless of progress in building a quantum computer.

So far this field of Quantum Chemistry has been dominated by theory. The difficulty has been to realize in the laboratory low enough collisional velocities between neutral reactants, such that the quantum wave nature could be observed. Recently we have demonstrated a new way of studying cold reactive collisions by magnetically merging two fast neutral supersonic beams. After 40 years where the reactive scattering temperature was limited to above 5 K we were able to continuously tune collision energies from hundreds of Kelvin down to 10 mK temperature, a reduction of almost three orders of magnitude [A. B. Henson et. al, Science 338, 234, 2012]. Importantly, we were able to show that at low temperatures quantum effects start dominating reactive dynamics with the first observation of orbiting resonances in a reactive collision. We propose to extend our novel method to study chemical reactions in the regime of Cold Chemistry where the reactants&#226;&#128;&#153;s de Broglie wavelength becomes larger compared to the characteristic interaction range. Theoretical predictions at low temperatures are extremely sensitive to the parameters used, routinely differing by orders of magnitude leading to contradictions waiting to be settled by experiment.
Our ability to reach low enough collision energies and resolve scattering resonances will be used to bring a radical change to transient species spectroscopy. We believe that our work will not only test the central tenets of Quantum Chemistry, but will also provide valuable information to other fields, such as Astrochemistry helping to understand the synthesis of various molecules in interstellar space at temperatures 10 K and below.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,982,908</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QuantStro"><Rcn>185575</Rcn><Nid>12010</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Quantum-Degenerate Strontium: Mixtures, Molecules, and Many-Body Physics</Name><PI>Florian Schreck</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In 2009 my research team created the first Bose-Einstein condensate of strontium. This breakthrough is the foundation of my research program, which will investigate quantum many-body phenomena with a focus on quantum magnetism and physics related to the quantum Hall effect. We are especially interested in studying unusual, strongly correlated quantum states, among them states with topological order.

The unique properties of strontium make it ideally suited to follow four different approaches to this physics.

1) We will immerse our quantum gas into artificial gauge fields, which e.g. let neutral atoms behave as if they were charged particles in a strong magnetic field. These fields will allow us to study quantum Hall states or topological insulators.

2) We will study SU(N) magnetism, which is an unusual form of magnetism not found in condensed matter, but of high interest for theory. A high degree of frustration can lead to spin liquid behaviour.

3) We will use sympathetic Pomeranchuk cooling of a potassium spin mixture by fermionic strontium to reach low entropy quantum phases. Our goal is to study magnetically ordered states and frustrated antiferromagnetism.

4) We will create RbSr ground-state molecules, which are polar, open-shell molecules. They will allow us to engineer unique quantum-many body systems with long-range interactions, e.g. lattice-spin models that can support topological states.

We will pursue this research not only on our existing Rb/Sr quantum gas mixture apparatus, but we will construct a new K/Sr quantum gas microscope. This machine will be very valuable to explore exotic quantum states. The properties of strontium will enable an innovative single-atom detection method based on shelving in a metastable state and quench cooling, which will allow us to take internal state-resolved, 3D, or super-resolution images of the lattice gas.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,799,148</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REINS"><Rcn>192408</Rcn><Nid>13474</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Responsible Intelligent Systems</Name><PI>Johannes Maria Broersen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>I propose to develop a formal framework for automating responsibility, liability and risk checking for intelligent systems.

The goal is to answer three central questions, corresponding to three sub-projects of the proposal: (1) What are suitable formal logical representation formalisms for knowledge of agentive responsibility in action, interaction and joint action? (2) How can we formally reason about the evaluation of grades of responsibility and risks relative to normative systems? (3) How can we perform computational checks of responsibilities in complex intelligent systems interacting with human agents? To answer the first two questions, we will design logical specification languages for collective responsibilities and for probability-based graded responsibilities, relative to normative systems. To answer the third question, we will design suitable translations to related logical formalisms, for which optimized model checkers and theorem provers exist.

In a five year long collaboration with Sorin Popa, we solved many long-standing open problems in this area, including superrigidity theorems for group measure space II_1 factors, results on the possible fundamental groups of II_1 factors, and uniqueness theorems for Cartan subalgebras.

In the first part of the project, we want to establish new unique Cartan decomposition theorems for II_1 factors coming from hitherto intractable groups. Using methods coming from Lie groups, ergodic theory and geometric group theory, we want to reach such results for lattices in higher rank simple Lie groups, and for countable groups with nonvanishing L^2-Betti numbers. An important intermediate step will be the unique Cartan decomposition of Bernoulli crossed products.

Secondly we want to prove classification theorems for type III factors that are equally strong as the existing results for the type II_1 case. This includes a complete classification of the noncommutative Bernoulli shifts of the free groups and will require an intricate combination of Tomita/Takesaki and deformation/rigidity theory.

The methods developed so far bring within reach an attack on two of the most important open problems in operator algebras and functional analysis: the free group factor problem and Connes's rigidity conjecture. The exact progress on these problems is of course unforeseeable, but it is sure that the research on these problems will lead to an even deeper interaction between diverse areas of mathematics as operator algebras, group theory, functional analysis, ergodic theory, and descriptive set theory.

Billions of dollars have been spent trying to cure primary tumors but very little was spent in trying to detect or kill the highly aggressive tumor cells that cause disease spreading.  One of the reasons is that single cell studies of rare cells in blood still present a large challenge.  Single cell analysis remains tedious with many different instruments and protocols, typically taking a few days of hands-on work.  This slows down research, but also hinders the translation to application in future clinical practice.  In SCALPEL, we envisage a high-content, high-throughput cell imaging and sorting platform, more compact and easier to use than any existing single cell analyzer.   The high content results from lensfree digital imaging of single cells on a high speed CMOS active optical pixel matrix to analyze the morphology of cells.  The high throughput results from a highly parallelized fluidic matrix that steers cells at high speed over the CMOS imaging blocks.  Lensfree cell sorters can be realized in a cheap and compact platform, as all optomechanical components (lenses, detectors, nozzles,...) are replaced by nanoelectronics, advanced imaging and signal processing technology.

SCALPEL aims to perform a full feasibility study of this concept and will require to investigate the ultimate limits in:  1) maximizing image resolution and sensitivity to single cell morphological features obtained via lensfree holographic imaging; 2) maximizing cell manipulation speed in microfluidic systems via a high degree of parallelization; and 3) digital image signal processing with extremely low latency at reasonable power consumption.

It permeates and is intertwined with almost all aspects of our government, economy, and society.

From a security perspective, we observe is the tremendous dependency on communication that is being created. Many of the processes we describe above would grind to a halt should communication become unavailable. Although we cannot conclusively
answer what the impact of a 1-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, or 1-week lack of Internet communication on our society would be, but anecdotal evidence
indicates that even short outages have a profound negative impact on governmental, economic, and societal processes. We can only surmise
what the impact of a week-long Internet outage would look like after witnessing the almost complete halt in productivity of a major institution that lost email connectivity for 2 days.

Unfortunately, the current Internet is quite brittle, and has not been designed for high availability in the face of malicious adversaries. Recent patches to
improve Internet security and availability have been constrained by the current Internet architecture and business processes.
Consequently, the current state of safety and availability of the Internet is not commensurate with its importance. Numerous aspects of our society depend on a brittle network that runs with a relatively
small investment compared to its importance.

This would allow for a best-of-both-worlds scenario with the development of robust synthetic materials, with tuneable properties including crystallinity, thermal properties, shape memory, and self-healing. Most importantly, by developing an empirical and perhaps even model-based connection between polymer sequence / composition and polymer properties it would be possible to begin to design new materials in a rational and knowledge-based way. Indeed, it could be argued that this advance would ultimately solve one of the major problems in materials science, multiscale modelling of polymer properties. It seems certain that achieving even a portion of these goals would open up a completely new area of material science. Hence, following the model of DNA, we propose developing a number of new routes for the preparation of sequence controlled polymers (SCPs) and specifically a new class of SCPs which are capable of replication and ultimately evolution. This will produce polymers and self-assembled structures with unprecedented physical properties and the ability to functionally interact and communicate with biological materials. Realizing this goal will allow us to bring new function to chemistry, through expanding chemical space to access new precision polymers</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,324,271</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SEARCHLIGHT"><Rcn>185672</Rcn><Nid>10725</Nid><HI>Fundacion Imdea Networks, Spain</HI><Name>A new communication paradigm for future very high speed wireless networks</Name><PI>Joerg Carsten Widmer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Due to the tremendous growth in mobile devices such as smartphones, tablet PCs, and laptops over the past years, a larger and larger fraction of Internet traffic is delivered wirelessly. Dealing with this vast increase in traffic is one of the most important challenges for future wireless networks. State-of-the-art wireless communication already operates close to Shannon capacity. The only viable option to further increase data rates is to use high bandwidth channels in the very high frequency part of the radio spectrum. However, this spectrum suffers from high attenuation and signal absorption, restricting communication primarily to line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios. This in turn requires a radical rethinking of wireless networking. We envision that future wireless networks will consist of many highly directional LOS channels for communication between access points (APs) and end devices. Such an environment is extremely dynamic, in particular for mobile devices. At the same time, such channels experience very little interference and resources that would otherwise be used to handle interference can now be used to further increase achievable data rates.

We propose to build a wireless network architecture that maintains directional LOS channels between several APs and (mobile) end devices. Data is transmitted via all of these channels and end device uses multiple antennas to receive and decode several such data streams simultaneously. The main complexity of the design lies in the selection of APs as well as the beamforming directions of their antennas, given the large number of end devices that future wireless networks will have to support. To speed up this decision process, the system maintains a map of the radio environment and learns likely sequences of beamforming patterns and APs. This further allows to intelligently switch off APs to improve energy efficiency. We believe that such a design is the key element for the scalability of future wireless networks."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,719,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SLIDEQUAKE"><Rcn>111555</Rcn><Nid>11825</Nid><HI>Institut De Physique Du Globe De Paris, France</HI><Name>Detection and understanding of landslides by observing and modelling gravitational flows and generated earthquakes</Name><PI>Anne Mangeney</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The goal of the project is to take a major step in improving the detection and understanding of landslides and their modelling at the field scale through the analysis of generated seismic waves. The seismic signal generated by landslides (i. e. landquakes) provides a unique tool to estimate the properties of the flow and its dynamics. Indeed, the stress applied by the landslide to the ground, which generates seismic waves, is highly sensitive to the flow history and therefore to the physical properties during mass emplacement. The strategy will be to combine a very accurate description of the landslide source, and the simulation and measurements of landquakes from the laboratory to the natural scale, by leading an ambitious interdisciplinary project involving numerical modelling, laboratory experiments and observation. The methodology will be to (1) develop thin layer models for granular flows over a complex 3D topography to alleviate the high computational costs related to the description of the real topography, taking into account the static/flowing transition and the fluid/grains mixture, both playing a key role in natural flows; (2) simulate the generated seismic waves by coupling landslide models to state-of-the-art wave propagation models. An ambitious objective will be to develop efficient coupling methods; (3) develop laboratory experiments of seismic emissions generated by granular flows to test the models and understand the physical processes at work; (4) analyse, simulate and invert natural landquakes making use of underexploited high-quality seismic and geomorphological data, in particular on volcanoes.
An ultimate objective will be to design a new generation of landslides models, reliable methods and operational tools for detection of gravitational flows, and interpretation of seismic data in terms of landslide properties. This tools will be transferred to the scientific community and to the observatories in charge of monitoring landslide activity.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,241</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPCND"><Rcn>185612</Rcn><Nid>10738</Nid><HI>University Of Southampton, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Supernovae: Physics and Cosmology in the Next Decade</Name><PI>Mark Sullivan</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Exploding stars, or supernovae, impact upon many diverse areas of astrophysics, from galaxy formation, to stellar evolution, to cosmology and studies of dark energy.

As we move towards the next frontier of defining a quantum theory of gravity, it is clear that they will continue to play a predominant role. The current project is aimed at obtaining a comprehensive  understanding of the dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems, exploiting various symmetry properties that one expects on physical grounds. Specifically, the aim is to come up with effective descriptions of a wide class of quantum dynamics in gravitational and non-gravitational theories using the holographic gauge/gravity correspondence.

One of the primary strands of the proposed research involves a critical examination of gravitational theories with higher spin symmetry. We will investigate the phase structure of such theories, the nature of gravitational solutions and notions of classical geometry in the presence of the enlarged gauge symmetry. Using appropriate generalizations of the gauge/gravity correspondence we will try to give gauge invariant characterizations of these concepts and further explore how such higher spin theories can be realized in string theory. A related strand of research concerns a deeper understanding of the gauge/gravity correspondence itself,  with focus on figuring out how collective behaviour of strongly coupled field theories leads to the emergence of extra symmetries, such as local diffeomorphisms in the dual description. Along the way we will also develop effective descriptions for collective dynamics of strongly coupled quantum degrees of freedom, both in and out of equilibrium.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,400,758</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SSS"><Rcn>185547</Rcn><Nid>11972</Nid><HI>It University Of Copenhagen, Denmark</HI><Name>Scalable Similarity Search</Name><PI>Rasmus Pagh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Similarity search is the task of identifying, in a collection of items, the ones that are &#226;&#128;&#156;similar&#226;&#128;&#157; to a given

recognition, statistics, and machine learning) where data sets are often big, high dimensional, and
possibly noisy. State-of-the-art methods for similarity search offer only weak guarantees when faced with
big data. Either the space overhead is excessive (1000s of times larger than the space for the data itself),
or the work needed to report the similar items may be comparable to the work needed to go through all
items (even if just a tiny fraction of the items are similar). As a result, many applications have to resort to
the use of ad-hoc solutions with only weak theoretical guarantees.

This proposal aims at strengthening the theoretical foundation of scalable similarity search, and
developing novel practical similarity search methods backed by theory. In particular we will:

- Leverage new types of embeddings that are kernelized, asymmetric, and complex-valued.

- Consider statistical models of noise in data, and design similarity search data structures whose
performance guarantees are phrased in statistical terms.

- Build a new theory of the communication complexity of distributed, dynamic similarity search,
emphasizing the communication bottleneck present in modern computing infrastructures.

The objective is to produce new methods for similarity search that are: 1) Provably robust, 2) scalable
to large and high-dimensional data sets, 3) substantially more resource efficient than current state-ofthe-

The major goal of this proposal is to remedy this persistent condition of uncertainty and controversy. The solution to the TP-AGB star conundrum will be provided by a new approach, which stands on the optimised integration of a) state-of-the-art theoretical tools to account for the complex physics of TP-AGB stars (evolution, nucleosynthesis, pulsation, winds, dust formation, etc.), and b) exceptionally high-quality observations of resolved TP-AGB stellar populations in stars clusters and nearby galaxies (Magellanic Clouds, M31, dwarf galaxies up to 4 Mpc) with reliable measurements of their star formation histories. We will adopt a global calibration method, in which TP-AGB evolution models are required to simultaneously reproduce a set of well-defined observational constraints (distributions of luminosities, colours, pulsation periods, dust mass-loss rates, expansion velocities of dusty envelopes, etc.). This project will deepen our understanding of TP-AGB physics profoundly, and provide wide-spread community benefits as well. We will publicly release well-tested and reliable ``TP-AGB products'', including stellar tracks, isochrones in all photometric systems, and chemical yields for both gas and dust.

Although almost all the components of any portable device become smaller, lighter and more powerful by the months, electrochemical technology is far from presenting us with the ideal battery. From a different perspective, the equation mobile device = casing + electronics + battery could be simplified by merging the structural function of the casing with that of the energy source of the battery into a structural battery. This approach would immediately reduce weight and size of our mobile devices.

This project aims at investigating the effect of electrochemical-mechanical interactions on the mechanical performance of structural batteries. Understanding and controlling mechanical degradation in structural batteries is of prime importance given the dual structural-electrical function of these devices. In fact, the main concern when dealing with structural batteries is whether the internal stresses caused by external loads will influence the performance of the battery, and, conversely, whether the functioning of the battery will have a detrimental effect on its mechanical properties.  The complexity of these processes can only be addressed with dedicated computational techniques. This project offers a unique opportunity for the design and implementation of the first multiphysics and multiscale computational framework for the analysis of structural batteries. Macroscale processes originating at the level of a basic components will be elucidated through physically-based constitutive laws.

The overall impact of this project will be felt across many research communities.

While one usually considers the substrate to be perfectly rigid, in many practically important circumstances the surface exhibits strong elastic deformations. Examples of such &#226;&#128;&#156;Soft Wetting&#226;&#128;&#157; phenomena are drops spreading on a gel, or roller bearings under heavy loads. Given the increasing technology to control and tune properties of soft matter, there is a strong need for better understanding of: (i) interaction of surface forces (capillarity) and elasticity, and (ii) coupling between fluid flow and visco-elastic dissipation in the solid. The central objective of the proposed research is to establish the governing principles for Soft Wetting and to develop tools for describing practically relevant situations.

The current approach to elastocapillary interactions is almost exclusively based on macroscopic descriptions, leading to contradictory results. I propose to change this by employing truly microscopic methods, namely Molecular Dynamics simulations and (simplified) Density Functional Theory. This will reveal how elastic stresses &#226;&#128;&#147; induced by liquid interactions on a molecular level &#226;&#128;&#147; are transmitted in the superficial layers of the solid. From a macroscopic perspective, there is mounting evidence that the visco-elastic rheology of the solid is very important for the dynamics of Soft Wetting: for example, drops spread much more slowly than expected on soft elastomeric surfaces. My goal is to reveal the connection between macroscopic motion and the rheology of the substrate. Experimentally, we combine high-speed visualization of drop spreading with a complete characterization of the substrate rheology. These experiments are complemented by Lattice Boltzmann simulations that account explicitly for visco-elastic substrates. As a whole, the project will provide basic knowledge and methods for a broad class of Soft Wetting phenomena.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,782,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SpecMAT"><Rcn>189840</Rcn><Nid>11812</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Spectroscopy of exotic nuclei in a Magnetic Active Target</Name><PI>Riccardo Raabe</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>SpecMAT aims at providing crucial experimental information to answer key questions about the structure of atomic nuclei:

- What are the forces driving the shell structure in nuclei and how do they change in nuclei far from stability?

- Do we understand shape coexistence in nuclei, and what are the mechanisms controlling its appearance?

The position of natural and &#226;&#128;&#156;intruder&#226;&#128;&#157; shells will be mapped in two critical regions, the neutron-rich nuclei around Z = 28 and the neutron-deficient nuclei around Z = 82. The centroids of the shell strength are derived from the complete spectroscopy of those systems in nucleon-transfer measurements. This method will be applied for the first time in the region of neutron-deficient Pb nuclei.

In SpecMAT (Spectroscopy of exotic nuclei in a Magnetic Active Target) a novel instrument will overcome the present challenges in performing such measurements with very weak beams of unstable nuclei. It combines high luminosity, high efficiency and a very large dynamic range and allows detection of both charged-particle and gamma-ray radiation. The instrument owns its remarkable performances to a number of advanced technologies concerning the use of electronics, gaseous detectors and gamma-ray detectors in a magnetic field.

The SpecMAT detector will be coupled to the HIE-ISOLDE facility for the production and post-acceleration of radioactive ion beams in construction at CERN in Geneva. HIE-ISOLDE will provide world-unique beams thanks to the use of the proton injector of the CERN complex.

If successful, SpecMAT at HIE-ISOLDE will produce specific results in nuclear structure which cannot be reached by other programmes elsewhere. Such results will have a significant impact on the present theories and models of the atomic nucleus.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,944,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="StrucLim"><Rcn>192415</Rcn><Nid>13457</Nid><HI>Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia Renyi Alfred Matematikai Kutatointezet, Hungary</HI><Name>Limits of discrete structures</Name><PI>Balazs Szegedy</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Built on decades of deep research in ergodic theory, Szemeredi's regularity theory and statistical physics, a new subject is emerging whose goal is to study convergence and limits of various structures.

Catalysis is a vital component of many potential solutions to contemporary global issues and breakthroughs in catalysis would inevitably bring about change.
Among the most prominent challenges of the 21st century is the functionalization of abundant but unreactive C-H bonds as development of these transformations would enable the sustainable formation of new carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds, needed for the construction of vitally important complex molecules. Even more challenging is the direct, enantioselective functionalization of unreactive C-H and C-C double bonds which would lead to valuable, optically active products which are highly desirable for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemical industries.
The general objective of this proposal is to redefine the synthetic methodology for obtaining highly valuable, optically active products, used in life science applications, by using novel strategies, involving three unprecedented concepts which employ visible light available from the sun.

The main contribution that destabilises the electroweak scale comes from a top-quark loop. The key for addressing the naturalness problem is thus identifying the top partners that are stabilizing the weak scale.
We consider the following two general possibilities in which the partners have escaped detection:
(I) the top partners are light but elusive, this calls for a theoretical explanation as well as for new innovative experimental techniques for signal exhumation;
(II) the partners are  relatively heavy and the signal would consist of energetic (boosted) top from the decay of its partner. I plan to carry out a comprehensive research program designed to attack these challenges, and I believe that I am uniquely prepared to do this.  Regarding (I), as proven below, current searches have not considered the impact of non-trivial flavor physics, e.g. splitting between the first two generation partner masses, as well as the mixing between the top-partners and other flavors. The consequences are: (i) significantly weaker mass bounds on some of the partners (e.g. the scharm, charm-supersymmetric-partner);  (ii) improved naturalness as even the stops (or fermion partners) can be lighter; and (iii) modified Higgs rates in composite models.
Regarding (II), with collaborators I have been the first one to understand the difficulties of dealing with highly boosted top jets, and since then I was intensively involved in developing theoretical as well as novel techniques to study them, including coauthoring two important papers with the CDF and ATLAS collaborations.
To uncover these new possibilities, expertise in collider phenomenology and flavor physics is required. I have a proven record in these frontiers and thus, given the required support, am well positioned to pursue this quest to save naturalness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,434,154</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TOPOTRONICS"><Rcn>111578</Rcn><Nid>10062</Nid><HI>Universiteit Twente, Netherlands</HI><Name>Topological Josephson devices as a novel platform for creating and controlling non-Abelian anyons</Name><PI>Alexander Brinkman</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Surprisingly, in two-dimensional systems quasi-particles may exist that are neither fermions nor bosons. When these particles are interchanged, their joint quantum mechanical wave function is predicted to pick up any phase in between 0 (as for bosons) and pi (as for fermions), hence the name anyons.

Even more intriguing is the class of non-Abelian anyons where interchange of particles completely changes the ground state of the system. This phenomenon lays at the heart of a wealth of theoretical proposals for new types of quantum statistics and topological quantum computation that is robust against decoherence. While theory has well advanced, experimental realizations possess their own challenges and are seriously lacking behind.

It is the objective of this proposal to experimentally realize a platform to detect and control non-Abelian anyons. We propose to combine the particle-hole symmetry of a superconductor with the spin-momentum locking at the surface of a topological insulator. Topological Josephson junctions are predicted to host Majorana type bound states at vortices. We propose to artificially create Josephson vortices at the junction of three phase-biased superconducting islands and to control and braid multiple Majorana states to prove their non-Abelian anyon character.

In preliminary experiments we have shown, as one of the first groups in the world, to be able to induce superconductivity in a topological insulator by the proximity effect. This puts our group in a unique position to open up the field of topological Josephson physics. The great technological challenges of the present proposal lay in the development of topological insulator materials with higher surface mobility and their integration into Josephson electronic circuitry with multiple phase biased superconducting islands. For the phase biasing as well as the read-out of the Majorana states after braiding on-chip SQUID based current amplifiers will be developed."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANS-NANO"><Rcn>111543</Rcn><Nid>11830</Nid><HI>Fondazione Istituto Italiano Di Tecnologia, Italy</HI><Name>"Advancing the Study of Chemical, Structural and Surface Transformations in Colloidal Nanocrystals"</Name><PI>Liberato Manna</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Colloidal inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) are among the most investigated nanomaterials in Nanoscience due to their high versatility. Research on NCs went through much advancement lately, especially on synthesis, assembly and on the study of their transformations, most notably via cation exchange (all fields in which the PI has contributed already). However, the integration of NCs with fabrication tools that employ conditions such as irradiation, etching and annealing is at a very early stage since we do not have a systematic knowledge of what transformations are triggered in the NCs under those conditions. Also, an issue related to the incorporation of NCs in materials/devices is whether, over time, the NCs will remain as they are, or they will transform into other structures. Plus, these transformations in NCs are poorly studied as they require fast recording techniques. This proposal will embark on an ambitious investigation of post-synthetic transformations in solution-grown NCs: by advancing the understanding of various aspects of chemical, structural and surface transformation of NCs, we will uncover new fabrication techniques that will employ such nanostructures as the key ingredients. This in turn will have a strong impact in opto-electronics, as several electronic components entirely made of NCs will be delivered. Four objectives are targeted: i) developing radically new sets of experimental tools for the investigation of chemical transformations in NCs, above all the ability to monitor in real time these transformations; ii) developing solution-grown nanostructures able to undergo programmed transformations under a defined stimulus; iii) understanding the role of irradiation on the fate of surface ligands and on cation exchange reactions in NCs; iv) combining chemical, structural and surface transformations towards NC-based opto-electronics. The success of the proposal hinges on the proven capabilities of the PI, with ample support from the host Institution."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,430,720</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSITION"><Rcn>185639</Rcn><Nid>12020</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>"Large Deviations and Non Equilibrium Phase Transitions for Turbulent Flows, Climate, and the Solar System"</Name><PI>Freddy Bouchet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of this project is to predict and compute extremely rare but essential trajectories in complex physical systems. We will compute rare transitions trajectories, first between two different turbulent attractors in models of planetary jet dynamics, and second between two configurations of ocean currents for a model of the thermohaline circulation. We will compute the dynamics and the probability for collisions between two planets in the solar system, on time scales of order of billions of years. We will evaluate rare events that lead to extremely large drags or torques on objects embedded in turbulent flows, directly from the dynamics. Because of the huge range of time scales, all those trajectories are not accessible through direct numerical simulations.

The project's unity stems from the methodology based on large-deviations theory. Large deviation rate functions generalize the concept of entropy or free energy in non-equilibrium extended systems: they provide a global characterization of their most probable state, their large fluctuations and their phase transitions. Impressive explicit computations of large deviation rate functions have been recently performed in simple non-equilibrium systems. The main aim of this project is to bridge the gap between those extremely interesting new concepts and algorithms, and complex dynamical systems such as turbulent flows, semi-realistic models of fluids related to climate dynamics, or the long time behavior of the solar system.

In order to achieve this goal, we will use macroscopic fluctuation theory, instanton theory, and other analytical methods in order to compute explicitly large deviation rate functions for essential macroscopic quantities (the velocity or density fields). We will also develop and use algorithms specifically dedicated at computing the statistics of extremely rare trajectories, based on the generalization of importance sampling implemented through cloning or multilevel splitting methods."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,178,760</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRITOS"><Rcn>111427</Rcn><Nid>10095</Nid><HI>Kungliga Tekniska Hoegskolan, Sweden</HI><Name>TRansItions and Turbulence Of complex Suspensions</Name><PI>Luca Brandt</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of this project is to forge a physical understanding of the transitions and of the turbulent flow of semi-dilute/dense non-colloidal suspensions, for different particle features and suspending fluids.
It is estimated that 10% of the world energy consumption is due to the transport and handling of granular materials of which particle suspensions are an important part. A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying the flow of particle suspensions, the transition to turbulence and the turbulence characteristics is crucial for many important practical applications involving engineered complex fluids, such as pastes and paper pulp. A better prediction and control of the flow of suspensions will therefore have a huge impact.
Complex fluids are multiscale by nature where the physics at the microscale affects the macroscopic behaviour of the flow and vice versa giving rise to surprising and spectacular phenomena as well as making this one of the most important practical problem still to solve. Investigating the mechanisms by which the system microstructure determines the macroscopic flow properties and vice versa will not only give valuable insights into the nature of flowing suspensions but also will also lead to new ways to model and control it. Future generations of engineering CFD tools will have to contain models for complex suspensions. The fundamental approach proposed here, combined with challenging scientific and engineering examples backed up by experimental evidence, will make this possible and demonstrate it to a wider engineering community. The proposed project is based on highly accurate simulations of multiphase flow systems and state-of-the-art experiments. Such a holistic approach will enable us to understand the underlying mechanisms of instabilities and suspension turbulence and to develop accurate criteria for their prediction far in advance of what we could achieve with either approach separately."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,350</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TheMoDS"><Rcn>185671</Rcn><Nid>12315</Nid><HI>University Of Cyprus, Cyprus</HI><Name>Theories and Models of the Dark Sector: Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Gravity</Name><PI>Constantinos Skordis</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Modern cosmology assumes that General Relativity (GR) is the correct description of gravity on large scales. With this assumption and according to current data, the cosmological model needs in addition the existence of a Dark Sector: Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We know very little about the nature of DM and it is yet to be detected experimentally. The simplest form of DE compatible with the data, a cosmological constant, has a value incompatible with our understanding of Quantum Field Theory. Given that the extrapolation of GR to cosmological scales has not been tested it is possible that the inference of the Dark Sector also needs to be revised.

I propose to (i) determine the nature of DM and DE to a level not achieved before, (ii) test gravity on cosmological scales and (iii) test the screening of new gravitational degrees of freedom in the solar system. The first two goals will require the use of my general framework to parameterize field equations [Skordis, PRD 79, 123527 (2008); Baker, Ferreira &amp; Skordis, PRD 87, 024015 (2013)]. My team will use this framework to construct simple models and observations to place limits on their parameters. We will employ the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations from ESA's Planck Surveyor and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We will determine the sensitivity of the CMB lensing to the properties of DM and theories of gravity. To break possible degeneracies these data will be supplemented with large-scale structure data, weak lensing and red-shift space distortions. We will also perform forecasting for ESA's EUCLID mission which will give us a handle on how well we will constrain GR with cosmology in the future. For the final goal (iii) we will employ the method of [Padilla &amp; Saffin, JHEP 1207, 122 (2012)] to construct a perturbative expansion of theories that exhibit screening, inside the screening radius. We will determine the compatibility of such theories with solar system and other strong-field data.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,150,691</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TopCoup"><Rcn>111222</Rcn><Nid>11836</Nid><HI>Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Bonn, Germany</HI><Name>Determination of top couplings in associated top pair events using ATLAS data</Name><PI>Markus Cristinziani</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The discovery of a new particle, compatible with the Higgs boson, at the Large Hadron Collider, marked a major triumph of the Standard Model of particle physics. However, many fundamental questions remain and direct or indirect evidence of new physics can be probed with the large number of proton-proton collision data, collected in 2011 and 2012 at 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy.

With this proposal we plan to exploit the large sample of top-quark pair events that is already recorded, and the sample that will be collected from 2015 onwards, at the ultimate energy of 14 TeV. In particular we plan to study the coupling of top quarks to neutral bosons, by measuring the production of associated tt&#204;&#132;&#206;&#179;, tt&#204;&#132;Z and tt&#204;&#132;H. Anomalous electromagnetic or weak couplings could be uncovered by studying kinematic properties of the resulting photon or Z-boson, once the signal is established. By studying the tt&#204;&#132;H production in detail the mechanism of Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to fermions will be tested, possibly providing important confidence in the characterisation of the new boson.

In all measurements we plan to include the tt&#204;&#132; dilepton channel, that, despite the smaller branching fraction has typically superior signal-to-noise ratios. An essential part of the programme will be the calibration of the b-tagging algorithms, where we plan to use tt&#204;&#132; events.

The Applicant&#226;&#128;&#153;s ERC StG has been very successful and opened new doors to several new avenues of pioneering research that were not even conceivable before the work was done. This work extends out from the knowledge achievements of the StG into new, exciting research areas that are completely different. This is a strategically vital to understand yet poorly developed area due to legacy nuclear waste. This project will deliver innovation through studying: (i) uranium-nitrogen triple bonds as benchmarks for uranium bonding and for generating new small molecule activation and materials applications; (ii) homologation of CO to close the carbon cycle and sustainably remove reliance on dwindling oil; (iii) single molecule magnets that have applications in data storage, quantum computing, spintronics; (iv) uranium-metal bonds which act as exemplars for intermetalloids and bonding. This CoG will afford the freedom and impetus via consolidated funding to undertake fundamental, speculative research to deliver &#226;&#128;&#152;big-hits&#226;&#128;&#153;, whole new fields of actinide chemistry, and, based on this higher platform of understanding, new ways of thinking. This will induce previously impossible paradigm shifts in uranium chemistry and be included in future textbooks.

Specifically, we plan to realize and study pairing with orbital angular momentum and pairing induced by long-range interaction. Besides the fundamental interest in unravelling unconventional pairing mechanisms and the interplay between superfluidity and quantum magnetism, our project will also lead to gaining experimental control over topologically protected quantum states. This will pave the way for future topological quantum computers, which are particularly robust to environmental decoherence.
Our project addresses three different aspects: (1) We plan to realize p-wave superfluids in two dimensions. This quantum phase exhibits topological excitations (vortices) with anyonic statistics and an isomorphism to the fractional quantum-Hall effect. We will investigate the unusual properties of p-wave superfluids, such as Majorana fermions, i.e. quasiparticles being their own anti-particles, which are predicted to be localized at vortices. This will boost the long-standing efforts in the cold atoms and condensed matter communities to understand topological states of matter. (2) We aim to realize d-wave pairing in optical lattices using a novel experimental approach. d-wave pairing is closely related to high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates and we are interested in exploring its interplay with magnetic order. Superfluidity and magnetic order are antagonistic phenomena from a conventional BCS-theory point-of-view and hence several fundamental questions will be answered. (3) We plan to induce long-range interactions using a high-finesse optical cavity leading to a light-induced pairing mechanism. We will search for Cooper pairing in spin-polarized Fermi gases mediated by the interaction of Fermions with a quantized light field. This provides access to a new class of combined light-matter quantum states.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,925,525</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ViDa"><Rcn>189848</Rcn><Nid>8693</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Transforming Raw Data into Information through Virtualization</Name><PI>Anastasia Ailamaki</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The unprecedented evolution of computing power, combined with the decreasing costs of computation and storage infrastructure, has revolutionized all scientific fields and enterprises; at the heart of this revolution is the ability to collect unprecedented amounts of data. Real progress, however, depends on how efficiently we can &#226;&#128;&#152;extract value from chaos&#226;&#128;&#153;, i.e., process the collected data and transform it into useful information. Unfortunately, despite the impressive growth of data management technologies,  data analysis application efficiency is hindered by the increasing data growth. The typical business intelligence architecture is far too complex to yield answers productively, with businesses operating large numbers of specialized data processing systems, with data being repeatedly moved, copied or transformed between them. The reason is that, despite tremendous progress, data management tools are based on legacy designs whose requirements are no longer adequate. A novel approach is needed urgently, or users risk losing the ability to leverage their hard-earned data.
In this proposal, we identify assumptions that do not scale with today&#226;&#128;&#153;s massive data explosion, and design a comprehensive end-to-end solution that implements a novel form of data virtualization to vastly simplify data analysis. Our approach removes barriers to data handling and maximizes efficiency for science, businesses, and their users, by enabling new forms of data computation that are unrestrained by how data is collected or stored.

The importance of the evolution of vorticity in incompressible fluid mechanics is very well known.

To date, only nonrigorous approaches are known to try to obtain an evolution equation for isolated vortex lines. Two desingularization procedures are carried out (including a time renormalization) to obtain an evolution equation (the binormal equation). While an isolated vortex line does not fit any known concept of solution (given the singularity of the velocity), and there has been significant recent activity on the nonuniqueness of solutions of Euler (De Lellis &amp; Szekelyhidi, and recently Isett) it is expected that the geometric assumptions made about the solution will still make it possible to find a suitable concept of solution. In the proposal I describe an approach that should help to rigorously understand vortex lines. It is motivated by a programme developed for the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation with C. Fefferman and for some related desingularized models with my student Zoe Atkins (Nov 2012 PhD).

SQG has been of great interest in the PDE community due to the striking similarities it exhibits with 3D Euler. In particular, the evolution of sharp fronts for SQG corresponds to the evolution of vortex lines. In recent years I have developed an approach  that overcomes the divergences known to exist for the velocity field (as in 3D Euler). The positive results obtained for SQG motivate the methodology and tools described in the proposal, including the construction of solutions with very large gradients and simple geometry and the use of a measure-theoretic approach to identify fundamental curves within these objects. Surprising connections with other equations motivate some other directions and linked projects, for example with Prandtl and boundary layer ther theory.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,182,858</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="WII"><Rcn>188684</Rcn><Nid>9909</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Water, Ions, Interfaces: Quantum effects, charge and cooperativity in water, aqueous solutions and interfaces"</Name><PI>Sylvie Roke</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Sixty percent of the human body consists of water. Water provides the 3D-network for life&#226;&#128;&#153;s constituents. In a cell there are many interfaces: the average distance between two molecules or a molecule and a membrane interfaces is ~1 nm. Water and the interfaces it interacts with are of paramount importance for biological processes. The structural, dynamic, and biological properties of water, aqueous systems and aqueous interfaces are essential in understanding the complexity of life, and our ability to harness its features for novel technologies.
Waters&#226;&#128;&#153; 3D hydrogen bonded network is important for nearly all the macroscopic properties of water. The network is cooperative, yet it rearranges itself every few femtoseconds, and quantum level interactions determine its properties. Understanding the role water plays in living systems therefore requires information from the quantum level/femtosecond time scale up to the macroscopic level/time scale. Therefore, understanding water remains a considerable challenge.
I propose to investigate the structural, dynamic, and biological properties of water by probing the relationship between the properties of water on vastly different length and time scales. We will investigate quantum effects in water and on interfaces, and study long-range ordering (up from the femtosecond time scale). Furthermore, we will map how ions, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic solutes influence waters structural correlations and water-mediated interactions. Thus, we will use a worldwide unique multiscale toolbox that has for the most part been recently developed in my lab. We will map aqueous solutions by probing the structure of hydration shells, nanoscopic order and correlations between water molecules and viscosity.

Despite progress on coherent soft- and hard-x-ray pulsed sources during the last 10 years&#226;&#128;&#148;e.g. x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) or high-harmonic generation of laser light, nonlinear (e.g. 2D) spectroscopy or phase control of x-ray light remained a major challenge.

for the scientific goals
- (a) time- and quantum-state-resolved measurement of fundamental few- and many-electron dynamics
- (b) generation of soft-(electronic) and hard-x-ray (nuclear) frequency combs

For (a), a 4-quadrant x-ray time-delay unit will generate coherently-timed pulses out of one spatially coherent beam. For (b) a new physical mechanism relating Fano to Lorentz resonances and absorption to gain by a single temporal phase will be harvested.
Scientific impact:
(a): Site-specific 2D-x-ray spectroscopy will phase-sensitively test&amp;promote theory and allow to understand fundamental processes: excitation, ionization, and few-electron dynamics in atoms and molecular bonding orbitals.
(b): Impulsive phase control of resonant gain and absorption represents a disruptive key technology rivalling the LASER especially in the hard-x-ray domain, where long-lived population inversion in dense media seems impossible.

The fundamental nature of the models used is unprecedented and will represent a breakthrough compared to the more commonly applied statistical, correlative relationships. The methodology will focus on the intrinsic kinetics of (potentially) large-scale processes for the conversion of renewable feeds into fuels and chemicals. Non-ideal behaviour, caused by mass and heat transfer limitations or particular reactor hydrodynamics, will be explicitly accounted for when simulating or optimizing industrial-scale applications. The selected model reactions are situated in the area of biomass upgrading to fuels and chemicals: fast pyrolysis oil stabilization, glycerol hydrogenolysis and selective oxidation of (bio)ethanol to acetaldehyde.

For the first time, a systematic microkinetic modelling methodology will be developed for oxygenates conversion. In particular, stereochemistry in catalysis will be assessed. Two types of descriptors will be quantified: kinetic descriptors that are catalyst independent and catalyst descriptors that specifically account for the effect of the catalyst properties on the reaction kinetics. The latter will be optimized in terms of reactant conversion, product yield or selectivity. Fundamental relationships will be established between the catalyst descriptors as determined by microkinetic modelling and independently measured catalyst properties or synthesis parameters. These innovative relationships allow providing the desired, rational feedback in from optimal descriptor values towards synthesis parameters for a new catalyst generation.

It could, in principle, be the only planetary system in the Universe to harbor intelligent life or, indeed, life at all. As such, attempting to reconstruct its history is one of the most fundamental pursuits in the natural sciences. Whereas astronomical observations of star- forming regions provide a framework for understanding the formation of low-mass stars and the early evolution of planetary systems in general, direct information about the earliest solar system can only come from primitive meteorites and their components and some differentiated meteorites that record the birth of the solar system.

Our isotopic measurements will be obtained using state-of-the-art technologies such as second-generation mass spectrometers housed in laboratories directed by the PI and fully dedicated to cosmochemistry. This will allow us to: 1) define the mechanism and timescale for the collapse of the protosolar molecular cloud and emergence of the protoplanetary disk, 2) constrain the source and locale of chondrule-forming event(s) as well as the nature of the mechanism(s) required to transport chondrules to the accretion regions of chondrites, and 3) provide robust estimates of the timing and mechanism of asteroidal differentiation.

For example, mesoionic carbenes engage in bond activation processes via reversible hydrogen capture. Such cooperativity between the metal center and the ligand flattens the potential energy surface of a catalytic reaction and hence rises the competence of the catalyst, thus entailing higher turnover numbers as well as the conversion of more challenging substrates. Likewise, such cooperativity is expected to enhance the catalytic activity of metal centers that are typically not considered to be catalytically very active, such as the &#226;&#128;&#152;rusty&#226;&#128;&#153; first row transition metals (Mn, Fe, Ni). Surprisingly, however, this concept has largely been overlooked when designing catalytic transformations based on these earth-abundant and low-cost transition metals. This project will exploit the synergistic potential of mesoionic carbenes as synthetically highly versatile and actively supporting ligands to access a new generation of sustainable high-performance catalysts based on Me, Fe, and Ni for challenging redox transformations such as dehydrogenative oxidations. Specificlly, 1,2,3-triazolylidenes, which support ligand-metal cooperativity through their mesoionic character, will be utilized for (transient) storage/release of protons and electrons. Apart from enabling challenging transformations &#226;&#128;&#148; with obvious impact on synthetic methodology, energy conversion, and molecular electronics &#226;&#128;&#148; this project will break into new grounds in catalyst design that will be widely applicable as a new paradigm. Furthermore, this project will capitalize on the unique synthetic versatility of triazolylidene precursors and the opportunity to combine different functional entities such as carbohydrates, surfactants, or dyes with an organometallic entity, thus providing a straightforward approach to new classes of multifunctional materials for application in therapeutics and diagnostics, or as smart surfaces.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,111,111</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="15CBOOKTRADE"><Rcn>185561</Rcn><Nid>12345</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The 15th-century Book Trade: An Evidence-based Assessment and Visualization of the Distribution, Sale, and Reception of Books in the Renaissance</Name><PI>Cristina Dondi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The idea that underpins this project is to use the material evidence from thousands of surviving 15th-c. books, as well as unique documentary evidence &#226;&#128;&#148; the unpublished ledger of a Venetian bookseller in the 1480s which records the sale of 25,000 printed books with their prices &#226;&#128;&#148; to address four fundamental questions relating to the introduction of printing in the West which have so far eluded scholarship, partly because of lack of evidence, partly because of the lack of effective tools to deal with existing evidence.

Not only do they survive, but many of them bear stratified evidence of their history in the form of marks of ownership, prices, manuscript annotations, binding and decoration styles. A British Academy pilot project conceived by the PI produced a now internationally-used database which gathers together this kind of evidence for thousands of surviving 15th-c. printed books. For the first time, this makes it possible to track the circulation of books, their trade routes and later collecting, across Europe and the USA, and throughout the centuries. The objectives of this project are to examine (1) the distribution and trade-routes, national and international, of 15th-c. printed books, along with the identity of the buyers and users (private, institutional, religious, lay, female, male, and by profession) and their reading practices; (2) the books' contemporary market value; (3) the transmission and dissemination of the texts they contain, their survival and their loss (rebalancing potentially skewed scholarship); and (4) the circulation and re-use of the illustrations they contain. Finally, the project will experiment with the application of scientific visualization techniques to represent, geographically and chronologically, the movement of 15th-c. printed books and of the texts they contain.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,172</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADHESWITCHES"><Rcn>188664</Rcn><Nid>10637</Nid><HI>Turun Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Adhesion switches in cancer and development: from in vivo to synthetic biology</Name><PI>Mari Johanna Ivaska</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Integrins are transmembrane cell adhesion receptors controlling cell proliferation and migration.

Typically, transcription in leukemia cells is altered by the ectopic expression of transcription factors, by modulation of signaling pathways or by epigenetic changes. In addition to these factors that affect the production of RNAs, also changes in the processing of RNA (its splicing, transport and decay) may contribute to determine steady-state RNA levels in leukemia cells. Indeed, acquired mutations in various genes encoding RNA splice factors have recently been identified in myeloid leukemias and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia.

In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes.

With innovative approaches, molecules and ground-breaking hypothesis, this field of research can help understand several biological processes such as development, cancer and tissue degeneration. The project has 3 clear and ambitious objectives: 1. We propose to identify all the key genes mediating cell competition and their molecular mechanisms. In order to reach this objective we will use data from two whole genome screens in Drosophila where we have identified 7 key genes. By the end of this CoG grant, we should have no big gaps in our knowledge of how slow dividing cells are recognised and eliminated in Drosophila. 2. In addition, we will explore how general the cell competition pathways are and how they can impact biomedical research, with a focus in cancer and tissue degeneration. The interest in cancer is based on experiments in Drosophila and mice where we and others have found that an active process of cell selection determines tumour growth. Preliminary results suggest that the pathways identified do not only play important roles in the elimination of slow dividing cells, but also during cancer initiation and progression. 3. We will further explore the role of cell competition in neuronal selection, specially during neurodegeneration, development of the retina and adult brain regeneration in Drosophila. This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration. In this ERC CoG proposal, we are committed to continue our efforts from basic science to biomedical approaches. The phenomena of cell competition and its participating genes have the potential to discover novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies against cancer and tissue degeneration."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,968,062</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHAMELEON"><Rcn>191995</Rcn><Nid>11222</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>Cellular Hypoxia Alters DNA MEthylation through Loss of Epigenome OxidatioN</Name><PI>Diether Lambrechts</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA methylation was originally described in the 1970s as an epigenetic mark involved in transcriptional silencing, but the existence of DNA demethylation and the enzymes involved in this process were only recently discovered. In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis. Overall, we thus aim to establish the interplay between tumor hypoxia and the DNA methylome."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,920,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMATINREPAIRCODE"><Rcn>185661</Rcn><Nid>12025</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>CHROMATIN-REPAIR-CODE: Hacking the chromatin code for DNA repair</Name><PI>Haico Van Attikum</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our cells receive tens of thousands of different DNA lesions per day. Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#8217;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#8211; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="15CBOOKTRADE"><Rcn>185561</Rcn><Nid>12345</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The 15th-century Book Trade: An Evidence-based Assessment and Visualization of the Distribution, Sale, and Reception of Books in the Renaissance</Name><PI>Cristina Dondi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The idea that underpins this project is to use the material evidence from thousands of surviving 15th-c. books, as well as unique documentary evidence &#226;&#128;&#148; the unpublished ledger of a Venetian bookseller in the 1480s which records the sale of 25,000 printed books with their prices &#226;&#128;&#148; to address four fundamental questions relating to the introduction of printing in the West which have so far eluded scholarship, partly because of lack of evidence, partly because of the lack of effective tools to deal with existing evidence.

This proposal is of an interdisciplinary nature because it takes a basic cellular mechanism (the genetic pathways that select cells within tissues) and crosses boundaries between different fields of research: development, cancer, regeneration and tissue degeneration. In this ERC CoG proposal, we are committed to continue our efforts from basic science to biomedical approaches. The phenomena of cell competition and its participating genes have the potential to discover novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies against cancer and tissue degeneration."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,968,062</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHAMELEON"><Rcn>191995</Rcn><Nid>11222</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>Cellular Hypoxia Alters DNA MEthylation through Loss of Epigenome OxidatioN</Name><PI>Diether Lambrechts</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA methylation was originally described in the 1970s as an epigenetic mark involved in transcriptional silencing, but the existence of DNA demethylation and the enzymes involved in this process were only recently discovered. In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis. Overall, we thus aim to establish the interplay between tumor hypoxia and the DNA methylome."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,920,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMATINREPAIRCODE"><Rcn>185661</Rcn><Nid>12025</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>CHROMATIN-REPAIR-CODE: Hacking the chromatin code for DNA repair</Name><PI>Haico Van Attikum</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our cells receive tens of thousands of different DNA lesions per day. Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#226;&#128;&#153;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#226;&#128;&#153;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation.

Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#226;&#128;&#153;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DARK"><Rcn>185621</Rcn><Nid>12329</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Dark matter of the human transcriptome: Functional study of the antisense Long Noncoding RNAs and Molecular Mechanisms of Action</Name><PI>Antonin Morillon</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"98% of the human genome is non-protein coding raising the question of the role of the dark matter of the genome. It is now admitted that pervasive transcription generates thousands of noncoding transcripts that regulate gene expression and have broad impacts on development and disease. Among the long non coding (lnc)RNAs, antisense transcripts have been poorly studied despite their putative regulatory importance. Several functional examples include X-chromosome inactivation, maintenance of pluripotency and transcriptional regulation. However, no systematic study has yet addressed the comprehensive functional description of human antisense ncRNA, mainly because of technological issues and their low abundance. Indeed, in budding yeast S. cerevisiae, our group showed the existence of an entire class of antisense regulatory lncRNA extremely sensitive to RNA decay pathways, impinging their study so far. The roles for yeast antisense lncRNAs in shaping the epigenome raises important questions: What are the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which antisense lncRNAs carry out their functions and are they functionally conserved in human cells? We propose that the dark side of the non-coding genome is another layer of gene regulation complexity that needs to be deciphered.
With this proposal, we aim to draw the first exhaustive catalog of human antisense lncRNA in various cell types and tissues using up to date High throughput technologies and bioinformatics pipelines. Second, we propose to determine the functional role of antisense lncRNA on genome expression and stability in the context of cellular stress and cancer. We anticipate that powerful and modern genetic tools such DNA-mediated gene inactivation (ASO) and TALEN approaches will allow precise antisense genes manipulation never achieved so far. Our project is strongly supported by preliminary data indicating an unexpected large number of hidden antisense lncRNA in human cells controlled by RNA decay pathways."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,884</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DDRegulation"><Rcn>185624</Rcn><Nid>10732</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Regulation of DNA damage responses at the replication fork</Name><PI>Niels Mailand</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims at delineating the regulatory signaling processes that enable cells to overcome DNA damage during DNA replication, a major challenge to the integrity of the genome as the normal replication machinery is unable to replicate past DNA lesions. This may result in collapse of the replication fork, potentially giving rise to gross genomic alterations. To mitigate this threat, all cells have evolved DNA damage bypass strategies such as translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), involving low fidelity DNA polymerases that can replicate damaged DNA, albeit in an error-prone manner, offering a trade-off between limited mutagenesis and gross chromosomal instability. How DNA damage bypass pathways are regulated and integrated with DNA replication and repair remain poorly resolved questions fundamental to understanding genome stability maintenance and disease onset. Regulatory signaling mediated by the small modifier protein ubiquitin has a prominent role in orchestrating the reorganization of the replication fork necessary for overcoming DNA lesions, but this involvement has not been systematically explored. To remedy these gaps in our knowledge, I propose to implement a series of innovative complementary strategies to isolate and identify the regulatory factors and ubiquitin-dependent processes that promote DNA damage responses at the replication fork, allowing for subsequent in-depth characterization of their roles in protecting genome integrity by targeted functional studies. This project will enable an advanced level of mechanistic insight into key regulatory processes underlying replication-associated DNA damage responses that has not been feasible to achieve with exisiting methodologies, providing a realistic outlook for groundbreaking discoveries that will open up many new avenues for further research into mechanisms and biological functions of regulatory signaling processes in the DNA damage response and beyond.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,356</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DEEPINSIGHT"><Rcn>192498</Rcn><Nid>13420</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Preclinical micro-endoscopy in tumors: targeting metastatic intravasation and resistance</Name><PI>Peter Friedl</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Poor prognosis of cancer results from two central progression events, (i) the intravasation of cancer cells into blood vessels which leads to metastasis to distant organs and ultimately lethal tumor overload and (ii) cancer cell survival and adaptation to metabolic stress which causes resistance to anti-cancer therapy and limits life expectancy.

The hard- and software of the microendoscope will be optimized for automated position control and panoramic rotation to sample large tissue volumes and validated for stability and safety.

Axon loss not only sculpts neuronal networks in development, but also occurs early in numerous neurological diseases. Indeed, the life-time risk for diseases with an &#226;&#128;&#156;axonopathic&#226;&#128;&#157; component approaches 50%. Pathological axon loss likely involves aberrant activation of developmental programs &#226;&#128;&#147; just as cell death in disease often takes the form of apoptosis, another prominent regressive event in neural development. Over the past few years, the first molecular pathways have emerged for one form of axon loss, Wallerian degeneration, which removes entire axon arbors after severing. However, Wallerian degeneration is of limited clinical significance &#226;&#128;&#147; because the axon is cut and hence incapacitated before it is lost &#226;&#128;&#147; and appears to play only minor roles in development. In contrast, &#226;&#128;&#156;non-Wallerian&#226;&#128;&#157; forms of axon loss that selectively remove individual &#226;&#128;&#156;aberrant&#226;&#128;&#157; branches dominate during development (&#226;&#128;&#156;axon branch loss&#226;&#128;&#157;). Due to the technical challenge of studying axon loss in the complex environment of the developing mammalian nervous system, the subcellular events that precede such non-Wallerian forms of axon branch loss are poorly understood, even though this phenomenon &#226;&#128;&#147; when pathologically reactivated &#226;&#128;&#147; likely contributes to axonal pathology in many neurological disorders. Over the past years, in parallel work on axon development and disease, my laboratory has devised functional imaging techniques that allow studying axon loss in vivo in the mammalian peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) with subcellular resolution and molecular read-outs. Using these unique tools, I will address the following aims:

1 - Axon-intrinsic mechanisms of motor axon branch loss.
2 - Axon-glial mechanisms of motor axon branch loss.
3 - Axon branch loss during CNS development.
4 - Axon branch loss after CNS injury.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIRECT"><Rcn>185650</Rcn><Nid>11384</Nid><HI>Universiteit Maastricht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Disabling Radiotherapy resistance in Cancer Treatment</Name><PI>Marc Antoine Gijsbert Gilles Vooijs</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cancer is a devastating disease affecting 1 in 3 people in their lifetime. The incidence is rising because of our aging population and causes a huge economic impact on our society because of hospitalization and lost productivity. Radiotherapy alone or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy is used in ~50% of all patients and uses ionizing radiation to induce DNA breaks that are lethal to cells. While significant progress has been made, radiotherapy is often limited because of side-effects in normal tissues and tumor control often fails because of resistance and metastases. Novel treatment paradigms are urgently needed. Among the key classical biological factors that determine radiation response in normal and tumor cells are the 4R; Reoxygenation, Repopulation, Redistribution and Repair. They are determined by intrinsic (genetic) as well as extrinsic factors from the tumor microenvironment and underlie tumor heterogeneity a hallmark of cancers and a decisive factor in clinical response. Yet, standard cancer treatments are largely based on the flawed assumption that tumors are homogenous within and between patients. We hypothesized that NOTCH signaling and tumor hypoxia cause tumor heterogeneity and are tumor selective therapeutic targets. First we will study key biological mechanisms that determine intra tumor heterogeneity, second we will establish their role in therapy response and third we will exploit this knowledge to enhance radiotherapy and provide proof of concept of a highly innovative approach to selectively activate cancer therapeutics targeting the NOTCH stem cell pathway in therapy resistant tumor cells without adverse effects in normal tissues.

Somatic cell reprogramming is overcoming this limitation through the derivation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can be differentiated into disease-relevant cell-types. Despite these tantalizing possibilities, there are critical issues to be addressed in order to secure iPSC-modeling as a robust platform for the interrogation of disease aetiology and the development of new therapies. These concern the taming of human genetic variation, the identification of differentiation stages in which to uncover and validate phenotypes, and finally their translational into drug discovery assays. This project confronts these challenges focusing on the paradigmatic case of two rare but uniquely informative disorders caused by symmetric gene dosage imbalances at 7q11.23: Williams Beuren Syndrome and the subset of autism spectrum disorders associated to 7q11.23 microduplication. The hallmark of WBS is a unique behavioral-cognitive profile characterized by hypersociability and intellectual disability in the face of comparatively well-preserved language abilities. Hence, the striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between WBS and 7dupASD points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage-sensitive genes affecting social behaviour and cognition. We build on a large panel of iPSC lines that we already reprogrammed from a unique cohort of WBS and 7dupASD patients and whose characterization points to specific derangements at the level of transcriptional/epigenetic control, protein synthesis and synaptic dysfunction. Through the integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling with targeted mass spectrometry and gene network prediction we propose an innovative drug discovery pipeline for the identification of new therapeutic leads.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,804</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DNAMEREP"><Rcn>185551</Rcn><Nid>12349</Nid><HI>Ifom Fondazione Istituto Firc Di Oncologia Molecolare, Italy</HI><Name>The role of essential DNA metabolism genes in vertebrate chromosome replication</Name><PI>Vincenzo Costanzo</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Faithful chromosomal DNA replication is essential to maintain genome stability. A number of DNA metabolism genes are involved at different levels in DNA replication. These factors are thought to facilitate the establishment of replication origins, assist the replication of chromatin regions with repetitive DNA, coordinate the repair of DNA molecules resulting from aberrant DNA replication events or protect replication forks in the presence of DNA lesions that impair their progression. Some DNA metabolism genes are present mainly in higher eukaryotes, suggesting the existence of more complex repair and replication mechanisms in organisms with complex genomes. The impact on cell survival of many DNA metabolism genes has so far precluded in depth molecular analysis. The use of cell free extracts able to recapitulate cell cycle events might help overcoming survival issues and facilitate these studies. The Xenopus laevis egg cell free extract represents an ideal system to study replication-associated functions of essential genes in vertebrate organisms. We will take advantage of this system together with innovative imaging and proteomic based experimental approaches that we are currently developing to characterize the molecular function of some essential DNA metabolism genes. In particular, we will characterize DNA metabolism genes involved in the assembly and distribution of replication origins in vertebrate cells, elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the role of essential homologous recombination and fork protection proteins in chromosomal DNA replication, and finally identify and characterize factors required for faithful replication of specific vertebrate genomic regions.

By combining transgenic Drosophila lines carrying secreted fluorescent proteins to monitor the barrier function
in vivo with a genome-wide siRNA screen we will establish a unique system to directly identify gene

primary podocyte cultures originating from transgenic mice that are TORC1 deficient, TORC2 deficient or
TORC1 hyperactive (TSC1 KO) solely in the podocytes.

reverse the disease process (by repopulating lost podocytes), we invented a strategy to quantitatively monitor
podocyte turnover from different stem cell niches allowing us to precisely assess and potentially

The most common known cause is expansion of a GGGGCC repeat in the first intron of the gene C9orf72.

DPR aggregates outnumber the previously identified TDP-43 inclusions in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum. Some patients exclusively show DPR pathology, strongly suggesting DPR production is a key pathomechanism in C9orf72 mutation carriers.  However, we know next to nothing about the mechanisms of translation, toxicity, aggregation and clearance of DPR proteins. With this grant I will characterize this unusual pathomechanism in detail.

There are few efficient anti-inflammatory drugs to treat chronic inflammation and thus, there is an urgent need to validate novel targets. We now know that innate immunity is the main coordinator and driver of inflammation. Recently, we and others have shown that the activation of purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) in immune cells is a novel and increasingly validated pathway to initiate inflammation through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of IL-1&#206;&#178; and IL-18 cytokines. However, how NLRP3 sense P2X7R activation is not fully understood. Furthermore, extracellular ATP, the physiological P2X7R agonist, is a crucial danger signal released by injured cells, and one of the most important mediators of infection-free inflammation. We have also identified novel signalling roles for P2X7R independent on the NLRP3 inflammasome, including the release of proteases or inflammatory lipids. Therefore, P2X7R has generated increasing interest as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases, being drug like P2X7R antagonist in clinical trials to treat inflammatory diseases. However, it is often questioned the functionality of P2X7R in vivo, where it is thought that extracellular ATP levels are below the threshold to activate P2X7R. The overall significance of this proposal relays to elucidate how extracellular ATP controls host-defence in vivo, ultimately depicting P2X7R signalling through and beyond inflammasome activation. We foresee that our results will generate a leading innovative knowledge about in vivo extracellular ATP signalling during the host response to infection and sterile danger.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,794,948</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ENDOFUN"><Rcn>185622</Rcn><Nid>10734</Nid><HI>Universite De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>The endodermis- unraveling the function of an ancient barrier</Name><PI>Niko Geldner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"In addition to maintaining homeostasis within their cells, multicellular organisms also need to control their inner, extracellular spaces between cells. In order to do so, epithelia have developed, bearing ring-like paracellular barriers, with specialised membrane surfaces facing either the environment or the inner space of the organism. In animals, such polarised epithelia use specialised protein assemblies, called tight junctions, to seal the extracellular space, which have been a topic of active research for decades. Plant roots need to extract inorganic elements from the soil. A plethora of transporters are expressed in plant roots, yet, as in animals, transporter action is contingent upon the presence of efficient paracellular (apoplastic) barriers. Therefore, an understanding of the development, structure and function of the root apoplastic barrier is crucial for mechanistic models of root nutrient uptake. The endodermis is the main apoplastic barrier in roots, but, in contrast to animals, molecular data about endodermal differentiation and function has been virtually absent. We recently gained insights into the factors that drive endodermal differentiation, largely due to efforts from my research team. Our work has led a foundation of mutants, markers and protocols that provide an unprecented opportunity to test the many supposed roles of the root endodermis. Our preliminary insights indicate that generally accepted views of endodermal function have been overly simplistic. The topic of this proposal is to develop better tools and much more precise molecular analysis of nutrient uptake, centered around the endodermis. I propose to investigate our specific barrier mutants with new tools that allow visualisation of changes in nutrient transport at cellular resolution. The results from this project will provide a new foundation for models of plant nutrition and help us to understand how plants manage, and sometimes fail, to extract what they need from the soil."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,985,443</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EVOCOGN"><Rcn>185630</Rcn><Nid>11380</Nid><HI>The University Of Exeter, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Evolution of Cognitive Performance</Name><PI>Joah Madden</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"I aim to determine how cognitive abilities evolve under natural selection; one of the most important, yet poorly understood issues in modern biology. Comparative studies inform us how species differ, and hence, one can infer selective pressures. However, studies of how heritable inter-individual cognitive differences determine fitness in the face of natural selection are absent. I will use methods and paradigms developed in comparative psychology, cognitive science and behavioural ecology, applying them to free-living animals, and so determine how cognition evolves. Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) present an ideal system. Large numbers (100s) of individuals can be reared under controlled conditions and then exposed to natural selection pressures. Precocial chicks can be reared without differences in parental care. During rearing, chicks will complete a suite of automated cognitive training and testing, and their performance will be recorded. Conditions before and during rearing will be manipulated including maternal investment in eggs and diet complexity during rearing. Crucially, these captive reared birds will be released and exposed to natural selection. Surviving birds will be recaptured and bred from, producing large broods so that heritability can be studied. Empirical work will describe how individuals vary in their performance across a suite of cognitive domains; how such performance links to their natural behaviours; how their performance contributes to their fitness; how variation in performance is inherited; and how variation in performance is influenced by early life maternal or environmental factors. These are all significant steps in themselves, but the real strength of this project is addressing them in synchrony in a single, free-living study system. This provides a robust framework to tackle the broad question of how cognitive performance evolves that can be applied across a wider suite of conditions and taxa, including humans."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,450,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EVOLECOCOG"><Rcn>192566</Rcn><Nid>13444</Nid><HI>University College Cork, National University Of Ireland, Cork, Ireland</HI><Name>The evolutionary ecology of cognition across a heterogeneous landscape</Name><PI>John Leo Quinn</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Why do individuals vary in their cognitive abilities? This proposal takes the disciplines of cognition and evolutionary biology into a natural setting to answer this question by investigating a variety of proximate causes and population-level consequences of individual variation in cognitive ability.

State of the art observational (remote sensing and automated self-administration trials of learning in the wild), chemical (stable isotope analysis of diet), physiological (stress, energetics, immunocompetence), molecular (DNA fingerprinting and metabarcoding) and analytical (reaction norm, quantitative genetic) techniques will be used.

Quantitative genetic, social, parasite-mediated, and physiological causes will be explored. 2) To examine links between these traits, and key behaviours and trade-offs, e.g., space use, niche specialization, predation, parental care and promiscuity; and 3) To examine the consequences of this variation for life histories and fitness. The research team consists of the PI, five early career biologists, and three PhD students, and will collaborate with eight researchers from Europe and further afield.

In order to further enhance the evolutionary comparison of molecular sequences, this project will develop a complementary approach, the use of large complex similarity networks (typically a few million nodes and tens of millions of edges), adapted to evolutionary biology questions. Such networks, inspired by the studies on social and regulatory networks, are only currently studied by a limited number of research teams. They allow for fast inclusive comparative analyses of both (highly) divergent and conserved sequences, fully or partly similar. This project will consist in developing similarity networks to (i) identify and study chimeric genes and genomes, (ii) detect and analyze the common genetic goods shared between gene families and within microbial communities, (iii) test whether genetic diversity in environmental sequences is significantly larger, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than genetic diversity in the gene families of cultured organisms (and their MGE), (iv) improve the statistical framework to compare similarity networks.

What are the genetic mechanisms underlying neural circuit evolution? The project addresses this fundamental question in the Drosophila olfactory system, a superior ""evo-neuro"" model for several reasons: (i) as in mammals, the Drosophila olfactory system has a modular organization, with individual olfactory receptors functionally and anatomically defining discrete sensory circuits that can be traced from the periphery to the brain; (ii) these circuits are dynamically evolving, with frequent acquisition (and loss) of receptors, olfactory neurons and odor-evoked behaviors with the ever-changing landscape of environmental volatiles; (iii) Drosophila offers unparalleled experimental accessibility to visualize and manipulate neural circuits; (iv) a wealth of insect genomes permits comparative studies to relate intra- and interspecific genotypic and phenotypic variation.

Our lab has recently developed new methods to study by lineage tracing the cellular hierarchy that sustains homeostasis and repair of the epidermis and to identify distinct populations of SCs and progenitors ensuring mammary gland and prostate postnatal development.

While quantitative clonal analysis combined with mathematical modeling has been used recently to decipher the cellular basis of tissue homeostasis, such experimental approaches have never been used so far in mammals to investigate the cellular hierarchy acting during tissue expansion such as postnatal development and tissue repair.

In this project, we will use a multi-disciplinary approach combining mouse genetic lineage tracing and clonal analysis, mathematical modeling, proliferation kinetics, transcriptional profiling, and functional experiments to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating tissue expansion during epithelial development and tissue repair and how the fate of these cells is controlled during this process.

1. We will define the clonal and proliferation dynamics of tissue expansion in the epidermis, the mammary gland and the prostate during postnatal growth and adult tissue regeneration.
2. We will define the clonal and proliferation dynamics of tissue expansion in the adult epidermis following wounding and mechanical force mediated tissue expansion.
3. We will define the mechanisms that regulate the switch from multipotent to unipotent cell fate during development of glandular epithelia.

Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tissue growth and expansion during development and how these mechanisms differ from tissue regeneration in adult may have important implications for understanding the causes of certain developmental defects and for regenerative medicine.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,400,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EpiMechanism"><Rcn>188671</Rcn><Nid>13164</Nid><HI>Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, Portugal</HI><Name>Mechanisms of Chromatin-based Epigenetic Inheritance</Name><PI>Lars Jansen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Epigenetic mechanisms heritably maintain gene expression states and chromosome organization across cell division. These include chromatin-based factors that are propagated independent of local DNA sequence elements, and are critical for normal development and prevent reprogramming, e.g. during induction of pluripotency. We focus on the role of nucleosomes, the histone-DNA complexes that make up chromatin. While prominently implicated in epigenetic memory, how histones and their local modifications can actually be inherited is largely unknown. We take aim at three fundamental aspects that we argue are central to this problem: stability of the epigenetic mark, self-templated duplication, and cell cycle coupling.
We developed a unique pulse-labeling strategy to determine whether silent and active chromatin can be inherited and how this relates to transcription, both in cancer cells and in vitro differentiating stem cells. By coupling this strategy to an imaging-based RNAi screen we aim to identify components controlling nucleosome assembly and heritability. We achieve this by focusing on the human centromere, the chromosome locus essential for chromosome segregation which serves as an ideal model for epigenetic memory. This locus is specified by nucleosomes carrying the histone H3 variant, CENP-A that we have previously shown to be highly stable in cycling cells and to be replicated in a strict cell cycle coupled manner. We build on our previous successes to uncover the molecular mechanism and cellular consequences of the coupling between CENP-A propagation and the cell cycle which we postulate, ensures proper centromere size and mitotic fidelity. Furthermore, by genome engineering we developed a strategy to delete an endogenous centromere to determine how centromeres can form de novo and how CENP-A chromatin, once formed, can template its own duplication. With this multi-facetted approach we aim to uncover general mechanistic principles of chromatin-based memory.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,621,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EpiREPRO"><Rcn>188681</Rcn><Nid>12223</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Epigenetic Control of Mammalian Reproduction</Name><PI>D&#195;&#169;borah Bourc'his</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>By standing at the crossroads of generations, germ cells ensure species continuity. At the time of fertilization, the oocyte and spermatozoon carry the genetic material but also non-genetically encoded, epigenetic information. Gametic epigenetic modifications have immediate effects on gametic production and fertility. They also have long-term consequences on somatic phenotypes when transmitted to the progeny. Our team has previously made some important contributions to the emergence of these concepts. Here we propose to explore further the epigenetic control of mammalian reproduction, with a specific emphasis on DNA methylation-related events. How are DNA methylation patterns shaped? How do they impact on germ cell identity and integrity? How much gametic DNA methylation is transmitted to the progeny and how does this influence phenotypes across generations?
Our projects can be subdivided into three interconnected themes, which are at the heart of mammalian developmental biology and are not usually investigated as a common effort: 1) Trans and cis determinants of de novo DNA methylation, 2) DNA methylation and transposon control, and 3) DNA methylation and genomic imprinting. Our approach is mainly fundamental, using the mouse as a mammalian model, and will involve a powerful combination of genetics, cellular and developmental biology, with large-scale genomic and biochemical strategies. We are also extending our research to humans, in the hope of uncovering new causes of impaired or malignant gametogenesis. Correct DNA methylation patterns are paramount for the generation of functional gametes capable of forming viable and healthy offspring, but also for the regulation of pluripotency states and the maintenance of genome architecture and function in somatic cells. Our work therefore not only impacts on the field of reproduction and development, but also on stem cell biology and cancer.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,416</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EvoGeneticsTFBinding"><Rcn>185597</Rcn><Nid>11368</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Evolutionary genetics of transcription factor binding in closely related mammals</Name><PI>Duncan T Odom</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The genetic differences found in gene regulatory regions are the largest contributing factor to the diversity of phenotypes within and between mammalian species. However, the micro-evolutionary mechanisms active in closely-related species remain poorly explored, particularly in mammals.
In Aim 1, we will exploit five recently sequenced mouse species to determine how often genetic sequence differences alter both the genome-wide binding and regulatory output of a core set of tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) known to act combinatorially in liver. This project aim will establish the micro-evolutionary processes that drive interspecies changes in transcriptional regulation.
In Aim 2, we will create first-generation intercrosses of a subset of these mouse species to dissect the cis and trans contributions to TF binding differences between species, and to explore the functional implications for nearby chromatin and gene expression. This aim will also establish whether any tissue-specific TF binding sites show parent-of-chromosomal origin effects.
In Aim 3, we will use classically generated TF knockout mice to identify a set of functionally enriched TF binding sites, which will be further categorized by their conservation across the five mouse species. Then, using the revolutionary ability to rapidly and precisely delete individual binding sites (as well as combinations of binding sites) in the mouse genome by zinc finger nucleases, we will test whether conservation of these protein-DNA contacts can predict functional activity at target genes.
This integrated approach combines the comparison of TF binding in closely-related mammals with powerful new experimental tools to afford a comprehensive understanding of the genetics and mechanisms underlying the micro-evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,910,107</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EvolRecombAdapt"><Rcn>189843</Rcn><Nid>11809</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Recombination in Adaptive Evolution</Name><PI>Felicity Clare Jones</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Meiotic recombination is a key source of genetic diversity with considerable implications for the genomic landscape and evolutionary process. By shuffling parental alleles to produce novel haplotypes, recombination impacts the strength of selection on nearby polymorphisms, and can increase the rate of adaptation in natural populations. Recombination defects can have serious phenotypic consequences: inviable gametes, miscarriages and developmental abnormalities. Strikingly, recombination rate differs by orders of magnitude across the genome, among individuals, sexes, populations and species. Despite recent progress, we know little about how molecular constraints and evolutionary forces interact to shape recombination in natural populations. We will close this knowledge gap using threespine stickleback fish&#226;&#128;&#148;an exceptional evolutionary model system that bridges molecular genetic studies and adaptive evolution in the wild. This research program combines next-generation genomics with cutting-edge molecular biology and transgenics. We will 1) create kilobase-scale maps of the recombination landscape in adaptively diverging populations; 2) genetically dissect factors cis- and trans-acting factors that cause recombination variation; 3) characterize molecular mechanisms of recombination modifiers using cutting-edge techniques; and 4) test evolutionary theory that predicts natural selection favours recombination suppression in hybrids. This will significantly improve our understanding of recombination and introduce sophisticated genetic engineering techniques that further cement sticklebacks as an evolutionary model organism.

Several thousands of stimulation runs performed in several hundreds of patients will be included in the atlas database to reach a nearly full coverage of the human cortex (inclusion of 540 patients retrospectively and of 172 patients/year prospectively, from 8 French and 1 Czech epilepsy surgery centres).

Since tumor infiltrating Tregs can display function heterogeneity, depending on both the tumor type and the inflammatory milieu, only inhibition of the right Treg activity should result in the unleash of an effective anti-tumor T cell responses. Experimental plan: To identify the Tregs that truly inhibit anti-tumor T cells, we will profile by RNA-Seq the transcriptome of Tregs infiltrating both tumor and healthy tissues. In particular, we will focus on LncRNAs and the gene networks they modulate, since they have recently emerged as relevant epigenetic regulators of cell differentiation and identity. We will exploit this new knowledge to create a panel of regulatory transcripts, which will be assessed at single cell level on tumor infiltrating Tregs, so to determine the association of specific transcripts with different Treg populations. Since downregulation of specific lncRNAs might be an efficient way to inhibit the &#226;&#128;&#156;unwanted&#226;&#128;&#157; Tregs at tumor sites, we aim at targeting lncRNAs uniquely expressed in these Tregs and propose to develop AsiCs, chimeric molecules composed by an aptamer, single stranded oligonucleotides that bind to cell surface markers, and a siRNA, short RNAs downregulating specific lncRNAs. Deliverables and conclusions: this proposal will provide new knowledge on tumor infiltrating Tregs possibly allowing definition of molecular signatures of Tregs with either positive or negative effects on antitumor T cell responses. Moreover, we will develop new molecules that specifically target lncRNAs of interest and that will help identifying new antitumor therapeutic targets. In conclusion, the possibility to modulate Tregs effector functions may not only offer new anti-tumor therapy but more in general may be relevant to any immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GENEREGULATION"><Rcn>185550</Rcn><Nid>11979</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Deciphering the code of gene regulation using massively parallel assays of designed sequence libraries</Name><PI>Eran Segal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Many gene expression changes that are associated with disease states have in turn been linked to changes in the genes&#226;&#128;&#153; regulatory regions. However, without a &#226;&#128;&#152;regulatory code&#226;&#128;&#153; that informs us how DNA sequences determine expression levels, we cannot predict which sequence changes will affect expression, by how much, and by what mechanism.

Here, we aim to arrive at a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of how expression levels are encoded in DNA sequence using a combined experimental and computational approach. To this end, we will construct libraries of &gt;50,000 sequences, fuse them to fluorescent reporters, and genomically integrate them to yeast or human cells. We will then develop methods for accurately measuring, in parallel, the expression of each fused sequence within a single experiment, and for measuring the DNA binding state of each sequence at single cell resolution, resulting in ~1000-fold increase in the scale with which we can study the effect of sequence on expression.

Notably, we will design our experimental system to be modular, allowing us to propose a highly ambitious yet realistic plan in which we will study the effect of sequence on (1) transcriptional and (2) post-transcriptional regulation; (3) Unravel the effect of genetic variation across human individuals on expression; (4) Quantify how cellular fitness depends on the expression level of individual endogenous genes; and (5) Construct a predictive model of the effect of DNA sequence on expression.

Each of our libraries should provide novel insights into a different aspect of gene regulation, leading to new means by which we can interpret whole genome sequencing, which is rapidly being collected for many individuals. In particular, our unified model should allow us to predict expression changes among human individuals based only on their genotypic variation, greatly enhancing the ability to identify common or rare sequence variants that may affect molecular function or cause disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GlycoTarget"><Rcn>185647</Rcn><Nid>12320</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>Exploring the targeted delivery of biopharmaceuticals enabled by glycosylation control</Name><PI>Nico Luc Marc Callewaert</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Most biotechnological therapeutics used in the clinic today and under current development, are of protein nature. Eukaryotic expression systems (such as yeasts and mammalian cells) for these therapeutic proteins add carbohydrate moieties (glycans) to the proteins, and these glycans strongly modulate the protein's in vivo biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy. Until recently, no adequate tools were available to accurately control glycosylation structure in these expression systems, but bio-engineering research in our lab and elsewhere has now largely overcome this problem.
In the GlycoTarget ERC Consolidator grant project, we aim at exploring the relation between the structure of the glycans on therapeutic proteins and the in vivo targeting properties of these modified proteins to different tissues/cells/subcellular organelles.
As highly medically relevant test cases for this exploration, we have selected three diseases with strong unmet therapeutic need, that could potentially be treated with glyco-targeted biopharmaceuticals through three different routes of protein delivery: progressive liver disease (intravenous), allergic asthma (subcutaneous immunization) and active tuberculosis (intrapulmonary delivery).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,760</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GreenProteases"><Rcn>189827</Rcn><Nid>11818</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Proteolytic Machinery of the Plant Apoplast: from Basic Understanding to Improved Recombinant Protein Production</Name><PI>Renier Adrianus Leonardus Van Der Hoorn</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The plant proteolytic machinery involves over 700 proteases that control the (in)activation of proteins. Surprisingly, although every protein is regulated by proteolysis, only very few natural substrates of plant proteases have been identified, and the diverse roles of e.g. secreted proteases are still poorly understood. These questions have become even more urgent since glyco-engineered plants are increasingly used for the production of recombinant proteins (RPs) to produce therapeutic antibodies, enzymes and hormones. Notably, transient expression by infiltrating leaves with Agrobacterium cultures (agroinfiltration) is cheaper, safer, more scalable and faster than any other protein expression system. However, glycosylated RPs are secreted into the apoplast where they are cleaved and degraded by plant proteases, many of which accumulate upon agroinfiltration. Therefore, secreted plant proteases cause heavy yield losses and obstruct the true potential of molecular farming in plants.

The aim of this project is to comprehensively understand the roles of proteases in the plant apoplast and to use this knowledge to improve recombinant (glyco)protein production in plants by targeted protease depletion.

To achieve this aim, my four objectives are to:
1) identify the major apoplastic proteases and their natural substrates and unravel proteolytic pathways;
2) annotate biological roles to secreted proteases in cellular homeostasis and microbial colonization;
3) understand substrate selection and develop software to predict cleavage sites in apoplastic substrates;

Remarkably, driver mutations of the histone H3.3 variant and its loading machinery have been recently found in paediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a devastating neoplasm originating from transformed neural precursors. Thus, the very basic building blocks of chromatin can be mutated in cancer.
The present challenge is to define at which level altered H3.3 loading influences GBM pathogenesis and provide clues into the underlying mechanisms. Based on work from our group and others, we hypothesise that alterations of H3.3 function/deposition would lead to epigenetic changes, deregulated transcription at bivalent loci and other genomic regions, and alterations of telomere maintenance mechanisms, in turn contributing to tumourigenesis.

The main objectives of this proposal are to:
1. Examine the impact of H3.3 mutations on brain cancer pathogenesis, by determining the effect of mutant H3.3 expression on neural precursor cell transformation (A), and tumour maintenance (B).
2. Define the molecular changes caused by incorporation of H3.3 mutants into the genome and their involvement in tumourigenesis, by A. determining the genome-wide distribution of WT and mutant H3.3 proteins, B. identifying mutant H3.3-driven transcriptional and epigenetic changes, C. defining effects on telomere maintenance mechanisms, and D. connecting mutant H3.3-driven molecular changes to the biological phenotypes.

The discovery of mutations in histones and their loading machinery represents a paradigm change in the field of cancer epigenetics. We anticipate this study to provide key insights into the role of these alterations in chromatin regulation and cancer pathogenesis. More broadly, this work will increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing chromatin modification in mammalian cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HEALTHMPOWR"><Rcn>192003</Rcn><Nid>11184</Nid><HI>Folkehelseinstituttet, Norway</HI><Name>A New Paradigm for Public Health Surveillance: Unlocking the Potential of Data to Empower Women and Health Systems</Name><PI>Jahn Frederik Froen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Rationale: State of the art health registries, cornerstones of public health surveillance, have hardly capitalized on the information and communication technology revolution. Many continue to be static, fragmented, and passive data repositories disseminating outdated reports only to a closed loop of public health officials.
Aim: In a radical departure from traditional science, this proposal introduces a new paradigm for public health surveillance: Maximizing the potential of data by disseminating data-driven individualized real-time information directly to women and providers to empower self-care in pregnancy and better healthcare delivery.
Research question: Is routine, data-driven and automated feedback from a reproductive health registry (RHR) effective in improving health behaviour and quality of care?
Plan: Based on the roll-out of a RHR in the Palestinian West Bank, four stepped wedged cluster randomized controlled trials will be undertaken to investigate the comparative effectiveness of a series of feedback modules to women and care providers. Main outcomes include adherence to evidence-based guidelines for providers, and self-care and care seeking among women.
Impact: Coalescing with WHO/NIPH&#226;&#128;&#153;s dissemination of the harmonized Reproductive Health Registries (hRHR) Initiative, the scientific horizons emerging from this proposal have potential for exceptional impact.

New technologies are driving an explosion of high-dimensional datasets that will sustain a continuing need for new methods, theory and computationally efficient software.

The methods development will be driven by, and applied to, several cutting-edge datasets in the fields of human disease genetics, population genetics and plant and animal breeding, guaranteeing impact on exciting scientific questions.

The first part concerns a wide circle of ideas around haplotype estimation, genotype imputation and analysis of sequencing data. The overarching aim is to provide a suite of methods that can estimate haplotypes and impute genotypes in a unified and computationally efficient manner.  In addition, we will work to create a reference set of haplotypes from tens of thousands of European and worldwide samples that will form a central resource for human disease and population genetic studies.

The second part concerns the development of models for high-dimensional phenotypic data in genome-wide association studies.

G-4s have been found in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, while very little information is available on viruses. The applicant research group has recently shown that HIV-1, which integrates into the human chromosomes and exploits cellular factors to activate transcription, takes advantage of G-4-mediated transcription regulation. G-4 disruption stimulates promoter activity while G-4 stabilization by small molecules inhibits it, showing a striking parallelism between HIV-1 LTR and eukaryotic promoter G-4s. Preliminary results indicate that similar G-4 structures form also in the viral RNA genome before retrotranscription. Available G-4 ligands, developed as anticancer drugs targeting DNA G-4, recognize both viral and cellular G-4s. Therefore, they cannot be straightforwardly used as anti-HIV compounds. The aim of this project is to develop highly specific anti-HIV-1 drugs targeting LTR DNA and/or RNA G-4s, using both reversible G-4 ligands and G-4-selective alkylating/cleaving agents, triggered by external stimuli. These approaches will be taken: a) to increase selectivity by 1) screening of ligands against LTR G-4s to select the best hits among libraries of G-4 ligands; 2) conjugation of the most promising leads to modified nucleic acids complementing LTR G-4 loop/flanking regions, to deliver the drug to its target; b) to stabilize binding by conjugation of the ligands to 3) an alkylating/cleaving subunit, and 4) an activable moiety (such as quinone methides) that alkylates the target only once the drug has reached it. Physico-chemical, biomolecular, cellular and viral assays will be used to tests the compounds. This approach should deliver reversible and irreversible ligands that selectively inhibit viral transcription and/or reverse transcription, thus preventing virus production and/or integration into the host genome.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,989,471</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HMRI"><Rcn>191254</Rcn><Nid>10603</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Non-Invasive In-Vivo Histology in Health and Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</Name><PI>Nikolaus Weiskopf</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding of the normal and diseased brain crucially depends on reliable knowledge of its microstructure. Important functions are mediated by small cortical units (columns) and even small changes in the microstructure can cause debilitating diseases. So far, this microstructure can only be determined using invasive methods such as, e.g., ex-vivo histology. This limits neuroscience, clinical research and diagnosis.

My research vision is to develop novel methods for high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T-9.4T to reliably characterize and quantify the detailed microstructure of the human cortex.

This MRI-based histology will be used to investigate the cortical microstructure in health and focal cortical degeneration. Structure-function relationships in visual cortex will be elucidated in-vivo, particularly, ocular dominance columns and stripes. Specific microstructural changes in focal cortical degeneration due to Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease and monocular blindness will be determined, including amyloid plaque imaging.

To resolve the subtle structures and disease related changes, which have not previously been delineated in-vivo by anatomical MRI, unprecedented isotropic imaging resolution of up to 250 &#194;&#181;m is essential. Methods for high-resolution myelin and iron mapping will be developed from novel quantitative MRI approaches that I have previously established. Super-resolution diffusion and susceptibility imaging will be developed to capture the neuropil microstructure. Anatomical imaging will be complemented by advanced high-resolution functional MRI. The multi-modal MRI data will be integrated into a unified model of MRI contrasts, cortical anatomy and tissue microstructure.

My ambitious goal of developing in vivo MRI-based histology can only be achieved by an integrative approach combining innovations in MR physics, modelling and tailored (clinical) neuroscience experiments.

In the present project, we will continue working on the immune homeostasis of the gut and we will focus on fundamental questions in mucosal immunity.
Three important and novel questions will be addressed in this project. The first aims at understanding how the gut microbiota is restrained from reaching systemic sites and hence it is tolerated only locally. We think that we have identified a new barrier at mucosal sites that avoids systemic spreading of bacteria via the blood stream. This is a very selective barrier that resembles the blood brain barrier and occurs at the level of enteric endothelial cells. The second question is closely related and tries to identify the role of the microbiota in the establishment/maintenance of this barrier and to understand its role during infection with enteric pathogens or in other circumstances (like pregnancy, liver disease). Finally, we want to characterize the activity of an anti-inflammatory mediator that we have identified. This is a short isoform of the well-known cytokine called TSLP. We think that this isoform is the one involved in the homeostasis of the intestine as it is the only one produced by epithelial cells in health and is downregulated during chronic inflammation.
This project is divided into three major aims.
1. Analysis of a putative gut vascular barrier that resembles the blood brain barrier and of the mechanisms leading to its disruption
2. Analysis of the role of the microbiota in the formation and maintenance of the Gut vascular barrier (GVB).
3. Elucidation of the activity of TSLP short isoform.

LSDs are fatal diseases of childhood occurring in 1:5000-7000 live births; in &gt;50% of the cases, LSD patients experience a severe neurological deterioration. Most LSDs with central nervous system (CNS) involvement lack a curative treatment. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) form healthy donors is applied to LSD patients in order to repopulate the recipient myeloid compartment, including CNS microglia, with donor-derived cells expressing the defective functional hydrolase. Over the past three decades, about 1000 HCTs have been performed for patients with LSDs with a variable benefit exerted on the CNS. The positive results obtained in Hurler syndrome and few other LSDs and the benefit observed in our on going Phase I/II clinical trial of HSC gene therapy for the demyelinating LSD metachromatic leukodystrophy indicate that migration of the transplanted Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs)/their progeny into the affected human brain occurs. However, timing of resident CNS macrophages and microglia replacement by the transplanted cell progeny is frequently too slow for clinical benefit due to the rapid progression of the primary neurological disease, particularly in the most aggressive LSD variants. Thus, a deep understanding of the modalities, time course and factors that affect this phenomenon might allow enhancing clinical benefit of HSC-based approaches for treating the LSD brain disease. The proposed work, combining basic and innovative preclinical research with the information derived from a pioneering clinical experience, will generate the basis for designing more efficacious and safer transplant approaches for these fatal diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,751,147</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Hairy Cell Leukemia"><Rcn>191330</Rcn><Nid>10769</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Perugia, Italy</HI><Name>Genetics-driven targeted therapy of Hairy Cell Leukemia</Name><PI>Enrico Tiacci</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL),  a chronic B-cell neoplasm, is initially sensitive to chemotherapy with purine analogs, but ~40% of patients eventually relapses and becomes less responsive to these drugs. Furthermore, purine analogs may cause myelotoxicity, immune-suppression and severe opportunistic infections. Therefore, molecularly-targeted less toxic drugs are highly desirable in HCL. However, its low incidence and the initial efficacy of purine analogs has made HCL an orphan in the world of cancer research and has spoiled the academic and industrial interest in developing better treatments for this disease. But recently we identified the V600E activating mutation in the BRAF kinase as the key genetic lesion of HCL (similar to BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia). Orally available specific BRAF inhibitors (e.g., Vemurafenib) have in the meantime showed remarkable efficacy in melanoma patients harboring the BRAF-V600E mutation, although resistance to such drugs eventually develops in this malignancy through reactivation of MEK (the downstream target of BRAF). The ground-breaking objective of this project is to introduce for the first time in HCL, by means of phase-2 investigator-driven pilot clinical trials, the concept of BRAF and/or MEK inhibition as an oral, non chemotherapy-based, entirely out-patient, genetics-driven and rationally designed treatment strategy, first in patients with active disease despite (or severe toxicity from) previous chemotherapy with purine analogs, and then, potentially, in the frontline setting. In comparison to melanoma, deeper and longer effect of BRAF inhibition may be expected in HCL, due to its much lower genetic complexity and proliferation rate. Anyway, potential mechanisms of resistance will be searched for to identify other genes recurrently mutated or aberrantly expressed in HCL patients developing resistance to BRAF inhibition (if any), and the clinical feasibility of combined BRAF and MEK inhibition will be addressed.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HostingTOXO"><Rcn>188655</Rcn><Nid>12210</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Toxoplasma gondii secretes an armada of effector proteins to co-opt its host cell transcriptome and microRNome to promote sustained parasitism</Name><PI>Mohamed-Ali Hakimi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread obligate intracellular protozoan parasite causing toxoplasmosis, a severe disease in immunocompromised or congenitally infected humans. It can infect any type of nucleated cells and grow inside a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) from where it directs profound changes in their transcriptome, proteome and microRNome. During invasion and creation of the PV membrane, apically oriented organelles called micronemes and rhoptries are discharged, followed later by release of dense granules content (DG). Recent advances have highlighted few strain-specific parasite effectors released from the rhoptry into the host cells where they neutralize cell autonomous immunity defences or subvert the host cell transcriptome thereby governing the fate of immune response and disease outcomes. Considering the magnitude of the repertoire of mRNA- and microRNA-encoding genes that is differentially regulated in host cells, it seems certain that other critical rhoptry- and DG-resident proteins that interact with host signaling pathways await discovery. By integrating diverse genomic-scale analyses and using reverse genetic, we identify novel DG proteins that are singularly exported beyond the tachyzoites-hosting PV to the host cell nucleus, thus extending the scope of the function of DG proteins beyond their dedicated role in vacuole formation. This collection of novel parasite effectors will be invaluable towards our goal of understanding how T. gondii actively remodels the genome expression of its hosting cell with profound and coupled impact on both parasite developmental process and the host immune response. We propose i) to characterize thoroughly the function of novel effector proteins secreted by T. gondii and ii) to explore how their synergistic or antagonist effects on host gene regulation contribute to promote sustained parasitism. An original line of research will be dedicated to determine by which means T. gondii re-programs the host microRNome.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,968,644</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IR-DC"><Rcn>189826</Rcn><Nid>11819</Nid><HI>Fundacio Centre De Regulacio Genomica, Spain</HI><Name>Individual Robustness in Development and Cancer</Name><PI>Benjamin Lehner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Biological systems are robust to perturbations, with many genetic, stochastic and environmental challenges having no or little phenotypic consequence.  However, the extent of this robustness varies across individuals, for example the same mutation or treatment may only affect a subset of individuals.  The overall objective of this project is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that confer this robustness and why it varies across individuals.

We will address three specific questions:
1. Why do inherited mutations have different outcomes in different individuals, even when they are genetically identical and share a common environment?
2. What are the mechanisms during development that confer robustness to mechanical deformation?
3. How can the loss of robustness be exploited to specifically kill cancer cells?

To address the first two questions, we will use live imaging procedures that we have developed that make the C. elegans embryo a unique animal system to link early inter-individual variation in gene expression and cellular behaviour to later variation in phenotypes.  To address the third question, we will apply our understanding of genetic robustness and genetic interaction networks in model organisms to the comprehensive analysis of cancer genome datasets.  The predictions from these hypothesis-driven computational analyses will then be evaluated using wet-lab experiments.

Understanding and predicting variation in robustness is both a fundamental challenge for biology and one that is central to the development of personalised and predictive medicine. A patient does not want to know the typical outcome of a mutation or treatment; they want to know what will actually happen to them.  The work outlined here will contribute to our basic understanding of robustness and its variation among individuals, and it will also directly tackle the problem of predicting and targeting variation in robustness as a strategy to kill tumour cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,812</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InflaMet"><Rcn>185586</Rcn><Nid>11386</Nid><HI>Stichting Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut-Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis, Netherlands</HI><Name>Mechanistic insights into the impact of tumor-associated neutrophils on metastatic breast cancer</Name><PI>Karina Elizabeth De Visser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Metastatic disease is still largely unexplored, poorly understood and incurable. Accumulating evidence indicates that cells and mediators of the immune system can facilitate metastasis. Neutrophil accumulation in cancer patients has been associated with metastasis formation. In mouse tumor models, neutrophils have been reported to be pro- or anti- metastatic, but the underlying mechanisms involved in either function remain largely elusive. This proposal outlines a research program aimed at resolving the pro-metastatic role of neutrophils in breast cancer, as our preliminary data indicate that neutrophils proactively mediate breast cancer metastasis. Using a state-of-the art spontaneous breast cancer metastasis mouse model, we will mechanistically study how neutrophils facilitate metastasis formation and how mammary tumors provoke the metastasis-facilitating function of neutrophils. Building upon my previous studies and our current data, we will focus on the unexplored crosstalk between the adaptive immune system and neutrophils in facilitating spontaneous metastatic disease. These crucial questions will be addressed by undertaking a multidisciplinary approach, involving sophisticated mouse models for metastatic breast cancer, RNA sequencing on tumor-associated neutrophil populations, state-of-the-art mouse engineering, intravital imaging and in vivo neutrophil manipulations. Moreover, we will validate our findings from the mouse metastasis model in human breast cancer samples. We will determine the metastasis predicting power of the identified murine pro-metastatic neutrophil-specific pathways by immunohistochemistry and multi-parameter immunofluorescence on breast cancer samples and blood of untreated patients of which clinical follow-up is available. Thus, we will identify novel molecular pathways that can be targeted to selectively inhibit the pro-metastatic activity of the immune system.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,360</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InflammAct"><Rcn>191234</Rcn><Nid>11902</Nid><HI>Universitaetsklinikum Bonn, Germany</HI><Name>Activation and Regulation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome</Name><PI>Eicke Latz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The innate immune system protects the host from infections, detects and repairs tissue damage and functions to maintain tissue homeostasis. Several families of signaling receptors can recognize microbial substances or altered host molecules and orchestrate a coordinated inflammatory response. Inflammasomes are signaling platforms that control proteolytic activation of highly proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1&#206;&#178; family and thus, are relevant for infection control and numerous inflammatory conditions. In addition to recognizing foreign signals, the NLRP3 inflammasome can sense sterile tissue damage and various endogenous danger signals that appear in many common chronic inflammatory conditions. NLRP3 can be triggered by material released from dying cells and aggregated or crystalline substances, and its activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prevalent diseases in Western societies, such as type 2 diabetes, COPD, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by diverse signals however, the molecular mechanisms leading to its activation remain poorly understood. Using chemical biology screens and proteomics analysis, we identified that NLRP3 activity is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination. This project aims to identify the enzymes and signaling mechanisms leading to NLRP3 activation. In an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, we will employ chemical biology screening to identify novel targets that act to regulate NLRP3, and will describe the NLRP3 interactome in response to various triggers. Data obtained by these approaches will be analyzed by bioinformatics, and signaling mechanisms identified will be confirmed by RNA interference and gain-of-function studies. Utilizing a range of biochemical, biophysical and immunological techniques, we will determine the mechanisms by which the identified molecules can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and assess their physiological relevance in models of inflammation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,906</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IonDynDev"><Rcn>189850</Rcn><Nid>11804</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Ionic dynamics and plasticity in developing neuronal networks</Name><PI>Colin Jon Akerman</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Ionic gradients are a fundamental feature of the nervous system and its development. They are established by the actions of ion pumps, transporters and channel proteins that reside in the membrane of cells. And maintaining these gradients is a prerequisite for generating fluxes of ions, which in turn drive cellular processes. Ion regulatory mechanisms often differ between cell types and changes in intracellular ion concentration have been implicated in multiple processes in the developing brain, from proliferation, to process outgrowth and the refinement of synaptic circuits. One of the limitations however, has been the shortage of experimental tools for dissecting intracellular ion dynamics in the developing nervous system. Here I propose to capitalise upon methods we have developed for directly measuring and manipulating ion concentrations in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. The proposal focuses upon two key ions: chloride ions and hydrogen ions, which can exhibit intracellular changes over a range of timescales. Working in the neocortex of developing mice, optical reporters will be used to measure ion dynamics at key stages of mammalian brain development and light-activated proteins will be used to selectively control intracellular ion levels. The first series of experiments will investigate chloride and hydrogen ion dynamics in neuronal progenitor cells and relate this to cellular processes during cortical neurogenesis. We will then compare how developing neurons and astrocytes establish their ion gradients, as our data indicate that these two cell types possess different regulatory mechanisms. We will examine how emerging network activity influences ion dynamics and then selectively manipulate these dynamics to examine their contribution to synaptic development and ongoing network activity. The final series of experiments will examine whether developing neurons show homeostatic responses when their intracellular ion gradients are challenged.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,689,631</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LEARN2SEE"><Rcn>185638</Rcn><Nid>12019</Nid><HI>Scuola Internazionale Superiore Di Studi Avanzati Di Trieste, Italy</HI><Name>"Invariant visual object representations in the early postnatal and adult cortex: bridging theory, model and neurobiology"</Name><PI>Davide Franco Zoccolan</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our visual system can effortlessly recognize hundreds of thousands of objects in spite of tremendous variation in their appearance, resulting, for instance, from changes in object position and pose. Achieving such an invariant representation of the visual world is an extremely challenging computational problem that even the most advanced artificial vision systems are not fully able to solve. This is why understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying object vision is one of the major challenges of systems neuroscience and a crucial step towards developing artificial vision systems and visual prostheses.
Little is known yet about how the brain develops and maintains invariant object representations. The leading theory is that visual neurons exploit the spatiotemporal continuity of visual experience (i.e., the natural tendency of different object views to occur nearby in time) to learn to produce similar responses for temporally contiguous stimuli, so as to factorize object identity from other variables (such as position, size, etc.). This Unsupervised Temporal Learning (UTL) strategy has been instantiated in a number of computational frameworks, but its empirical investigation has received little attention. My proposal will use the visual system of the rat to address key questions about the nature of UTL and other learning theories, such as their impact on recognition behavior and object representations at both single-neuron and population level, and their role during early postnatal development. This will be achieved through a highly multidisciplinary approach, including high-throughput behavioral testing, in vivo neuronal recordings, immediate-early gene labeling, controlled-rearing in virtual visual environments, and computational modeling. This will lead to ground-breaking insights into the learning principles that sculpt the cortical representations of visual objects through unsupervised exposure to the spatiotemporal statistics of visual experience."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LEUKEMIABARRIER"><Rcn>185573</Rcn><Nid>12338</Nid><HI>Lunds Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>The Leukemia-Initiating Cell: Genetic Determinants, Escape Mechanisms and Ontogenic Influence</Name><PI>David Bryder</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults and strongly associated in incidence to advanced age. AML arises from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells via a sequential multistep process, but the nature of these steps remains to a large extent unknown. Therefore, while significant efforts have previously been invested in characterizing the molecular properties of late-stage AML, as diagnosed in patients, less information is available on the events that underlie leukemia initiation and progression. This includes the identity of potential mechanisms that restrict or eradicate developing leukemic cells; hurdles evaded at some point in time for AML to occur.
We have developed an inducible transgenic mouse model of AML that, when combined with high-resolution cell fractionation of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, offers a unique opportunity to track development of AML from the very first stages of cancer development. Using this, I propose to: 1) Identify and functionally validate molecular determinants that underlie why only some hematopoietic progenitor cells progress into AML, 2) To explore the extent and identity of immune surveillance/editing that accompany progression into AML, and 3) By building on my previous work on hematopoietic aging, to explore AML progression in the context of aging.
I anticipate the LEUKEMIABARRIER project to generate novel basic knowledge, not excluding with clinical relevance, with the potential to open up several new fields for further studies.

Ub can form polymers via 7 Lys residues of Ub itself. Recently, we have discovered that an E3 ligase complex, Linear Ubiquitin chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC)  generates a novel type of Ub polymer linked via Met-1, &#226;&#128;&#152;linear Ub chain&#226;&#128;&#153; and regulates NF-kB signalling in mice. Because linear Ub is unique and the study of it is still in infancy, the only E3 ligase known is LUBAC, comprising a catalytic protein HOIP, and two regulatory subunits SHARPIN and HOIL-1L. We have shown that SHARPIN deficiency leads inflammation in mice. A mutation in HOIL-1L gene of human was shown to lead immunodeficiency. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms of HOIP catalytic activity and the biological implications remain poorly understood. Here, we aim to

- Elucidate the roles of HOIP in Drosophila
- Elucidate the roles of ubiquitination and ligase activities of mammalian HOIP in vivo
- Identify novel substrates of human HOIP and clarification of their roles

We recently identified an orthologue of HOIP in Drosophila, yet its genome does not encode SHARPIN or HOIL-1L. We aim to elucidate how dmHOIP mediates linear ubiquitination in the absence of regulatory subunits and the roles of HOIP in the NF-kB signalling by genetically deleting HOIP in Drosophila. We further aim to elucidate the role of HOIP E3 ligase activity and ubiquitination in inflammation by generating the conditional knockin mice of HOIP mutants. Moreover, we will develop a protein chip assay to identify new substrates of HOIP and determine how they contribute to the biological functions.

Since Ub plays such a wide variety of pathological functions including cancer, inflammation and neuronal diseases, I believe the expected results not only will lead to a better understanding of functional role of HOIP but will also identify novel aspects of linear ubiquitination in human diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,908</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LifeWithoutInsulin"><Rcn>188654</Rcn><Nid>12207</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; De Gen&#195;&#168;ve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Metabolic actions of brain leptin receptors signaling in type 1 diabetes</Name><PI>Roberto Coppari</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>An established dogma is that insulin is absolutely required for survival. This notion has been supported by the fact that the sole life-saving intervention available to the millions affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM; an illness caused by pancreatic &#206;&#178;-cell loss and hence insulin deficiency) is insulin therapy. This treatment however does not restore normal metabolic homeostasis. In fact, the life-expectancy and -quality of T1DM people is worse compared to normal subjects. In part, this is due to challenging morbidities of T1DM, as for example heart disease and hypoglycemia, both of which are thought to be caused by insulin therapy itself. Indeed, owing to insulin&#226;&#128;&#153;s lipogenic actions, this treatment likely contributes to the ectopic lipid deposition (i.e.: in non-adipose tissues) and extremely high incidence of coronary artery disease seen in T1DM subjects. Also, due to insulin&#226;&#128;&#153;s potent, fast-acting, glycemia-lowering action, this therapy significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia; a disabling and life threatening event. Because insulin therapy does not restore metabolic homeostasis in T1DM subjects, better intervention is urgently needed. To these ends, we and others have shown that the hyperglycemic and lethal consequences of insulin deficiency can be rescued by administration of the adipocyte-secreted hormone leptin. Not only these results challenge an established view, they also raise a fundamental biological and medical question: what are the mechanisms by which leptin improves hyperglycemia and permits survival in the context of insulin deficiency? This proposal aims at identifying the critical cellular and molecular components underlying the beneficial effects of leptin in the context of insulin deficiency. Once identified, manipulation of these components has the potential to improve life-expectancy and -quality of the millions affected by insulin deficiency (e.g.: T1DM and also some late-stage type 2 diabetics).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MALMASQ"><Rcn>185589</Rcn><Nid>12012</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Understanding immune evasion by malaria parasites</Name><PI>Ron Dzikowski</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The deadliest form of human malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, which annually infects millions worldwide. Its virulence is attributed to its ability to evade the human immune system, by modifying the host red blood cell surface to adhere to the vascular endothelium and to undergo antigenic variation. Antigenic variation is achieved through switches in expression of hypervariable surface ligands named PfEMP1. These proteins are encoded by a multi-copy gene family called var. Each individual parasite expresses a single var gene at a time, whereas the remaining ~60 var genes found in its genome are maintained in a transcriptionally silent state, a phenomenon known as ""allelic exclusion"". These antigenic switches allow the parasite to avoid the human immune response and maintain a long-term infection. How mutually exclusive expression is regulated is still elusive.
The rationale of the proposed study is that understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the parasite evade human immune attack would lead to the development of therapeutic approaches that disrupt this ability and would give the human immune system an opportunity to clear the infection and overcome the disease.
I will focus this research project on understanding one of the unsolved mysteries in gene expression which is responsible for regulating antigenic variation in P. falciparum: the nature of ""communication"" between genes that allows expression of only a single gene at a time and the selection of the ""chosen one"" for activation while the rest of the gene family remains silent.
The expected outcome of this knowledge is new concepts for disrupting the parasite&#226;&#128;&#153;s ability to evade immune attack which will be exploited for the discovery of novel targets for drug and vaccine development. In addition, it will unravel mechanisms of allelic exclusion that extend beyond malaria virulence into fundamental aspect of gene expression in other organisms."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="META-BIOME"><Rcn>185584</Rcn><Nid>12002</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Deciphering the molecular language orchestrating host-microbiome interactions and their effects on health and disease</Name><PI>Eran Elinav</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The gastrointestinal tract hosts the microbiome, one of the highest microbial densities on earth. Diverse host-microbiome interactions influence a multitude of physiological and pathological processes, yet the basic mechanisms regulating host-microbiome interactions remain unknown. Deciphering the codes comprising the host-microbiome communication network and factors initiating loss of homeostasis (termed dysbiosis) will enable the recognition of pathways and signals critically important to initiation and progression of common immune and metabolic disorders. We recently identified the NLRP6 inflammasome as a critical innate immune regulator of colonic microbial ecology, with its disruption resulting in auto-inflammation and tumorigenesis. We will use this unique system, coupled with innovative robotic high-throughput modalities, gnotobiotics, metagenomics and multiple genetically altered mouse models to generalize our studies and decipher the critical principles governing host-microbiome interactions. We will elucidate the host-derived microbiome recognition signaling pathway at its entirety, from its upstream activators to the downstream effector molecules controlling microbial ecology; uncover the principles generating a stable microbiota composition; and develop and apply computational modelling to dissect the general mechanisms disrupting microbiome stability leading to dysbiosis. Using this innovative experimental and computational toolbox we will study the impact of dysbiosis on key components of the metabolic syndrome, and apply our findings to devise the first rational proof-of-concept approach for individualized microbiome-based treatment for these common disorders. At the basic science level, unraveling the principles of host-microbiota interactions will lead to a conceptual leap forward in our understanding of physiology and disease.

Recent studies indicate that socio-demographic and environmental factors are more important for disease development than genetics, and we and others have demonstrated that the gut microbiota can be considered an environmental factor that contributes to obesity. Effective treatment for obesity remains a challenge and bariatric surgery is the only available therapy that is proven to maintain weight loss. Intriguingly, bariatric surgery also improves glucose metabolism, but the underlying molecular mechanisms for this beneficial effect are unclear. An altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases and pilot studies indicate that the gut microbiota is also altered upon bariatric surgery; these findings suggest that some of the improved metabolic features following bariatric surgery may be mediated by altered composition of the gut microbiota. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate clinical research with mechanistic studies in mice to determine if and how the gut microbiota mediates the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery. We will define how bariatric surgery alters the gut metagenome in humans, both at a species and at a functional level. By transferring the fecal microbiota from these patients before and after surgery to germ-free mice, we will determine if an altered gut microbiota directly modulates host metabolism. Finally, we will establish surgical methods in germ-free mice to directly test whether the beneficial effects observed following surgery require a microbiota. Increased understanding of these mechanisms may provide the basis for non-surgical treatments based on supplementation of novel probiotics to treat metabolic diseases. Follow-up work in larger clinical cohorts may also indicate how patients can be stratified to determine who would benefit the most from bariatric surgery."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MICARUS"><Rcn>185605</Rcn><Nid>12331</Nid><HI>Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie Van Wetenschappen - Knaw, Netherlands</HI><Name>MicroRNA function in cardiac and metabolic disease</Name><PI>Eva Van Rooij</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite numerous treatment options the prevalence of cardiovascular indications continues to increase, underscoring the need for new therapeutic strategies.

In recent years, prominent roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been uncovered in a variety of cardiovascular disorders. miRNAs are short, single stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression by suppressing multiple, often related, mRNAs.
Our studies have focussed on the cardiac specific miRNA, miR-208. We showed that, in the setting of heart failure, genetic deletion as well as therapeutic inhibition of miR-208 resulted in reduced cardiac remodeling (less hypertrophy and fibrosis), the inability to upregulate beta-MHC (a sensitive marker of pathological cardiac stress) and improved survival.
Unexpectedly, mice treated with antimiR-208 displayed resistance to obesity and enhanced glucose metabolism in a mouse model of type II diabetes. These effects suggest that the heart plays a previously unrecognized role in systemic metabolic control via a miR-208 dependent mechanism.
Although these studies indicate a crucial role for miR-208 in cardiac remodeling and systemic metabolism, the mechanism of action still remains to be defined. Our preliminary gene expression data indicate a cohort of miR-208 targets to be regulated in our stress models, many of which so far have unknown or ill-studied cardiac functions.

The aim of the present proposal is to use genetics, gene expression analyses, stress models and antimiR approaches to study the relevance of downstream miR-208 targets for cardiac remodeling and total body metabolism and explore whether additional miRNAs besides miR-208 are relevant for cardiometabolic disease. Together these projects will increase our mechanistic understanding of miRNA function in cardiac and metabolic disease which will advance the clinical application of miRNA therapeutics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MIRNABETAIDENTITY"><Rcn>185656</Rcn><Nid>11997</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>microRNAs confer robustness to adult beta&#226;&#128;&#147;cell identity</Name><PI>Eran Hornstein</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Normal physiology depends on defined functional output of differentiated cells.

These discoveries necessitate investigations of key questions: How is cell&#226;&#128;&#147;type identity robustly maintained for decades in the adult organism? What are the genetic mechanisms for continuous maintenance of differentiation and identity? microRNAs, are known to impart robustness to differentiation. Do they play important roles in maintenance of adult &#206;&#178;&#226;&#128;&#147;cell identity?

Our overarching objective is to explore the exciting hypotheses that

(ii) microRNAs confer robustness to adult &#206;&#178;&#226;&#128;&#147;cell identity by repressing disallowed genes that are deleterious to &#206;&#178;&#226;&#128;&#147;cells.

The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#206;&#179; coactivator 1&#206;&#177; (PGC-1&#206;&#177;) is one of the major regulatory hubs of muscle adaptation to endurance training. Accordingly, elevated expression of PGC-1&#206;&#177; in muscle is sufficient to induce a trained phenotype in mice. Inversely, mice lacking a functional PGC-1&#206;&#177; gene in skeletal muscle exhibit many signs of pathological inactivity. Finally, PGC-1&#206;&#177; expression is dysregulated in pathological contexts in human muscle, including type 2 diabetes and aging. Therefore, the study of the regulation and function of PGC-1&#206;&#177; in muscle has the potential to yield important insights into the molecular mechanisms that control muscle health.
Unfortunately, the characterization of PGC-1&#206;&#177; is drastically hampered by the high complexity of the transcriptional network controlled by this coactivator protein, which binds to many different transcription factor binding partners in a cell context-specific manner. Moreover, PGC-1&#206;&#177; seems to directly couple transcription to RNA processing, thereby further complicating the analysis of PGC-1&#206;&#177;-controlled biological programs.

Firmicutes bacteria utilize as thiol redox buffer bacillithiol (Cys-GlcN-Mal, BSH) and Actinomycetes produce the related redox buffer mycothiol (AcCys-GlcN-Ins, MSH). In eukaryotes, proteins are post-translational modified to S-glutathionylated proteins in response to oxidative stress. S-glutathionylation has emerged as major redox-regulatory mechanism and protects cysteine residues against overoxidation to sulfonic acids. Using thiol-redox proteomics and mass spectrometry (MS) we have recently discovered protein S-bacillithiolations as mixed BSH protein disulfides in response to oxidative stress in Firmicutes bacteria. Protein S-bacillithiolation controls the activity of the redox-sensing OhrR repressor and protects active site cysteine residues of metabolic enzymes, antioxidant function proteins and translation factors. However, it is unknown if ROS and infection conditions cause protein S-mycothiolations and affect the cellular MSH redox potential in pathogenic Mycobacteria and Corynebacteria.

In pregnant women, malaria infected red blood cells express a protein that binds to a distinct carbohydrate structure present only on cells of the maternal side of the placental circulation, but not elsewhere in the vasculature. This highly evolved binding system enables the parasite to evade clearance and infect placental tissue, causing pregnancy-associated malaria. This malaria protein binds to most cancer cells with a highly specific and strong interaction. It is apparent that cancer cells commonly express this modified glycoprotein, also found on placental cells, but rarely on normal somatic cells. The carbohydrate structures enable cancer cells to migrate and invade surrounding normal tissue, and to play a role in metastatic spread of the primary lesion.
I have preliminary data showing that (1) the malaria protein binds specifically to a wide range of cancer cells and patient cancer tissues including melanoma, lymphoma, carcinomas and sarcomas, whereas no binding is detected to normal healthy cells or tissue, and (2) cancer cells treated with the malaria protein have markedly reduced growth and migration capacity.
This raises the intriguing possibility that we can use this naturally refined parasite-host interaction mechanism as a tool to specifically target cancer and inhibit the metastatic potential. Furthermore, as the malaria protein binds strongly to patient-derived cancer tissues, the malaria protein could be used to differentiate between specific subtypes of cancers and possibly advance the diagnostic process in clinical settings. The proposed project augments a novel strategy of targeting a wide range of receptors involved in human disease using pathogen derived evolutionary refined ligands. I expect this project to pioneer the use of inherently refined parasite-host interactions as a tool to combat human malignant disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MechComm"><Rcn>189852</Rcn><Nid>11262</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>Mechanotransduction in Cell-to-Cell Communication</Name><PI>Ana Isabel De Sousa Teixeira</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Cell-to-cell communication pathways coordinate cellular functions in multicellular organisms.

The objective of this research program is to address the hypothesis that the physical context of the ligand/receptor interaction contributes to defining the fundamental mechanisms of action of cell-to-cell communication pathways and their cellular outcomes.
The research program relies on the development of tools that provide well-defined physical inputs to cells, not confounded by simultaneous changes in chemical inputs. Therefore, beyond state-of-the-art developments in nanotechnology are here integrated with cell biology. In particular, DNA origami technology is applied to the development of ligand nanoclusters with customized spatial organization and mechanical properties. These ligand nanoclusters are used to probe the roles of physical properties of the ligand presentation on the activation of intracellular signalling pathways.
We will focus on the ephrin/Eph cell-to-cell communication pathway, which regulates embryonic development and the homeostasis of adult organs. ephrin/Eph signalling is commonly disrupted in cancer, showing tumour suppressing or tumour promoting character. The mechanisms that generate the diversity of outcomes of the ephrin/Eph pathway are largely unknown. We will use DNA origami/ephrin ligand nanoclusters to investigate whether the spatial organization and mechanical properties of ephrin ligand assemblies impact Eph receptor function and contribute to generating diversity in the pathway.

In turn, mechanical forces can also feedback on the molecular network to govern development. Several mechanosensitive proteins have been identified in animals but their role in multicellular development remains poorly documented. Plants are ideal systems to study mechanotransduction in development because their mechanics is mainly mediated by the cell wall. Here we propose to identify the plant mechanotransduction pathways and investigate their role in development, using Arabidopsis cell culture, cotyledons and shoot apical meristems as experimental systems.

We will conduct a multiscale investigation into mechanotransduction, at the level of a cell, of a small group of cells, and of the tissue. We have already characterized the response of microtubules to mechanical stress using a set of micromechanical tools in these three systems, and we have identified a mechanosensing protein, which, when impaired, causes growth coordination defects in the epidermis and altered morphogenesis. We will identify and characterize other elements of the plant mechanotransduction pathways, including mechanosensitive genes and proteins, based on preliminary results and on a well-designed screen. Scaling up, we will generate transgenic lines in which patches of cells with altered mechanical properties can be induced, and we will test whether mechanical heterogeneities are used to coordinate cell wall remodeling and cell division in neighboring cells. Last, we will investigate whether these biophysical coordinating mechanisms contribute to patterning and cell fate in organs, focusing on the epidermis, the boundaries between expression domains, and stem cell identity. We will investigate whether mutants exhibiting identity defects can be rescued with applied mechanical forces or locally modified mechanical properties.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,869,823</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Micro-RIP"><Rcn>185578</Rcn><Nid>12336</Nid><HI>Jyvaskylan Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Functional analysis of uncultivated microbes using radioisotope probing</Name><PI>Marja Tiirola</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Environmental microbiology calls for more advanced research methods for resolving microbial functions and regulation in environmental samples.

Hybridization of experimentally labeled RNA and radioactivity measurement would provide a second dimension for the sequencing analysis, facilitating various new applications in environmental microbiology, as well as potential applications for different needs of biochemistry and medical research.
The project aims to develop and test three novel RIP applications to analyse functional diversity, transcriptional regulation and mRNA processing in microbial communities, especially focusing on prokaryotic species. The applications are utilized for studying regulation of microbial decomposition, which is the key question, when predicting the effects of climate change. It is hypothesized that more frequent flood, droughts and redox fluctuations can prime the biodegradation of otherwise stable boreal carbon pools.
Functional diversity of microbes utilizing model and complex substrates is studied in terrestrial and aquatic environments using time-series samplings and labeling experiments.

A great challenge in medical mycology is to understand how fungal virulence evolves. The vast majority of fungal species are not human pathogens and, for those that are, virulence appears to have evolved independently on many different occasions.  Identifying the step(s) that convert an environmental fungus into a human pathogen, as well as subsequent changes in virulence within a pathogenic lineage, is therefore of fundamental importance.  Based on a number of lines of evidence, I hypothesise that a critical regulator of fungal virulence in animal hosts is the activity of the fungal mitochondrion, an energy-generating organelle present in almost all eukaryotes.  I propose to test this hypothesis comprehensively by combining genetic and cell biological approaches with high-resolution imaging methods.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,991,629</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MitoShape"><Rcn>188679</Rcn><Nid>12215</Nid><HI>Max-Delbruck-Centrum Fur Molekulare Medizin In Der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, Germany</HI><Name>Structural basis of mitochondrial inner membrane shape and dynamic</Name><PI>Oliver Daumke</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Here, I propose to study the structure and mechanisms of the cellular machineries mediating the shape and dynamics of the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM). The mitochondrial IM contains membrane invaginations called cristae. These are connected by tubular openings, the crista junctions, to the remaining IM. Mitochondrial shape constantly changes due to membrane fission and fusion events, and a balance of both processes is required for proper functioning of mitochondria. Abnormal mitochondrial shape and altered dynamics are associated with severe diseases, such as cancer and neurodegeneration.
Sourcing my group&#226;&#128;&#153;s expertise in dynamin superfamily GTPases, I wish to understand the molecular mechanisms of how OPA1 can achieve mitochondrial IM fusion and cristae formation. To this end, the X-ray crystallographic structure of OPA1 will be determined and complemented by a comprehensive biochemical characterization. Cell-based assays will be employed to decipher the exact mechanism by which OPA1 carries out its two functions and how specific mutations in OPA1 disturb these processes and, thereby, induce human disease.
The multiprotein MINOS complex was recently shown to be involved in the formation of crista junctions. I propose to explore the architecture of the MINOS complex. To this end, X-ray crystallographic structures of single components, subcomplexes and, eventually, the complete complex will be determined. Based on these structures, the mechanism of MINOS in mitochondrial membrane remodeling and crista junction formation will be dissected using a structure-based mutagenesis approach.
Components of MINOS were shown to interact with OPA1 and with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The interactions of MINOS with OPA1 and SAM will be biochemically mapped and structurally characterized. To understand their functions, the effect of disrupting mutations on crista junction formation and mitochondrial dynamics will be explored.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,972</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MoMAAV"><Rcn>189846</Rcn><Nid>11807</Nid><HI>Universite Pierre Et Marie Curie - Paris 6, France</HI><Name>Molecular signatures and Modulation of immunity to Adeno-Associated Virus vectors</Name><PI>Federico Mingozzi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Experience with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer in human trials has unveiled the therapeutic potential of this approach, with some of the most exciting results coming from clinical studies of gene transfer for hemophilia B, congenital blindness, and the recent market approval of the first AAV-based gene therapy in Europe. Follow-up data of subjects treated with AAV vectors is showing sustained correction of the disease phenotype for several years after gene transfer, and recent data confirmed that AAV vectors can drive expression of a transgene in humans for &gt;10 years. With clinical development, however, some of the limitations of the approach, not entirely identified in preclinical studies, became obvious; in particular it is well established that the host immune system represents an important obstacle to be overcome in terms of both safety and efficacy of gene transfer in vivo with AAV vectors. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain critical, missing knowledge on the interactions between AAV vectors and the immune system in order to develop strategies to achieve safe, effective, and long-lasting gene transfer in humans.
In this proposal we will: 1) Define the molecular signatures of the immune system in humans undergoing gene transfer with AAV vectors using cutting-edge, high-content immunophenotyping technologies; 2) Study the role of anti-AAV antibodies as determinants of AAV capsid immunogenicity using both in vitro and in vivo systems; 3) Identify novel pharmacological and cellular approaches to overcome T cell immunity to AAV; 4) Develop novel strategies to overcome pre-existing antibody responses to AAV.
This proposal exploits the knowledge and the skills available in our lab to develop new tools and to provide novel, basic insights into the human immune responses to AAV that will have a direct impact on the quality of life of patients affected by inherited disorders.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,730,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MultiPOC"><Rcn>185592</Rcn><Nid>12005</Nid><HI>Kungliga Tekniska Hoegskolan, Sweden</HI><Name>Highly Multiplexed Affinity Proteomics for Point of Care Diagnostics</Name><PI>Helene Andersson Svahn</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The main objective is the development of highly multiplexed affinity proteomics tools for point of care diagnostics. Enabled by the world's largest resource of antibodies to human protein targets generated within the framework of the Human Protein Atlas program, the aim of this application is to develop new concepts in translational medical research to allow dramatic improvement in performance and accessibility of point of care tests in both high and low resource clinical settings in infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions and several cancers. To achieve the goal, developments will be made in 1) detection principles and sample preparation, 2) rapid and low cost protein microarrays assays and 3) novel amplification strategies. Strategies will be developed to for the first time enable highly multiplexed sandwich detection across the analytical range of the plasma proteome. Four different novel microarray formats amenable for point of care are presented that each will allow dramatically improved multiplexity and high performance. Different types of new multifunctional silica/gold nanoparticles exhibiting combinations of magnetic, fluorescent, electro-active, enzymatic and optical qualities that will allow deterministic actuation and multimodal detection options will be synthesized and applied for exquisite sensitivity and rapid detection. Following the technology development, developed assay systems will be implemented for full plasma proteome analysis and in the three clinical areas: infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions and cancers. Collaborations with clinical researchers in all the relevant fields have already been established. In theses clinical fields, a body of previous research efforts has shown that highly multiplexed plasma analysis may dramatically improve diagnostic accuracy, and it is here that the novel comprehensive point of care systems presented in this proposal may conceivably create the largest impact for patients and health care systems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Mycinhibinclinic"><Rcn>189847</Rcn><Nid>11806</Nid><HI>Fundacio Privada Institut D&#226;&#128;&#153;Investigacio Oncologica De Vall-Hebron, Spain</HI><Name>Pushing Myc inhibition towards the clinic</Name><PI>Laura Soucek</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Deregulation of the Myc oncogene promotes tumorigenesis in most if not all cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis. However, targeting Myc has long been considered impossible because of potential catastrophic side effects in normal tissues. Despite this general assumption, we showed that Myc inhibition displays extraordinary therapeutic benefit in various transgenic mouse models of cancer, and caused only mild, well-tolerated and reversible side effects in normal tissues. For these studies we have employed a dominant negative of Myc, called Omomyc, which we designed and validated, and that is able to inhibit Myc transactivation function both in vitro and in vivo. Omomyc has so far been utilized exclusively as gene therapy and served the purpose of pre-clinically validating the therapeutic impact of systemic Myc inhibition. In this proposal we intend to push such a therapeutic approach further towards the clinic, making use of
1. Omomyc-based Cell Penetrating Peptides (CPPs): a novel, state-of-the-art potential method for directly utilising Omomyc itself (or a similar peptide) as a drug;
2. A new generation of Myc inhibitory small molecules generated by our collaborators at the Roswell Park Cancer Center.

Anaphylaxis is thought to rely on mechanisms involving mast cells that bear allergen-specific IgE and that release histamine when encountering allergen. Clinical cases, however, report anaphylaxis in the absence of specific IgE or medical history of allergy. We reported that murine models of anaphylaxis rely on IgG, rather than on IgE, that enable neutrophils, monocytes and basophils, rather than mast cells, to release Platelet Activating Factor following engagement of their IgG receptors. Supporting these findings, allergen-specific IgG are found in anaphylactic patients, and we reported that anaphylaxis in mice expressing a human IgG receptor relies also on circulating myeloid cells.

We aim at unravelling the parameters that control anaphylaxis in a novel clinically-relevant model of drug-induced anaphylaxis, strengthened by human-based studies involved patients undergoing drug-induced anaphylaxis in collaboration with clinicians and, altogether, rethink the principles of anaphylaxis. Do allergen-specific IgG concur to anaphylaxis in humans? Do these IgG antibodies regulate IgE-induced reactions? Which IgG receptors are involved? In which tissue does the anaphylactic reaction start? Which cell type(s) are responsible? Among the mediators that are released, which ones are responsible for the shock? Can an anaphylactic reaction be stopped specifically for an allergen? We propose to address these questions by exploiting humanized mice we obtained and by establishing novel models, by visualizing anaphylactic reactions in real time in vivo, by dissecting the cascade of events leading to the shock. Finally, we aim at establishing the proof of concept of allergen capture/encapsulation and propose the first allergen-specific strategy for treating the life-threatening clinical situation that represents drug-induced anaphylaxis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,704</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEURALCHUNK"><Rcn>191295</Rcn><Nid>11894</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

Although basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in action chunking, little is known about how individual elements are concatenated into a behavioral unit at the neuronal level. Using a differential reinforcement procedure where mice learn to chunk rapid action sequences, we uncovered neuronal activity encoding entire sequences as single actions in basal ganglia circuits. Besides activity signaling sequence initiation (start), we found neurons with sustained or inhibited activity throughout the execution of an entire sequence. These findings clearly show that basal ganglia circuits display neural activity related to the execution of whole action sequences, rather than unitary elements. Neurons with start, sustained and inhibited sequence-related activity were observed throughout the basal ganglia, namely in the main input (striatum), and output (substantia nigra reticulata) nuclei of the basal ganglia. However, the basal ganglia have different cell types/subcircuits linking input to output, the so called direct ves. indirect  pathways. Furthermore, basal ganglia output projects to different target areas. Here we will 1) determine if these correlates of motor concatenation are differentially expressed in direct versus indirect basal ganglia pathways by optogenetic identification of cell types in the striatum and in vivo imaging, 2) test the necessity and sufficiency of these two pathways in action sequence initiation and performance, and 3) test if different basal ganglia output circuits express and mediate different aspects of action chunking.

Understanding function seems to be on relatively solid grounds at the periphery where both anatomy and physiology converge in a simplified manner. However, as one ascends higher into the central nervous system, anatomy and physiology become increasingly more complex and functions become difficult to study. To reveal function, we will take a structure/function approach that synergizes between anatomical, physiological and behavioral methods. Namely, we will study the physiology of identified neurons to a rich set of stimuli bearing different behavioural contingencies and in the context of their anatomical boundaries. Specifically, my proposal aims to uncover function and structure of the mouse auditory cortex. First, we will redefine local and distant functional architecture in the auditory cortex using novel tracing techniques. Second, we will test a specific hypothesis whereas individual cortical neurons are multifunctional and part of distinct but multiple sub-networks. Third, we will use novel genetic techniques to tag and manipulate distinct cortical processing streams that are active during natural behaviors and specific learning paradigms. These experiments will answer whether specific sub-networks are instructive, permissive or necessary for perception. Finally, we will study how single neurons and sub-networks change in face of perceptual learning. As a whole, the main premise of this grant is to set the stage for, and eventually crystallize the experimental means to tease out functional diversity of single neurons in complex anatomical networks. Charting these basic principles for single neurons will impact how we study neuronal function and plasticity not only in the auditory system but across the mammalian brain."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NImO"><Rcn>191233</Rcn><Nid>11903</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Neural and Immune Orchestrators of Forebrain Wiring</Name><PI>Sonia No&#195;&#169;mie Garel</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Forebrain functioning relies on complex circuits that begin to be established in the embryo by intrinsic developmental programs. Such programs coordinate the assembly of millions of neurons via an integrated choreography of neuronal migration and axonal navigation, which remains largely to be explored. In addition, intrinsic programs can be modulated by maternal environment, as illustrated by the fact that prenatal inflammation is a major risk factor for schizophrenia and autism. Understanding how embryonic programs and maternal signals control forebrain wiring is essential not only to progress in our comprehension of cerebral morphogenesis but also to provide a framework for assessing the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.
We have shown that two cell populations, corridor neurons and more recently microglia, act by their specific positioning and properties as orchestrators of forebrain wiring. Migrating corridor neurons regulate the ordering of thalamocortical axons, a main input to the neocortex. Microglia, the resident brain macrophages that are activated by prenatal inflammation, specifically regulate the progression of cortical and dopaminergic axons and the positioning of migrating cortical interneurons. Our work not only reveals the complex interactions governing forebrain wiring, but also a remarkable interplay in the development of the neural and immune systems. We now aim at deciphering the roles of these neural and immune cells during embryonic wiring of the forebrain. By multi-disciplinary approaches in mice we will investigate: i) how corridor neurons govern the ordering of thalamic axons; ii) how microglia regulate axonal progression and neuronal migration; iii) how microglia depletion or prenatal activation impacts in the long-term on forebrain functions. This ambitious project will provide essential knowledge on the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing forebrain wiring during normal and pathological development.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,659</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NO-DISEASE"><Rcn>185541</Rcn><Nid>13170</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Developing novel therapies for systemic disorders by regulating Nitric Oxide (NO) substrates' availability</Name><PI>Ayelet Erez</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential signalling molecule for diverse physiological and disease processes.  The current paradigm of how NO production is regulated focuses at the level of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), with respect to substrate and co-factor availability and the precise spatial and temporal arrangement of protein complexes.  However, the respective unique or combined genetic deficiencies of the NOS isoforms exhibit relatively modest phenotypes in mice.  Moreover, approaches targeted at modulating NOS activities have not successfully translated into different disease applications.  All NOS isoforms are dependent on arginine as their sole substrate and interestingly, only one enzyme in mammals argininosuccinic lyase (ASL), can generate endogenous arginine. We propose that global regulation of NO production occurs earlier at the step of regulating arginine substrate availability within the cell.  Until now, regulation at the level of arginine availability has been under-appreciated since arginine is readily available from external and dietary sources, irrespective of endogenous cellular production.  However, extracellular arginine levels can affect NO production even though the intracellular levels of arginine are saturated.
In humans, the natural history of argininosuccinic aciduria caused by deficiency of ASL shows systemic and chronic features that reflect in part global dysregulation of NO homeostasis.  This led us to discover that ASL is required for the channelling of both endogenously synthesized arginine and exogenous arginine to NOS.   By challenging the existing paradigm, I hypothesize that regulating ASL would allow us to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NO flux regulation at normal and pathological conditions, for therapeutic applications. This proposal is hence novel both in its concept but also in its approach that is based on targeting therapy for systemic disorders through regulating cellular metabolism.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,915,555</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuroKinematics"><Rcn>188674</Rcn><Nid>12222</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Neuronal Dynamics of the Basal Ganglia and the Kinematics of Motor Habits</Name><PI>David Robbe</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Motor habits are well learned spatiotemporally ordered sequences of movements executed without being explicitly motivated by a goal. Habits are formed following long trial-and-error learning periods but once acquired they tend to persist even when their beneficial outcome is degraded. Despite the behavioral importance of habits and their dramatic alteration in several pathologies (Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome, addictions) the neuronal mechanisms behind habitual actions are unclear. On the one hand, lesions or dysfunction of the basal ganglia (BG) are well known to alter the formation and execution of habits. On the other hand, it is generally assumed that the function of the BG is to initiate adapted actions while inhibiting unwanted ones. This action selection model implies that the BG does not contribute to the control of the kinematics of actions (how selected actions are executed). A major problem of the action selection model is that it does not explain why BG dysfunctions result in specific deficits in movement kinematics.

Here, on the basis of recent findings from our team, we will test the hypothesis that, rather than selecting actions, neuronal activity in the BG plays a crucial role in controlling the kinematics of habitual actions. We will combine large-scale recordings of spiking activity in the BG (striatum) and related structures (primary motor cortex and thalamus) with optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations of neuronal activity in behaving rodents. Importantly we will use new behavioral tasks specifically designed to capture the often overlooked spatiotemporal structure of habits. The results obtained will shed new lights on the network and cellular mechanisms driving habits, the controversial function of the BG and the broader issue of motor learning. A better understanding of these topics is a required step toward improving the treatment of the numerous diseases of the BG, including those impairing habits.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,846,073</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuroMT"><Rcn>189837</Rcn><Nid>10802</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Building the Neuronal Microtubule Cytoskeleton</Name><PI>Casper Cassander Hoogenraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Microtubules (MTs) are one of the major cytoskeletal components of the cell, essential for many fundamental cellular and developmental processes, such as cell division, motility and polarity. In large and highly polarized cells like neurons, MTs have been regarded as essential structures for stable neuronal morphology and serve as tracks for long-distance transport; however, fundamental new insights into the role of neural MTs have emerged. New findings demonstrate that the MT cytoskeleton plays an active role during different phases of neuronal development: MTs determine axon formation, control polarized cargo trafficking, and regulate the dynamics of dendritic spines, the major sites of excitatory synaptic input. Failures in MT function have been linked to various neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and recent studies highlight MTs as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
How neuronal MTs are formed and stabilized during neuronal polarity and differentiation is largely unknown, and whether this requires the centrosome is under debate. The overall aim of this proposal is to investigate basic mechanisms responsible for organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton during neuronal development. Here, we will take a multidisciplinary approach and combine biochemistry, neurobiology, molecular engineering, and advanced microscopy to study the role of MTs at three stages of neuronal differentiation. We propose to determine: i) the role of (non-)centrosomal MT nucleation during early development, ii) the mechanism by which dendrites organize MTs into anti-parallel arrays, iii) the relation between MTs spine entry and cargo transport in mature neurons. We anticipate that these studies will uncover how the MT cytoskeleton is built and organized at different phases of neuronal development, which will be relevant for understanding polarized transport, synaptic processes and associated neurodegenerative disorders.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuroMolAnatomy"><Rcn>192402</Rcn><Nid>13472</Nid><HI>Universitaetsmedizin Goettingen - Georg-August-Universitaet Goettingen - Stiftung Oeffentlichen Rechts, Germany</HI><Name>The Molecular Anatomy of Neurons</Name><PI>Silvio Olivier Rizzoli</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The brain is nowadays the object of a number of extensive systematic studies that focus on seemingly all aspects of its morphology and function, from overall brain architecture to neuronal connections, neuronal morphology and gene expression. However, at least one basic aspect is as yet incompletely studied: the molecular anatomy of the neuron, i.e., the copy numbers and the spatial arrangement of molecules within the neuronal cell. This cannot be addressed by gene expression or proteomics approaches, as they do not have sufficient spatial precision. Electron microscopy, ideal for unraveling the neuronal morphology, does not have sufficient protein labeling efficiency. My project aims to fill this gap by a combination of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, advanced fluorescence labelling techniques and advanced biochemistry tools such as quantitative mass spectometry. My objectives are fourfold: 1) to determine the molecular organization of at least 200 major neuronal proteins: their exact copy numbers and their position within the cell determined with nanoscale precision; 2) to generate a bank of biochemistry and microscopy sample preparations that will be available world-wide for the characterization of 1000-2000 additional proteins; 3) to integrate results into an in silico neuronal model that can be used for modelling functional neuronal parameters; 4) to use this technology to determine the changes in neuronal anatomy caused by neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s and Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s Diseases.

In order to uncover how different regions of the neocortex process sensory information, it is necessary to understand how the pattern and properties of synaptic connections in a specific sensory circuit determine the computations it performs. I propose to establish the relationship between synaptic connectivity and neuronal function in primary visual cortex (V1) with the aim of revealing circuit-level mechanisms of sensory processing. To this end, my laboratory has developed a new method, by which visual response properties of neurons are first characterised with two-photon calcium imaging in vivo, and then synaptic connections between a subset of these neurons are assayed with multiple whole-cell recordings in slices of the same tissue. We will use this method to determine how connectivity, synaptic and intrinsic properties of different excitatory and inhibitory cell types relate to the emergence of their visual receptive fields (RFs). Specifically, we will test the dependence of connections on RF position, structure and other visual response properties, the specificity of connections between simple and complex cells, and the relative contribution of feedforward and recurrent excitation and inhibition towards shaping RFs.

Phenotypic evolution is thought to be largely founded on developmental gene regulatory changes, which determine species-specific tissue morphologies and thus lay the foundation for their typical physiological properties. We recently performed the first cross-mammalian transcriptome comparisons for adult organs, providing many insights into the molecular evolution of organ physiologies, but the evolution of developmental transcriptomes remains largely unstudied. I propose to generate comprehensive RNA sequencing data for a collection of adult tissues and developmental precursors from many mammals and tetrapod outgroup species (birds, reptiles, amphibians). The data will include dense ontogenetic time courses for key reference species, covering embryonic stages and, for mammals, placental tissues. We will identify coding and noncoding genes constituting core ancestral tissue transcriptomes and assess relative contributions of gene expression changes and the emergence of new genes to the evolution of phenotypically relevant expression patterns. We will also empirically evaluate global models of evolutionary conservation patterns during embryogenesis and placentation. To understand the dynamics of functional and regulatory interactions of different gene types and their evolutionary relevance, we will reconstruct evolutionary transcription networks and assess associated regulatory mechanisms. Overall, this inter-disciplinary &#226;&#128;&#156;evo-devo&#226;&#128;&#157; project will unveil ontogenetic and adult gene expression programs underlying shared (ancestral) and lineage-specific morphological and physiological phenotypes.

The project will apply design and selection strategies aiming at nucleic acid molecules that can be controlled by irradiation with light and which we have developed in preliminary studies. This will now be taken significant steps forward by generating modular allosteric ribonucleic acid (RNA) assemblies that respond to light. These assemblies provide a generic solution and represent long-sought methods to complement the optogenetic toolbox. The aim of this project is the generation of allosteric molecules built from at least two RNA domains; one domain that binds to a soluble photoreceptor protein (PRP) in a light-dependent manner and a second RNA domain, whose protein inhibiting function in turn depends on the binding state of the PRP-recognizing part. We will construct light-responsive allosteric RNA assemblies that can be ubiquitously used in cells and in vivo, independent of specific model organisms, for optogenetic control and spatiotemporal analysis of endogenous, intracellular biomolecule function. The project is highly interdisciplinary and will open novel routes for biomolecule analysis in cells and in vivo. It has implications ranging from life sciences to optogenetics, and from combinatorial biochemistry to synthetic biology. As these new tools will be applicable by any scientist to analyse protein function at high spatiotemporal resolution, the project bears an enormous innovative potential.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PANDA"><Rcn>189825</Rcn><Nid>11820</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Phylogenetic ANalysis of Diversification Across the tree of life</Name><PI>H&#195;&#169;l&#195;&#168;ne Morlon</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Explaining the tremendous disparity in the number of species among different taxonomic groups and geographic regions is one of the greatest challenges in biodiversity research.  This project aims to significantly advance our fundamental understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that explain how species richness is distributed on earth and in the tree of life. The first part of the project consists in significantly improving phylogenetic approaches to diversification. This implies developing stochastic lineage-based birth-death models that account for species interactions, stochastic lineage-based birth-death models integrating phylogenetic and fossil information, and stochastic individual-based birth-death-speciation models. The second part of the project consists in implementing these models, as well as other recently developed models, in efficient and user-friendly software packages. Finally, the third part of the project consists in applying these phylogenetic tools to large datasets spanning the tree of life in order to understand how and why speciation and extinction rates vary over evolutionary time, geographical space, and species groups. We will use our new phylogenetic comparative methods to uncover diversity-through-time curves for a wide variety of taxonomic groups, evaluate the relative role of the biotic and the abiotic environment in driving diversification, shed new light on the latitudinal diversity gradient, and consider microbial diversity with a macroevolutionary perspective.

Climate warming, atmospheric deposition of acidifying and eutrophying pollutants and land-use change are three of the most important threats to biodiversity in temperate forests. However, most studies focused on the effects of single factors over short time periods, such that our ability to predict the combined effects of multiple global change drivers over longer time periods remains rudimentary. The lack of knowledge on effects of global change drivers on forest herb layer communities is particularly striking, since the herb layer contains the largest part of vascular plant diversity in temperate forests and provides key ecosystem services. Therefore PASTFORWARD will build an integrative understanding of the interactive effects of land-use change, atmospheric deposition and climate warming on forest herb layer communities, starting from the insight that changes in herb layer communities are driven primarily by past land use, but can be modulated by atmospheric deposition, climate warming and forest management. Indeed, it is still largely ignored that sensible predictions of herb layer development trajectories under global change can only be made by taking the forest&#226;&#128;&#153;s land-use history into account, as legacies of past land use can leave century-long imprints on forest herb layer communities. Three complementary data sources (a database with resurveyed vegetation plots, field measurements in a pan-European network of resurvey plots, and a multi-factor experiment) combined with an ecosystem model will be used. Furthermore, concepts and tools from different disciplines, ranging from history over sylviculture to community and ecosystem ecology will be applied. The results of PASTFORWARD will help forest managers and policy makers in taking more informed decisions on how to combine resource extraction with biodiversity conservation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,887,780</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PATHPHYLODYN"><Rcn>185560</Rcn><Nid>11373</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Pathogen Phylodynamics: Unifying Evolution, Infection and Immunity"</Name><PI>Oliver Pybus</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Genetic sequences represent a rich source of information about evolutionary and ecological processes in natural populations. However the development of methods to recover this information is being outpaced by the explosion in sequence data, especially since the introduction of &#226;&#128;&#152;next-generation&#226;&#128;&#153; sequencing. This problem is particularly acute for the inter-disciplinary field of pathogen phylodynamics. The rapid evolution of many pathogens means their ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur on the same timescale and therefore new analytical methods are required to study this joint behaviour. Further, the small genome sizes and medical importance of many viruses mean that hundreds of thousands of homologous sequences are already available, and sample sizes will continue to grow. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply multiple new frameworks of evolutionary analysis, to unlock the full potential of current data and to exploit new types of sequence data for which no rigorous analytical methods currently exist. Across four related themes I will use these novel methods to answer major unsolved questions about the evolutionary dynamics of viruses and their hosts: (i) How can we measure adaptation in data sets comprising many thousands of genomes? (ii) Can we reveal the adaptation of viral lineages to the genetic variation in immunity present in host populations? (iii) How can we combine mathematical ecological models with viral genomics to better predict the outcome of chronic HIV and hepatitis C virus infection, or the success of anti-viral drug therapy? (iv) Can we apply methods from ecology and evolution to analyse new data on immune receptor diversity, and use them to better understand the dynamics of leukaemia and viral infection?

For different reasons, much less attention has been given to the process of change within the somatic line of a multicellular individual. The formation of cancer tumors due to uncontrolled cell proliferation is one of the most prominent forms of somatic evolution. The evolution of cancer tumors in a body can be likened with the evolution of populations in more or less fragmented habitats. The tumor is usually a expanding population of clonal cells, which may differentiate to a bigger or lesser extent (population structure) and disperse to contiguous (range expansion) or more distant tissues (long distance colonization). During tumor progression, this population of cells is subject to distinct somatic evolutionary processes like mutation, drift, selection or migration, which can act at different points in time and geographical space. Very recently, the discovery of extensive intratumor heterogeneity, together with the rise of single cell genomics, has created an unique opportunity to study the phylogeography of cancer tumor cells. So far evolutionary inferences drawn from cancer genomes have been mostly qualitative. Here we propose to study a thousand single cell genomes from different regions in primary tumors and matched metastases. We will develop and apply state-of-the-art statistical and computational techniques from phylogenetics, phylogeography and population genomics to understand the tempo and mode of evolution of cell lineages within and between cancer tumors. By doing so we aim to construct a robust theoretical and methodological evolutionary framework that can contribute to a better understanding of the process of somatic evolution and shed light into the biology of cancer."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="POLLOX"><Rcn>185636</Rcn><Nid>11994</Nid><HI>Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen Deutsches Forschungszentrum Fuer Gesundheit Und Umwelt Gmbh, Germany</HI><Name>ANAEROBIC POLLUTANT DEGRADATION WITH OXYGEN</Name><PI>Tillmann Joachim L&#195;&#188;ders</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Contamination with organic pollutants is widespread in nature and a notorious threat to our water resources. Two central paradigms are currently understood to control biodegradation in groundwater and sediments: (i) Redox gradients and interphases between compartments are hot-spots for contaminant breakdown, and (ii) biodegradation is primarily limited by local electron acceptor availability, in particular of oxygen. My group has published leading contributions to this understanding in recent years, especially in elucidating the ecology of anaerobic toluene degraders in aquifers.
This project now aims to question these established paradigms and to elaborate a ground-breaking new perspective of the role of molecular oxygen in pollutant degradation in anoxic compartments. The hypotheses at the heart of the project originate from a combination of own recent findings, partially inconsistent with the current understanding of process and degrader stratification at redox gradients. These are now interpreted in the light of exciting recent advances in the fields of electromicrobiology and oxygenic anaerobic respiration.
POLLOX postulates that oxygen-dependent degradation of pollutants in anaerobic compartments is possible by two unrecognised physiological adaptations of degraders. I want to verify the hypothesis that filamentous Desulfobulbaceae can anaerobically oxidise toluene via long-distance (1-2 cm) electron transfer to oxygen across redox gradients (aim 1). Furthermore, I postulate that monooxygenase-dependent toluene degraders, in absence of external oxygen, can be active via self-sustained production of oxygen by nitric oxide dismutation (aim 2). POLLOX proposes to perform targeted lab experiments and field surveys to verify both hypotheses and to elaborate the ecological niches in which respective degraders and processes are relevant in situ (aim 3). The generic mechanisms to be elaborated here have the potential to open new doors for bioremediation in the future."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,888,920</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PREMETAZOANEVOLUTION"><Rcn>185646</Rcn><Nid>12321</Nid><HI>Universidad Pompeu Fabra, Spain</HI><Name>Unravelling the unicellular prehistory of metazoans with functional analyses and single-cell genomics</Name><PI>I&#195;&#177;aki Ruiz Trillo</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"How multicellular animals (metazoans) emerged from their single-celled ancestor remains a long-standing evolutionary question. Recent genome data has shown that the unicellular ancestor of metazoans already had a complex gene repertoire for genes involved in cell adhesion, cell signaling and transcriptional regulation, including integrins, cadherins, T-box genes, and protein tyrosine kinases. Thus, besides a few metazoan-specific genes, gene co-option and, probably, an increase in gene regulation played important roles into the origin of Metazoa. However, the lack of genetic tools among metazoan&#226;&#128;&#153;s closest relatives has so far precluded further investigations at the molecular level. Our recent establishment, for the first time, of transgenesis methodologies in two close unicellular relatives of metazoans (both the ichthyosporean Creolimax fragrantissima and the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki), allow us to approach these questions in ways that were not previously possible. Thus, we aim to push forward these two model systems and infer, by cell biology and functional genomics, the ancestral function of those genes key to multicellularity in order to understand how they were co-opted for new multicellular functions. In addition, we will analyze the regulation of the different cell stages and the colony formation (syncitial and aggregative multicellularity) in these two organism by functional genomics and identify when and how the metazoan histone code (an important regulatory layer of gene expression) evolved by analyzing the histone code in these taxa. Finally, to understand the ecology, distribution and adaptation of these unicellular taxa we will obtain the complete genome sequence of uncultured lineages by using single-cell genomics. This research will not only markedly improve our understanding of a major biological question (the origin of metazoan multicellularity) but will also generate new data relevant to a broad range of researchers."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,967,535</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PROTEODYNAMICS"><Rcn>189829</Rcn><Nid>10613</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zu Koeln, Germany</HI><Name>Global Dynamics of Proteolytic Quality Control Networks in Stress Response and Aging</Name><PI>Thorsten Hoppe</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Accumulation of damaged and aggregated proteins is associated with age-related neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s and Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s patients. The ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is a major proteolytic route functioning in a cellular network that maintains the proteome during stress and aging. Degradation of damaged proteins is mediated by the 26S proteasome upon attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) proteins (ubiquitylation). Another proteolytic system supporting protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is the autophagy-lysosome pathway that degrades proteins inside activated autophagosomes. An age-related impairment of either of these systems causes enhanced protein aggregation and affects lifespan, suggesting functional overlap and cooperation between UPS and autophagy in stress and aging. Despite the progress made in searching for key substrates that are destined for degradation, the major challenge in the field is to understand how these proteolytic systems are mechanistically coordinated to overcome age-related proteotoxicity. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to assemble a global picture of stress-induced proteolytic networks critical for aging of multicellular organisms. The tissue-specific regulation of protein degradation pathways will be addressed using the powerful genetic model of Caenorhabditis elegans. The suggested project will systematically analyze: inducible protein degradation pathways (Aim 1), the regulation of UPS and autophagy by microRNAs (miRNAs) (Aim 2), and tissue-specific adaptation of proteolytic networks (Aim 3) in stress response and aging. To this end, comprehensive transcriptome analysis, large-scale genetic screenings combined with deep-sequencing technology, and candidate approaches based on in vivo imaging and degradation assays will be performed. Together, we propose a highly complementary research plan that aims to break new grounds in the understanding of proteolytic networks in aging and disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PROduCTS"><Rcn>188652</Rcn><Nid>12208</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Anstalt Fuer Wasserversorgung Abwasserreinigung Und Gewaesserschutz, Switzerland</HI><Name>Predicting environment-specific biotransformation of chemical contaminants</Name><PI>Kathrin Barbara Fenner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The ability to predict rates and products of microbial biotransformation for a broad variety of chemical contaminants accurately is essential not only for chemical risk management but also in the context of contaminated site remediation or the development of green chemical alternatives. Existing prediction methods, however, fall short of fulfilling these needs mostly because they base predictions on chemical structure only, disregarding the microbial communities responsible for degradation and their actual metabolic potential as shaped by environmental conditions. The long-term goals of the proposed research are to develop the scientific basis and appropriate modeling algorithms for considering the metabolic potential of environmental microbial communities (i.e., the available pools of catalytic enzymes) in biotransformation prediction. It is proposed that enzyme-catalyzed biotransformation reactions are established as the explicit core elements of biotransformation prediction. The reactions so defined will serve as mechanistic basis to (i) experimentally explore the linkage between microbial community gene expression profiles and their observed potential for contaminant biotransformation, and (ii) use chemometrics and pattern analysis in high-dimensional space to mine environment-specific chemical biotransformation data for probabilities of biotransformation reactions. The resulting novel algorithms for the environment-specific prediction of biotransformation rates and products will be implemented into an existing, publically-accessible biotransformation prediction system (http://www.umbbd.ethz.ch/predict). The proposed research is highly interdisciplinary and will profit from the most recent technological and scientific advances in the fields of analytical chemistry, molecular biology and chemo-/bioinformatics to develop a ground-breaking approach for profiling the capacity of microbial communities for contaminant biotransformation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PS3"><Rcn>188663</Rcn><Nid>10639</Nid><HI>Migal Galilee Research Institute Ltd, Israel</HI><Name>An artificial water-soluble photosystem by protein design</Name><PI>Dror Noy</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project aims at producing a fully functional light energy conversion system that is inspired by, but does not necessarily mimic, the fundamental solar energy conversion unit of natural photosynthesis &#226;&#128;&#147; the photosystem.

Here, this knowledge and capabilities will be further developed and utilized for the design and construction of multi-cofactor, multi-subunit protein complexes with photosystem functionality. These will be designed to efficiently capture light in the visible and near infrared range, exploit it for driving the oxidation of a molecular redox carrier at one end, and providing highly reducing electrons at the other end.

Constructing protein scaffolds that will assemble and organize arrays of multiple pigments, and chains of redox cofactors are significant challenges at the forefront of the field of protein de novo design, and current theories of biological energy and electron transfer.
Success will set a new standard, well beyond the current state of the art, for our ability to use computational protein design methods for assembling functional protein-cofactor complexes.  These can be used as benchmarks to test and validate the engineering principles of biological energy conversion systems, as well as new ideas about their evolution.

Proteins are typically joined by reversible or non-specific linkages. We have designed a unique way to connect protein building blocks irreversibly and precisely, via spontaneous isopeptide bond formation. This involves modifying proteins with a short peptide tag (SpyTag) that is based upon remarkable chemistry used by pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. Here we will develop this novel approach to address major challenges in synthetic biology. We will engineer SpyTag capture towards infinite affinity (defined as diffusion-limited on-rate and no off-rate), to transform the sensitivity of peptide detection in living systems. We will also apply SpyTag to create a new generation of protein polymers, irreversibly assembled with molecular precision and tailored branching. In parallel we will harness SpyTag to enhance circulating tumor cell (CTC) capture, one of the most promising ways to achieve early cancer diagnosis. In capturing CTCs and other rare cells from blood, the high forces mean that even the strongest non-covalent linkages fail. SpyTag covalent bridging, in concert with super-resolution live cell fluorescence microscopy, will give us the opportunity to answer key questions about the forces and membrane dynamics at the magnetic bead:cell synapse. We will exploit these insights and SpyTag-assembled antibody polymers to dramatically reduce the threshold of antigen expression for CTC capture.

Nuclear positioning depends on connections between nuclear envelope proteins and the cytoskeleton. In migrating cells, we found that the nucleus is positioned away from the front of the cell and this event is important for cell migration. We performed an RNAi screen for nuclear positioning and found new nuclear envelope proteins involved in nuclear positioning. In fully developed myofibers, nuclei are specifically positioned at the periphery of the myofiber, while during development and regeneration, as well as in multiple muscle pathologies, the nucleus is centrally positioned. We found new mechanisms drive nuclear movement during myofiber formation. We also showed that nuclear position is important for muscle function. However why nuclear positioning is important for myofiber activity remains an open question.

We now propose to use unique systems to monitor cell migration and myofiber formation in combination with biochemistry, cell biology, high- and super-resolution microscopy approaches to:

1) Identify novel molecular mechanisms that mediate nuclear positioning during cell migration and myofiber formation.

3) Determine a role for nuclear positioning in myofiber function as well as the significance of altered nuclear positioning in different forms of muscle pathology.

The proposed work will establish new mechanisms for nuclear positioning. Importantly, by identifying mechanisms and understanding the role of nuclear positioning in myofiber function, we will lay the foundations for future studies to ameliorate or treat muscle disorders as well as other conditions where nucleus positioning may prove to play a role such as cancer.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,968,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PolyDorm"><Rcn>185659</Rcn><Nid>12317</Nid><HI>Tel Aviv University, Israel</HI><Name>Uncovering the molecular and cellular mechanism of tumor dormancy for the rational design of theranostic nanomedicines</Name><PI>Ronit Satchi-Fainaro</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Tumor progression is dependent on a number of sequential steps, including initial tumor-vascular interactions and recruitment of blood vessels, as well as an established interaction of tumor cells with their surrounding microenvironment. Failure of a microscopic tumor, either primary, recurrent or metastatic, to complete one or more of these early stages may lead to delayed clinical manifestation of the cancer and a state of stable non-progressing disease. Micrometastasis, dormant tumors, and residual tumor cells contribute to the occurrence of relapse, and constitute fundamental clinical manifestations of tumor dormancy that together are responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths. However, although the tumor dormancy phenomenon has critical implications for early detection and treatment of cancer, its biology and genetic characteristics are poorly understood. We now propose to investigate the molecular and cellular changes in tumor-host interactions that govern tumor dormancy, which may lead to the discovery of novel tumor dormancy targets and provide tools for dormancy-dependent tumor therapy strategies. In order to achieve this goal, we will integrate the following basic and translational approaches: (i) Establishment of mouse models of dormant and fast-growing tumor pairs; (ii) Functional and molecular characterization of dormant versus fast-growing tumors, (iii) Design of dormancy-promoting tailor-made polymer therapeutics delivering a combination of microRNAs with chemotherapies; (iv) Polymer conjugation to a prodrug designed to be activated by specific enzymes overexpressed in tumors, Turning-ON a near infra-red (NIR) fluorescence signal.
When completed, this proposal will shed light on this fundamental cancer biology phenomenon.

Recent estimates indicate that the overall number of people with visual loss is 285 million globally, of whom 39 million are blind. In Europe, approximately 1 in 30 individuals experience sight loss and 75% of those are unemployed, a social burden which is anticipated to double by 2020 as the population of Europe ages. Diseases affecting the retina, the light sensitive extension of the central nervous system lining the back of the eye, account for approximately 26% of blindness. To date, there are no treatments to restore lost retinal cells and visual function and there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. A pioneering breakthrough has highlighted the possibility of generating synthetic retinae from stem cells under laboratory conditions. This research is in its infancy and needs to be developed so human synthetic retinae can be produced efficiently and reproducibly from patient-specific stem cells. Very recently, my group has developed a unique method that results in conversion of human embryonic stem cells to fully laminated retinae containing all retinal cell types under laboratory conditions. In this project we aim: (1) to develop a robust differentiation method for generation of synthetic retinae that can be applied efficiently to a large number of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells; (2) to  investigate that laboratory derived synthetic retinae contain functional retinal cells which are equivalent to native cells arising during human development and can contribute to restoration of vision upon transplantation into degenerate retinae and (3) to develop preclinical tools that will enable us to select functional retinal cells for cell replacement therapies in humans.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,599,857</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RNAiMMUNITY"><Rcn>192002</Rcn><Nid>10714</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Dynamics of the RNAi-mediated antiviral immunity</Name><PI>Maria Carla Saleh Bottegoni</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific, gene-silencing mechanism that is induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Double-stranded RNA is commonly generated during viral replication and is considered to be a molecular pattern associated with viral infection. Our previous work demonstrated that viral infections in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are countered by an antiviral RNAi response: the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway is the major antiviral defence mechanism in insects. Recently, another RNAi pathway was also suggested to be involved in antiviral defence, the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway.
The field of insect immunity has been largely dominated by studies on antimicrobial immunity, while antiviral immunity has received relatively little attention. Based on a combination of basic and applied science as well as bioinformatic approaches, we propose to investigate the molecular and cellular aspects underlying the immune dynamics of the antiviral response. We want to uncover fully the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in insects and its main attributes, such as memory, long-lasting immunity, specificity, and effect on the virus.

While there is ample evidence from model systems that small RNAs are the lynchpin of powerful mechanisms that silence transcription, the demonstration of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) mediated by a small RNA in humans is lacking. We have recently shown that the HIV-1 LTR is controlled by premature termination of transcription and TGS mediated by a small RNA derived from the stem-loop structure, TAR, that forms the 5&#226;&#128;&#153; end of HIV-1 transcripts. This pathway depends on Microprocessor, Xrn2, Setx and Rrp6. Cleavage of TAR by Microprocessor has major consequences 1) it provides a substrate for Rrp6, which generates a small RNA that represses HIV-1 transcription, 2) it creates an entry site for Xrn2 and termination factors that lead to premature termination of transcription. Loss of Microprocessor or Rrp6 leads to recruitment of RNAPII to the LTR and activation of transcription. These findings not only provide the first evidence showing that small RNA-mediated TGS acts in human cells, but they also uncovered a new mechanism of gene regulation involving premature termination of transcription by RNAPII. Several important questions now need to be answered. What is the mechanism underlying small RNA-mediated TGS? Does small RNA-mediated TGS operate at human genes? What is the contribution of TGS coupled to premature termination in the global control of transcription? We will use a battery of biochemical and molecular approaches to dissect the molecular mechanism of RNA-mediated TGS. The global importance of small RNA-mediated TGS and premature termination of transcription in the control of human gene expression will be addressed using complementary genome-wide approaches. RNA-mediated TGS coupled to premature termination, if confirmed as a widespread mechanism controlling transcription, will fundamentally change our perspective of transcriptional control in humans</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,974</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RSHEALTH"><Rcn>185676</Rcn><Nid>10722</Nid><HI>Fundacion Centro Nacional De Investigaciones Oncologicas Carlos Iii, Spain</HI><Name>Investigating the causes and consequences of replication stress in mammalian health</Name><PI>Oscar Fernandez-Capetillo Ruiz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA damage (DD) is the cause of several diseases, including cancer, and it is also linked to the organ decline that arises in ageing. Yet, the contribution of different sources of DD to these processes is not understood. Sources of DD such as chromosome breaks, eroded telomeres or oxidative stress are been heavily investigated. For establishing my group, I decided to focus on a source of DD that arises every time a cell replicates its DNA, and which is known as replication stress (RS). In short, RS stands for the excessive accumulation of single-stranded DNA at replication forks that, due to its recombinogenic nature, can initiate genomic rearrangements. Consistently, RS is now known to be a key source of genomic instability in human tumors. In mammalian cells, a signalling cascade initiated by ATR and Chk1 kinases suppresses RS. Unfortunately, the essential nature of these kinases significantly limited the study of the RS-response in mammals. In the initial years of our lab we have developed several tools that facilitate the study of RS in mammals. These include a cellular system where ATR can be activated at will, potent and selective ATR inhibitors, and mice with reduced or increased levels of ATR and Chk1 kinases. These tools have allowed us to start exploring how RS impacts on cancer and ageing, as well as to investigate the potential of targeting ATR for cancer therapy. Yet, the field of RS is still poorly developed, and many basic questions are still in the need of answers.

This application outlines a plan for our research in the next five years, and explains how I propose to investigate RS at molecular, cellular and animal levels. Whereas I plan to capitalize on the tools (published and unpublished) that we have generated within the last few years, I also propose several innovative strategies for the study of the RS-response in mammals. This grant would allow us to consolidate our still young group as a solid laboratory for the study of RS in mammals."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,819</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RariTOR"><Rcn>192573</Rcn><Nid>13443</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>mTOR pathophysiology in rare human diseases</Name><PI>Mario Pende</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of growth. mTOR is a protein kinase that exists in two distinct complexes in the cell and transduces virtually all anabolic signals from the environment: nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, growth factor peptides, such as insulin and insulin like growth factors, oxygen, mitochondrial metabolites, energy status. mTOR is required to sustain cell responses to nutrient availability including cell growth, proliferation, macromolecule biosynthesis, and suppress autophagy. During the past ten years we have generated and characterized a wide panel of mouse mutants in the mTOR pathway. We were involved in revealing specific phenotypes that increased our knowledge of mTOR roles in pathophysiology: mutants with small cells, mutants resistant to tumorigenesis in specific tissues and after specific oncogenic insults, mutants mimicking caloric restriction and promoting longevity, mutants with muscle dystrophy, mutants with altered insulin action.
The overall goal of our research proposal for the next five years is twofold. From one hand we want to better understand fundamental processes including cell size control and organismal longevity. To this end we want to determine the molecular targets of the mTORC1/S6 kinase cassette that may explain the alterations in cell size and lifespan when these kinases are deregulated (project 1). From the other hand we want to understand and cure rare human genetic diseases that arise from pathological changes in the activity of the mTOR pathway in children or that may benefit from therapeutical intervention on this pathway. These diseases include Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, PEComas and hemangiomas (project 2), metabolic diseases (projects 3), lysosomal storage diseases (project 4).

A failure to maintain the integrity of replicating chromosomes leads to genome instability, an early event in tumorigenesis. Most common anti-cancer drugs also interfere with DNA synthesis, by largely undefined mechanisms. My lab specializes in the structural and molecular characterization of DNA replication stress in higher eukaryotes, combining standard cell and molecular biology with specialized single molecule analysis of replication intermediates.

The first aim of our research is to gain mechanistic information about the elusive impact of oncogene activation on DNA replication. By direct structural analysis of tissue culture models of tumorigenesis, we have recently uncovered specific defects in DNA synthesis associated with DNA damage checkpoint activation. We plan to expand these studies to compare the effect of different oncogenes and to identify cellular factors modulating oncogene-induced genotoxicity.

We are also elucidating the cytotoxic mechanisms of anti-cancer drugs that challenge DNA replication. Comparing the molecular consequences of chemotherapeutic treatments in control cells and cells lacking cancer-related factors, we plan to uncover how precisely different drugs interfere with replication and which cellular players mediate their cytotoxicity. We plan to complement these studies with a proteomic-based screen, to identify novel factors modulating replication of a damaged template.

Finally, we plan to analyze replication features in different populations of stem cells, as the cellular response to replication stress was recently proven essential for stem cell maintenance. We aim to provide mechanistic insight into the constitutive activation of the DNA damage response reported in embryonic stem cells. We also plan to expand these investigations to hematopoietic stem cells, where we recently observed similar phenomena upon stimuli-induced proliferation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,846,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SASATIN"><Rcn>111576</Rcn><Nid>11824</Nid><HI>University Of Strathclyde, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Soft and Small: Acoustic Transducers Inspired by Nature</Name><PI>James Frederick Charles Windmill</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The use of sound by humanity is ubiquitous. We utilise sound across a far greater range than we can hear for numerous extremely beneficial tasks. In Nature many animals have evolved ears, many of which are sensitive to sounds beyond human audibility. This includes an enormous variety of insects whose miniature ears detect sound to communicate, to detect their prey, or to avoid their own predators. Over recent years our understanding of the different insect ear functions, such as frequency filtering, analysis and tuning, has improved greatly. Insect ears can also be far more sensitive than equivalently sized artificial microphones, and have embedded &#226;&#128;&#152;active&#226;&#128;&#153; and  &#226;&#128;&#152;passive&#226;&#128;&#153; functions, for example to actively tune their response, or passively match impedance to ensure sensitivity. However, we still know very little about the mechanical and physiological basis behind these functions.

This project will use our knowledge of how insects hear to inspire the design and prototyping of artificial acoustic sensors. Existing microphones and ultrasonic devices have severe physical sensitivity limitations. This project seeks to change the fundamental approach to sensor design using inspiration from biology, such that previous limitations on size, functionality, power consumption, and robustness are avoided, whilst advancing fundamental understanding of the insect ear&#226;&#128;&#153;s sensing capacity.

We are particularly interested in answering fundamental questions about how the molecules that regulate gene expression and DNA replication operate in the intracellular environment. These questions include how transcription factors and RNA polymerases have evolved to rapidly find and bind their specific binding sites on chromosomal DNA, how the initiation of DNA replication is coordinated with cell growth, how cells can filter out leakage during replication of repressed genes, and other questions related to how the physical limitations of molecular interactions constrain cellular regulation.
Answering these questions requires better methods to study intracellular kinetics at high spatial and temporal resolution. For this purpose we will develop single-molecule methods to probe kinetics without perturbing the system. The project depends on development in five different fields (1) new labeling methods using unnatural amino acids, (2) new hardware solutions for single molecule tracking, (3) new microfluidic designs for controlled growth conditions and image analysis, (4) new computational tools to extract the maximal amount of information from many short single molecule trajectories and (5) accurate ways of computing synthetic microscopy images.
In addressing the specific questions stated above the experiments are necessarily combined with biophysical modeling that makes it possible to tell if the experimental results are expected from the previously known interactions and physical limitations due to for example stochasticity, slow diffusion and confined geometries. Overall the project is unique in its ambition to make a physically consistent quantitative description of central processes of life at the molecular level.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,398,823</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPERMDESTRUCT"><Rcn>188680</Rcn><Nid>12224</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Cellular Destruction Mechanisms that Create New Lives</Name><PI>Eli Arama</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Apoptosis, the major form of programmed cell death (PCD), is executed by caspases. However, activation of caspases can also promote a variety of vital cellular processes. Furthermore, cell death can sometimes proceed in the absence of apoptotic caspases by triggering alternative cell death (ACD) pathways. The main goal of my proposal is to delineate the molecular mechanisms, pathways and components underlying three distinct, evolutionarily conserved, cellular destruction processes, all associated with the Drosophila sperm life cycle, and to screen blood DNA samples from fertility clinics for mutations in human homologous genes. The first process, termed germ cell death (GCD), eliminates about 25% of the pre-meiotic germ cells through an ACD pathway. In the second process, the bulk cytoplasmic contents of the terminally differentiating spermatids are removed in a process called &#226;&#128;&#152;individualization&#226;&#128;&#153;, which involves active caspases. The third process occurs immediately after fertilization to selectively eliminate the sperm mitochondrial derivative. Similar cellular processes are also instrumental for the development and homeostasis of a variety of tissues and organs in essentially all multicellular organisms. Therefore, not only will this study enhance our understanding of male germ cell maturation and function, this unique system also provides an opportunity to study these important cellular processes using physiological conditions. The extraordinary degree of anatomical and molecular conservation of spermatogenesis in animals with flagellated sperm also signifies the extension of these studies to human patients. Although human infertility is a major health problem affecting 7% of men world-wide, we are still rather ignorant about the genetic causes of male infertility. My proposed approach, therefore, is feasible and efficient, and can overcome technical, practical, and ethical limitations associated with large-scale studies in humans.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPOT.COM"><Rcn>188676</Rcn><Nid>12230</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Evolution of a Drosophila wing pigmentation spot, a sexual communication system</Name><PI>Benjamin Prud'homme</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Explaining the origin of complex morphological innovations, in particular conspicuous male ornaments, remains one of the most challenging and exciting questions in the field of evolution. Indeed, conspicuous male-specific traits, either displayed to females during courtship, or used as weapons in battles, likely represent liabilities and should be opposed by natural selection. Darwin proposed that sexual selection is responsible for the evolution of these sexual traits. Since Darwin's time this hypothesis has received considerable theoretical and empirical support. Sexual selection is now perceived as a pervasive force shaping sexual communication systems, acting both on male signaling traits and female preference for these traits. Beyond this generic setup, however, the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of male ornaments, and the female preference for these traits, remain largely elusive.
The objective of this project is to decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of a sexual communication system in Drosophila species that have evolved a novel male-specific wing pigmentation pattern displayed to females during courtship. We will examine the emergence, the diversification, and the independent evolution of the male wing pigmentation pattern.
We will in particular (i) determine the genetic architecture underlying the formation of the male wing spot in Drosophila biarmipes; (ii) map the genetic sources of male wing spot divergence among species (shape, color, and intensity); (iii) identify the genetic and functional bases of the recurrent evolution of the wing spot, and (iv) characterize the nature of the female&#226;&#128;&#153;s reproductive preference.

Fifty years of intense research have revealed many key elements of the biology of this neurodegenerative disorder. However, our understanding of the molecular bases of the disease is still very limited, and the available medical treatments for AD are purely symptomatic and hardly effective. It is now clear that the modulation of a single target is unlikely to yield the desired outcome, and we should move from gene-centric to network-centric therapeutic strategies. In addition, we should focus on early (asymptomatic) phases of AD, before the brain damage is irreversible, and the identification of molecular biomarkers to monitor the response of patients is paramount.

Accordingly, the main objective of our proposal is the identification of novel biomarkers in AD to monitor the onset and progression of the pathology from very early stages, and to discover combinations of drug targets and chemical compounds able to modify the biology of the disease. We will first run proteomics and transcriptomics experiments, in AD mouse models, to reveal the organization of proteins and genes that are up- or down-regulated at different ages and AD stages, and their potential translocation into/out of mitochondria. We will then construct the AD-associated network, incorporating clinical data, which we will use as a framework for the integration and analyses of the &#226;&#128;&#147;omics data collected. We will transform the static data snapshots, corresponding to the different AD stages, into a dynamic model able to explain the progression of the disease, providing hints as to the best strategies to monitor and modulate AD evolution. We will finally design and validate a systems pharmacology strategy, based on concerted multi-target perturbations with small molecules, to modify the biology of the disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,296,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="THESEUS"><Rcn>189854</Rcn><Nid>11801</Nid><HI>The Francis Crick Institute Limited, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Tumour Heterogeneity and Somatic Evolution of Unstable cancer genomes</Name><PI>Robert Charles Swanton</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Summary
The majority of metastastic solid tumours remain incurable. In-depth analysis of tumour genomes is revealing evidence for branched evolution and cancer subclonal spatial and temporal intratumour heterogeneity (ITH). Drivers of ITH such as chromosomal instability (CIN) are associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. However, despite increasing knowledge of tumour diversity, there is limited insight into the mechanisms driving genomic instability and ITH or the processes that shape cancer genome evolution over time and space. Many animal tumour models fail to recapitulate patterns of genomic instability witnessed in human tumours, limiting insight into the forces that shape tumour evolution in vivo. We have found evidence for parallel subclonal evolution, resulting in the same gene or signal transduction pathway being subject to distinct inactivating or activating somatic events in different regions of the same tumour (Gerlinger NEJM 2012). These data suggest that in-depth analysis of tumour evolution may help define routes through which tumours must progress, offering opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches. We will develop new animal models of ITH, by developing knock-out strains for two suppressors of replication stress and CIN, recently identified in our laboratory (Burrell Nature 2013). These models will be used to study cancer evolution in order to decipher the impact of selection pressures, such as DNA damaging agents and cancer cytotoxics, on genomic complexity and diversity in emergent resistant subclones. In addition, through combined cancer informatics and functional genomics approaches we aim to identify novel mechanisms driving tumour heterogeneity and biological processes that permit the propagation of heterogeneous cells using novel transposon based approaches.

TOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and derivatives, are used clinically to treat cancer, cardio-vasculature disease and to prevent organ rejection.

We recently reported that both TORC1/2 are wired in feedback loops, where their downstream cellular effectors are at the same time upstream regulators.  It is this feedback loop that ultimately mediates the intrinsic role of TORC1/2 in cellular homeostasis:  TORC1/2 detects deviations from a steady-state condition and by means of these feedback loops returns the cell to its homeostatic situation.  We propose to systematically identify the TORC1/2 homeostatic signalling loops.  Subsequent characterization will focus on the signalling networks controlling intermediary metabolism.  Our ultimate goal is to comprehensively unravel the TORC1/2-dependent metabolic networks composed of regulatory feedback loops which will reveal the fundamental role of the TOR Complexes as molecular devices to achieve cellular homeostasis."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,991,686</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSLATE"><Rcn>185675</Rcn><Nid>12032</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Specificity of translational control during unfolded protein response</Name><PI>Jernej Ule</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated by multiple types of cellular stress, and can promote either cell survival or apoptosis. The balance between these opposing outcomes is delicately regulated, and when lost, contributes to diverse diseases. UPR enables cells to halt general translation, while inducing translation and transcription of specific mRNAs that escape repression. Even though the general machinery controlling translation is well understood, several fundamental open questions remain: 1) how are mRNAs selected for translation during UPR, 2) what role does mRNA structure and sequence play in this selection, 3) what role does UPR pathway play in the highly differentiated cells, such as neurons? My lab employs an integrative approach to understand how RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control specific mRNAs. We recently developed hiCLIP, a method that globally quantifies interactions between RBPs and double-stranded RNA in live cells. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that a double-stranded RBP binds to structured motifs in mRNAs to control stress-induced translation. I propose to determine how combinatorial recognition of RNA sequence and structure by RBPs controls mRNA localisation, stability and translation during UPR. In addition, we will assess the role of UPR pathway in neuronal differentiation. Taken together, this study aims to elucidate how cells select specific mRNAs for translation, and thereby survive during stress or respond to signals that control differentiation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,435</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRNAPROLIF"><Rcn>185635</Rcn><Nid>12339</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Control of translation efficiency in proliferating and differentiated mammalian cells</Name><PI>Yitzhak Pilpel</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Translation maps the transcriptome onto the proteome.

tRNAProlif offers an approach that consists of genome-wide measurements and analyses of the tRNA and mRNAs pools, and the interplay between them, in proliferative and differentiated cells. The project will explain how changes in translation affect, and are affected by, these two states.
We rely on our preliminary results that show a striking dichotomy in codon usage: genes involved in cellular proliferation have distinct codon usage compared to genes involved in differentiation and other multi-cellular process. Further, the tRNA pool consists of two distinct sub-populations: tRNAs whose codons are enriched among the proliferation genes are induced in proliferation and cancer, and tRNAs whose codons are enriched in differentiation genes are repressed in proliferation and are induced in differentiation. Towards understanding this &#226;&#128;&#156;tRNA Switch&#226;&#128;&#157; we aim at:
Causality: We will determine whether the tRNA pool affects the proliferation/differentiation status of cell. Conversely, we will determine the effects of the proliferation/differentiation status on the tRNA pool.

Among such physical cues, mechanical tension is emerging as central regulator of cellular fate and function. To explain tension regulation, current research emphasizes molecular mechanisms at an ever increasing level of detail. How these local mechanisms are integrated to give rise to global patterns of tissue tension is unknown, however. The goal of this project is to provide a multiscale understanding of tension regulation within epithelial cell monolayers. We propose two pairs of competing mechanisms for tension regulation: fluidization vs. reinforcement and cell division vs. apoptosis. These competing mechanisms are inherently multiscale in the sense that they span and couple multiple levels of tissue organization, from the local actomyosin contraction to the multicellular rearrangement. For each of these competing mechanisms we plan to study how local processes and interactions give rise to global tensional patterns. To do this, we propose to develop an integrated experimental setup to map and perturb monolayer tension at different length scales.

At a macroevolutionary scale this leads to the prediction that speciation is driven by the rate of trait evolution rather than the state of the trait. Despite the established theoretical links between trait evolution and speciation, most macroevolutionary studies focus on predicting speciation as a state dependent process. To date the hypothesis that rapid speciation is driven by rapid trait evolution has rarely been tested. If the rate or degree of divergence in species traits is an important factor in driving differences in speciation rates among lineages then there must also be variation in rates of trait evolution among lineages. Using my recently completed phylogeny of all extant birds, novel datasets of ecomorphological and secondary sexual traits, and computer simulations, I will carry out the first large-scale analyses to determine the extent to which rates of phenotypic evolution vary among lineages and across space, test the causes of non-constant evolutionary rates, and derive and test predictions on the effects of rates of trait evolution on speciation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,717,624</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TransMETH"><Rcn>188667</Rcn><Nid>12217</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Identification of novel functions and regulators of DNA methylation in mammals</Name><PI>Micha&#195;&#171;l Philippe Weber</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The development of complex organisms entails sequence-specific transcription factors and also epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. Methylation of DNA occurs on cytosines and can be transmitted over many cell generations to sustain epigenetic memory. Yet we still know very little about how DNA methylation is attracted to specific sites in the genome and how this ultimately influences cellular destiny. This is a fascinating challenge that deserves intensive investigations because DNA methylation is critical for both normal and pathological cellular functions.
I propose to initiate an ambitious research project that will identify novel functions and regulators of DNA methylation in the mouse. My objectives are to (1) use genome-wide mapping and elegant mouse genetics to elucidate the role of DNA methylation in lineage identity in physiological contexts in vivo; (2) design original high-throughput RNAi screens to identify novel factors that shape the DNA methylome in mammalian genomes; and (3) develop tools for targeted engineering of the methylome that will allow, for the first time, to test predictive models by interfering with DNA methylation at specific sites in the genome.
This combination of innovative approaches will lead to major breakthroughs that go beyond the current state-of-art. We will assess causal and mechanistic relationships between DNA methylation and cell identity at the genome level, and identify novel epigenetic regulators for long term studies to characterize their mechanism of action.

Therefore, many studies address the central transcriptional pathways that regulate cholesterol metabolism. However, transcriptional regulation does not allow cells to quickly adapt to the cholesterol fluxes that they encounter. For this, rapid and reversible post-transcriptional modifications are used, in conjunction with transcriptional control. Ubiquitylation - the post-transcriptional conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins &#226;&#128;&#147; is studied in relation to many cellular processes. Much less is known about the contribution of the ubiquitin-proteasomal-system (UPS) to regulation of lipid metabolism and development of cardiovascular disease.

I recently identified the E3-ubiquitin ligase IDOL as a novel post-transcriptional regulator of the LDLR pathway. My lab also recently identified two genes, the E3-ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 and the de-ubiquitylase USP2, for which no role in sterol metabolism was known, as important regulators of cellular cholesterol metabolism. With IDOL, these genes control key nodes of cholesterol synthesis and uptake and represent previously unrecognized mechanisms to control cholesterol homeostasis. To study the contribution of these genes to cholesterol metabolism, we will use state-of-the-art mutant mouse models, in vitro assays, and a unique collection of dyslipidemic patient material. Our goal is to characterize the contribution of these genes to cholesterol homeostasis and to examine their involvement in the development of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.

Investigating these novel regulatory systems will provide important mechanistic insight into the contribution of the UPS to cholesterol metabolism in health and disease. As components of the UPS are amenable to pharmacological manipulation these studies could potentially lead to novel targets for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UbInflam"><Rcn>192477</Rcn><Nid>13445</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Regulation of inflammasome activity through NLRP3 ubiquitination level</Name><PI>Benedicte Francoise Py</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The innate immunity constitutes an efficient barrier by rapidly detecting pathogens and tissue damages through pattern recognition receptors including NLRP3. On the other hand, inappropriate NLRP3 activation causes deleterious inflammation and contributes to various conditions including atherosclerosis, diabetes, gout and Alzheimer's diseases. Therefore NLRP3 requires tight regulation that remains poorly characterized. Activated NLRP3 assembles a multimeric inflammasome complex serving as activation platform for caspase-1 that controls processing and release of cytosolic cytokines including IL-1&#206;&#178;. We recently evidenced that inflammasome assembly requires NLRP3 deubiquitination by the deubiquitinase BRCC3. The aim of this proposal is to decipher this new ubiquitin-dependent regulatory pathway critical for NLRP3 activation. We propose to identify stimuli, signaling pathways and enzymatic complexes controlling NLRP3 ubiquitination level. Using both cell biology and biochemistry approaches, we will decipher the molecular mechanisms beneath the regulation of the deubiquitinase and ubiquitin ligase complex activity, as well as the loss of activity of ubiquitinated NLRP3. Lastly, we will test the in vivo relevance of NLRP3 ubiquitination using both mouse models, patients study and pharmacological approach. Altogether, this project will thoroughly characterize this new pathway controlling inflammasome activity and provide new therapeutic targets against inflammation related diseases that are highly prevalent in the European Union.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,933,724</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ViVARNAsilencing"><Rcn>185604</Rcn><Nid>12009</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Antiviral Defense in the Vector Mosquito Aedes aegypti: induction and suppression of RNA silencing pathways</Name><PI>Ronald Van Rij</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes and other blood-feeding arthropods transmit important human and animal viruses (arthropod-borne viruses, arboviruses). With the increasing global threat of arboviruses, it is essential to understand the virus-vector interactions that determine virus transmission. The mosquito antiviral immune response is a key determinant of virus replication and transmission. We recently showed that arboviruses are targeted by a poorly-understood RNA silencing pathway in the major vector mosquito Aedes aegypti: the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Our (published and unpublished) observations imply that the piRNA pathway contributes to antiviral defense against different classes of viruses in somatic tissues of mosquitoes. Moreover, we identified a novel class of endogenous gene-derived piRNAs in mosquitoes that may form a new paradigm for piRNA-based regulation of cellular gene expression.

AIM: This proposal has a three-fold aim: i) to delineate the biogenesis and function of the novel classes of virus- and gene-derived piRNAs, ii) to characterize mechanisms by which (arbo)viruses suppress or evade antiviral RNA silencing pathways, and by doing so, iii) to establish mosquitoes as an experimental model to characterize the complex piRNA machinery.

APPROACH: We will use Aedes cell lines that recapitulate all aspects of piRNA biogenesis. This allows us to use a unique, powerful approach of genomic, cell biological, biochemical, and proteomic methodologies to study piRNA biogenesis and function.

IMPORTANCE AND INNOVATION: This is the first study to comprehensively characterize viral and cellular piRNA biogenesis and function in mosquitoes. This proposal provides novel insights into the antiviral response in mosquitoes and may uncover novel regulatory functions of endogenous piRNAs. Moreover, it establishes a platform for functional and biochemical dissection of the complex biogenesis of piRNAs - the most enigmatic class of small silencing RNAs.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="WaterWalking"><Rcn>185626</Rcn><Nid>12015</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Water-walking insects: marrying evo-devo with ecology for a better understanding of morphological evolution</Name><PI>Abderrahman Khila</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding the origin of the remarkable biodiversity in nature is an important goal in biological studies. Despite recent advances in evolutionary developmental biology, our understanding of the interaction between developmental genetic processes and the ecological environment in shaping the phenotype remains largely fragmented. This is mainly because of the difficulty to transfer molecular genetic tools to natural systems where we have a good understanding of the ecology. In this proposal, we combine original natural systems, water-walking insects, with state of the art tools of functional and developmental genetics, to study the interplay between developmental genetic pathways and the ecological environment, and how this interaction can shape adaptive phenotypic change. About 200 million years ago, the common ancestor of water-walking insects (Heteroptera, Gerromorpha) invaded water surface and radiated into a diverse array of niches, from shorelines to open oceans. This ecological transition and specialization is associated with an array of adaptive changes that enabled these insects to support their body weight and generate efficient propulsion on the water surface.
In this project, we aim to develop a multilevel functional approach that combines developmental and evolutionary genetics, ecology, and comparative genomics and transcriptomics, to study a set of key morphological traits directly associated with the initial event of transition to water surface life, and the diversification that followed. To achieve this, we chose three water-walking insects, along with a terrestrial and under-water outgroups, based on their morphology, ecology, and amenability for laboratory culturing and functional experiments. We will identify the genes and genetic changes responsible for the development and evolution of the hydrophobic bristles &#226;&#128;&#147;a key trait that was instrumental in the transition from terrestrial to water surface life.

To determine how these bio-molecules assemble into a highly organized molecular system has remained a major challenge. Here, we aim to unravel how dozens of proteins assemble into a large molecular machinery that degrades mRNA in an efficient and regulated manner.

On an atomic level, we will determine the static structures of the enzymes involved in the mRNA degradation pathways. In parallel, we will develop and exploit novel methods in NMR spectroscopy to correlate molecular motions with catalytic activity. Especially for the 450 kDa eukaryotic exosome complex, these studies will significantly push the limits of what is currently achievable. On a molecular level, we will reconstitute the mRNA degradation machinery from purified components in a stepwise manner. In this challenging approach, we will use NMR spectroscopy to follow how the enzymes engage in a network of interactions that regulate the mRNA degradation process. These studies will also provide us with the unique possibility to reproduce complex cellular behavior in a well defined and easy to manipulate in vitro system. On a microscopic level the mRNA degradation machinery assembles into cytoplasmic processing bodies. The role of these conserved cellular foci is a matter of debate and we aim to determine both the atomic details that result in this self-organization as well as the catalytic advantages that result from this clustering.

Our study will provide a very detailed and accurate description of how essential and central molecular processes in mRNA degradation are regulated and modulated. The level of detail that we aim to achieve is currently not available for any cellular pathway of such complexity. In that regard, our projects also provide knowledge and methodology required to study additional and complex cellular functions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,966,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="15CBOOKTRADE"><Rcn>185561</Rcn><Nid>12345</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The 15th-century Book Trade: An Evidence-based Assessment and Visualization of the Distribution, Sale, and Reception of Books in the Renaissance</Name><PI>Cristina Dondi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The idea that underpins this project is to use the material evidence from thousands of surviving 15th-c. books, as well as unique documentary evidence &#226;&#128;&#148; the unpublished ledger of a Venetian bookseller in the 1480s which records the sale of 25,000 printed books with their prices &#226;&#128;&#148; to address four fundamental questions relating to the introduction of printing in the West which have so far eluded scholarship, partly because of lack of evidence, partly because of the lack of effective tools to deal with existing evidence. The book trade differs from other trades operating in the medieval and early modern periods in that the goods traded survive in considerable numbers. Not only do they survive, but many of them bear stratified evidence of their history in the form of marks of ownership, prices, manuscript annotations, binding and decoration styles. A British Academy pilot project conceived by the PI produced a now internationally-used database which gathers together this kind of evidence for thousands of surviving 15th-c. printed books. For the first time, this makes it possible to track the circulation of books, their trade routes and later collecting, across Europe and the USA, and throughout the centuries. The objectives of this project are to examine (1) the distribution and trade-routes, national and international, of 15th-c. printed books, along with the identity of the buyers and users (private, institutional, religious, lay, female, male, and by profession) and their reading practices; (2) the books' contemporary market value; (3) the transmission and dissemination of the texts they contain, their survival and their loss (rebalancing potentially skewed scholarship); and (4) the circulation and re-use of the illustrations they contain. Finally, the project will experiment with the application of scientific visualization techniques to represent, geographically and chronologically, the movement of 15th-c. printed books and of the texts they contain.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,172</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACQDIV"><Rcn>191230</Rcn><Nid>10607</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Acquisition processes in maximally diverse languages: Min(d)ing the ambient language</Name><PI>Sabine Erika Stoll</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Children learn any language that they grow up with, adapting to any of the ca. 7000 languages of the world, no matter how divergent or complex their structures are. What cognitive processes make this extreme flexibility possible? This is one of the most burning questions in cognitive science and the ACQDIV project aims at answering it by testing and refining the following leading hypothesis: Language acquisition is flexible and adaptive to any kind of language because it relies on a small set of universal cognitive processes that variably target different structures at different times during acquisition in every language. The project aims at establishing the precise set of processes and at determining the conditions of variation across maximally diverse languages. This project focuses on three processes: (i) distributional learning, (ii) generalization-based learning and (iii) interaction-based learning. To investigate these processes I will work with a sample of five clusters of languages including longitudinal data of two languages each. The clusters were determined by a clustering algorithm seeking the structurally most divergent languages in a typological database. The languages are: Cluster 1: Slavey and Cree, Cluster 2: Indonesian and Yucatec, Cluster 3: Inuktitut and Chintang, Cluster 4: Sesotho and Russian, Cluster 5: Japanese and Turkish. For all languages, corpora are available, except for Slavey where fieldwork is planned. The leading hypothesis will be tested against the acquisition of aspect and negation in each language of the sample and also against the two structures in each language that are most salient and challenging in them (e. g. complex morphology in Chintang). The acquisition processes also depend on statistical patterns in the input children receive. I will examine these patterns across the sample with respect to repetitiveness effects, applying data-mining methods and systematically comparing child-directed and child-surrounding speech."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADaPt"><Rcn>189849</Rcn><Nid>11805</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype: understanding the roles of climate, natural selection and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer adaptability</Name><PI>Jay Stock</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Relative to other species, humans are characterised by considerable biological diversity despite genetic homogeneity. This diversity is reflected in skeletal variation, but we lack sufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms to adequately interpret the archaeological record. The proposed research will address problems in our current understanding of the origins of human variation in the past by: 1) documenting and interpreting the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation relative to genetic phylogenies and climatic variation; 2) testing the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation among genetically related hunter-gatherers from different environments; 3) examining the adaptability of living humans to different environments, through the study of energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs associated with locomotion; and 4) investigating the relationship between muscle and skeletal variation associated with locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved by linking: a) detailed study of the global pattern of hunter-gatherer variation in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene with; b) ground-breaking experimental research which tests the relationship between energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans. The first component tests the correspondence between skeletal variation and both genetic and climatic history, to infer mechanisms driving variation. The second component integrates this skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans to, for the first time, directly test adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. ADaPt will provide the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics that may have shaped our success as a species. It will lead to breakthroughs necessary to interpret variation in the archaeological record, relative to human dispersals and adaptation in the past.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,911,485</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="APARTHEID-STOPS"><Rcn>185596</Rcn><Nid>11991</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>"Apartheid-- The Global Itinerary: South African Cultural Formations in Transnational Circulation, 1948-1990"</Name><PI>Louise Bethlehem</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal proceeds from an anomaly. Apartheid routinely breached the separation that it names. Whereas the South African regime was deeply isolationist in international terms, new research links it to the Cold War and decolonization. Yet this trend does not consider sufficiently that the global contest over the meaning of apartheid and resistance to it occurs on the terrain of culture. My project argues that studying the global circulation of South African cultural formations in the apartheid era provides novel historiographic leverage over Western liberalism during the Cold War. It recasts apartheid as an apparatus of transnational cultural production, turning existing historiography inside out. This study seeks:
&#8226; To provide the first systematic account of the deterritorialization of &#8220;apartheid&#8221;&#8212;as political signifier and as apparatus generating circuits of transnational cultural production.
&#8226; To analyze these itinerant cultural formations across media and national borders, articulating new intersections.
&#8226; To map the itineraries of major South African exiles, where exile is taken to be a system of interlinked circuits of affiliation and cultural production.
&#8226; To revise the historiography of states other than South Africa through the lens of deterritorialized apartheid-era formations at their respective destinations.
&#8226; To show how apartheid reveals contradictions within Western liberalism during the Cold War, with special reference to racial inequality.
Methodologically, I introduce the model of thick convergence to analyze three periods:
1. Kliptown &amp; Bandung: Novel possibilities, 1948-1960.
2. Sharpeville &amp; Memphis: Drumming up resistance, 1960-1976.
3. From Soweto to Berlin: Spectacle at the barricades, 1976-1990.

This question is facing statisticians as they grapple with standardising national census methods so that their numbers can be assembled into a European population. Yet, by so doing&#8212;intentionally or otherwise&#8212;they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.

Why is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'

ARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago. At the same time it will attend to how these practices affect the constitution of who are the people of Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,833,649</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINandMINDFULNESS"><Rcn>192255</Rcn><Nid>13231</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Impact of Mental Training of Attention and Emotion Regulation on Brain and Behavior: Implications for Neuroplasticity, Well-Being and Mindfulness Psychotherapy Research</Name><PI>Antoine Lutz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Mindfulness-based therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment to reduce stress, increase well-being and prevent relapse in depression. A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#8217;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development. Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving.
I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks.
Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate.
Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,121</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CARP"><Rcn>189856</Rcn><Nid>10800</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Making Selves, Making Revolutions: Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics"</Name><PI>Martin Holbraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"What kinds of self does it take to make a revolution?

Developing a comparative matrix of revolutionary settings in the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, CARP&#8217;s core objective is to investigate the differing permutations and dynamics of revolutionary &#8216;anthropologies&#8217; in the original theological sense of the term, i.e. charting revolutionary politics in relation to varying conceptions of what it is to be human, and of how the horizons of people&#8217;s lives are to be understood in relation to divine orders of different kinds, in order to reveal how revolutions come to define what persons may be, deliberately setting the social, political, cultural and ultimately ontological coordinates within which people are made who they are. Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix. Providing much-needed empirical materials and analytical insight into the dynamic comingling of political and religious forms in the making of revolutionary selves, CARP&#8217;s ultimate ambition is to launch the comparative study of revolutionary politics as a major new departure for anthropological research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,854,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRODE"><Rcn>185583</Rcn><Nid>11387</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit&#228;t Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Corroding the social?

The project&#8217;s core goal is to provide empirical estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on four critical domains of social life, namely household incomes, demographic behaviour, educational attainment, as well as social integration and civic participation. The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level.

The book trade differs from other trades operating in the medieval and early modern periods in that the goods traded survive in considerable numbers. Not only do they survive, but many of them bear stratified evidence of their history in the form of marks of ownership, prices, manuscript annotations, binding and decoration styles. A British Academy pilot project conceived by the PI produced a now internationally-used database which gathers together this kind of evidence for thousands of surviving 15th-c. printed books. For the first time, this makes it possible to track the circulation of books, their trade routes and later collecting, across Europe and the USA, and throughout the centuries. The objectives of this project are to examine (1) the distribution and trade-routes, national and international, of 15th-c. printed books, along with the identity of the buyers and users (private, institutional, religious, lay, female, male, and by profession) and their reading practices; (2) the books' contemporary market value; (3) the transmission and dissemination of the texts they contain, their survival and their loss (rebalancing potentially skewed scholarship); and (4) the circulation and re-use of the illustrations they contain. Finally, the project will experiment with the application of scientific visualization techniques to represent, geographically and chronologically, the movement of 15th-c. printed books and of the texts they contain.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,172</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACQDIV"><Rcn>191230</Rcn><Nid>10607</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Acquisition processes in maximally diverse languages: Min(d)ing the ambient language</Name><PI>Sabine Erika Stoll</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Children learn any language that they grow up with, adapting to any of the ca. 7000 languages of the world, no matter how divergent or complex their structures are. What cognitive processes make this extreme flexibility possible? This is one of the most burning questions in cognitive science and the ACQDIV project aims at answering it by testing and refining the following leading hypothesis: Language acquisition is flexible and adaptive to any kind of language because it relies on a small set of universal cognitive processes that variably target different structures at different times during acquisition in every language. The project aims at establishing the precise set of processes and at determining the conditions of variation across maximally diverse languages. This project focuses on three processes: (i) distributional learning, (ii) generalization-based learning and (iii) interaction-based learning. To investigate these processes I will work with a sample of five clusters of languages including longitudinal data of two languages each. The clusters were determined by a clustering algorithm seeking the structurally most divergent languages in a typological database. The languages are: Cluster 1: Slavey and Cree, Cluster 2: Indonesian and Yucatec, Cluster 3: Inuktitut and Chintang, Cluster 4: Sesotho and Russian, Cluster 5: Japanese and Turkish. For all languages, corpora are available, except for Slavey where fieldwork is planned. The leading hypothesis will be tested against the acquisition of aspect and negation in each language of the sample and also against the two structures in each language that are most salient and challenging in them (e. g. complex morphology in Chintang). The acquisition processes also depend on statistical patterns in the input children receive. I will examine these patterns across the sample with respect to repetitiveness effects, applying data-mining methods and systematically comparing child-directed and child-surrounding speech."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADaPt"><Rcn>189849</Rcn><Nid>11805</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype: understanding the roles of climate, natural selection and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer adaptability</Name><PI>Jay Stock</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Relative to other species, humans are characterised by considerable biological diversity despite genetic homogeneity. This diversity is reflected in skeletal variation, but we lack sufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms to adequately interpret the archaeological record. The proposed research will address problems in our current understanding of the origins of human variation in the past by: 1) documenting and interpreting the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation relative to genetic phylogenies and climatic variation; 2) testing the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation among genetically related hunter-gatherers from different environments; 3) examining the adaptability of living humans to different environments, through the study of energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs associated with locomotion; and 4) investigating the relationship between muscle and skeletal variation associated with locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved by linking: a) detailed study of the global pattern of hunter-gatherer variation in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene with; b) ground-breaking experimental research which tests the relationship between energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans. The first component tests the correspondence between skeletal variation and both genetic and climatic history, to infer mechanisms driving variation. The second component integrates this skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans to, for the first time, directly test adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. ADaPt will provide the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics that may have shaped our success as a species. It will lead to breakthroughs necessary to interpret variation in the archaeological record, relative to human dispersals and adaptation in the past.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,911,485</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="APARTHEID-STOPS"><Rcn>185596</Rcn><Nid>11991</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>"Apartheid-- The Global Itinerary: South African Cultural Formations in Transnational Circulation, 1948-1990"</Name><PI>Louise Bethlehem</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal proceeds from an anomaly. Apartheid routinely breached the separation that it names. Whereas the South African regime was deeply isolationist in international terms, new research links it to the Cold War and decolonization. Yet this trend does not consider sufficiently that the global contest over the meaning of apartheid and resistance to it occurs on the terrain of culture. My project argues that studying the global circulation of South African cultural formations in the apartheid era provides novel historiographic leverage over Western liberalism during the Cold War. It recasts apartheid as an apparatus of transnational cultural production, turning existing historiography inside out. This study seeks:
&#226;&#128;&#162; To provide the first systematic account of the deterritorialization of &#226;&#128;&#156;apartheid&#226;&#128;&#157;&#226;&#128;&#148;as political signifier and as apparatus generating circuits of transnational cultural production.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To analyze these itinerant cultural formations across media and national borders, articulating new intersections.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To map the itineraries of major South African exiles, where exile is taken to be a system of interlinked circuits of affiliation and cultural production.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To revise the historiography of states other than South Africa through the lens of deterritorialized apartheid-era formations at their respective destinations.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To show how apartheid reveals contradictions within Western liberalism during the Cold War, with special reference to racial inequality.
Methodologically, I introduce the model of thick convergence to analyze three periods:
1. Kliptown &amp; Bandung: Novel possibilities, 1948-1960.
2. Sharpeville &amp; Memphis: Drumming up resistance, 1960-1976.
3. From Soweto to Berlin: Spectacle at the barricades, 1976-1990.
Each explores a cultural dominant in the form of texts, soundscapes or photographs.

This question is facing statisticians as they grapple with standardising national census methods so that their numbers can be assembled into a European population. Yet, by so doing&#226;&#128;&#148;intentionally or otherwise&#226;&#128;&#148;they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.

Why is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'

ARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago. At the same time it will attend to how these practices affect the constitution of who are the people of Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,833,649</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINandMINDFULNESS"><Rcn>192255</Rcn><Nid>13231</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Impact of Mental Training of Attention and Emotion Regulation on Brain and Behavior: Implications for Neuroplasticity, Well-Being and Mindfulness Psychotherapy Research</Name><PI>Antoine Lutz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Mindfulness-based therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment to reduce stress, increase well-being and prevent relapse in depression. A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#226;&#128;&#153;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development. Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving.
I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks.
Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate.
Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,121</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CARP"><Rcn>189856</Rcn><Nid>10800</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Making Selves, Making Revolutions: Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics"</Name><PI>Martin Holbraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"What kinds of self does it take to make a revolution? And how does revolutionary politics, understood as a project of personal as much as political transformation, articulate with other processes of self-making, such as religious practices?

Developing a comparative matrix of revolutionary settings in the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, CARP&#226;&#128;&#153;s core objective is to investigate the differing permutations and dynamics of revolutionary &#226;&#128;&#152;anthropologies&#226;&#128;&#153; in the original theological sense of the term, i.e. charting revolutionary politics in relation to varying conceptions of what it is to be human, and of how the horizons of people&#226;&#128;&#153;s lives are to be understood in relation to divine orders of different kinds, in order to reveal how revolutions come to define what persons may be, deliberately setting the social, political, cultural and ultimately ontological coordinates within which people are made who they are. Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix. Providing much-needed empirical materials and analytical insight into the dynamic comingling of political and religious forms in the making of revolutionary selves, CARP&#226;&#128;&#153;s ultimate ambition is to launch the comparative study of revolutionary politics as a major new departure for anthropological research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,854,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRODE"><Rcn>185583</Rcn><Nid>11387</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit&#195;&#164;t Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Corroding the social?

The project&#226;&#128;&#153;s core goal is to provide empirical estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on four critical domains of social life, namely household incomes, demographic behaviour, educational attainment, as well as social integration and civic participation. The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level. To achieve robust causal inference, the project utilizes multilevel panel data modelling, notably two-way fixed-effects and related estimators that statistically control for unobserved heterogeneity at both the household and contextual level."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,876,758</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ChinaCreative"><Rcn>191352</Rcn><Nid>11887</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>From Made in China to Created in China- A Comparative Study of Creative Practice and Production in Contemporary China</Name><PI>Bastiaan Jeroen De Kloet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>With its emergence as a global power, China aspires to move from a &#226;&#128;&#156;made in China&#226;&#128;&#157; towards a &#226;&#128;&#156;created in China&#226;&#128;&#157; country.

Furthermore, high quality spatially explicit information on land cover change is an essential input variable to land use change modelling, which is increasingly being used to better understand the potential impact of certain policies. The amount of observed land cover change also serves as an important indicator of how well different regional, national and European policies have been implemented.

However, outside Europe and outside the developed world in particular, information on land cover and land cover change in poorer countries is hardly available and no national or regional dense sample based monitoring approaches such as LUCAS exists which deliver sufficiently accurate land cover and land cover change information. Moreover in particular in developing countries, there is no or very little information on land-use and crop management. Only very limited data available from FAO and an incomplete coverage of sub-national statistics (e.g. IFPRI) are available.

This research project will assess the potential of using crowdsourcing to close these big data gaps in developing and developed countries with a number of case studies and different data collection methods.

Their outputs form a key component in guidance underpinning government and industry decisions on changes to policy, infrastructure developments or the introduction of new services or products. Given the significant financial, environmental and societal implications of such decisions, model accuracy is crucial. Current models however, while powerful and flexible, still present a highly abstract representation of consumer decisions. This project aims to develop a new framework which realigns modelled behaviour with real world behaviour, jointly representing the choice of multiple options or products and the quantity of consumption for each of these. In contrast with existing work, these choices will be placed within a wider framework, incorporating links between long term decisions and day to day choices, accounting for the growing importance of virtual social networks and the role of joint decisions. The work will ensure consistency with economic theory and in particular deal with the formation and role of budgets and constraints. While many developments will take place within the random utility framework, the project will also operationalize alternative theories of behaviour, such as non-compensatory decision rules from mathematical psychology. To ensure the transition of methodological developments into practice, I will test the models and illustrate their advantages in a large scale application studying the relationship between long term decisions and short term energy consumption. I will ensure that the models can produce output suitable for economic analysis and will develop free estimation software.

The spatial concentration of poverty within cities is of great concern to national governments, partly based on a belief in neighbourhood effects: the idea that living in deprived neighbourhoods has an additional negative effect on residents&#226;&#128;&#153; life chances over and above the effect of their own characteristics. This belief has contributed to the development of area-based policies designed to introduce a more &#226;&#128;&#152;favourable&#226;&#128;&#153; socio-economic mix in deprived neighbourhoods. Despite the persistent belief in neighbourhood effects, there is surprisingly little evidence that living in deprived neighbourhoods really affects individual lives. There is little consensus on the importance of neighbourhood effects, the underlying causal mechanisms, the conditions under which they are important and the most effective policy responses. It is likely that most studies claiming to have found that poor neighbourhoods make people poor(er) only show that poor people live in poor neighbourhoods because they cannot afford to live elsewhere. DEPRIVEDHOODS will break new ground by simultaneously studying neighbourhood sorting over the life course, neighbourhood change, and neighbourhood effects, within one theoretical and analytical framework. This project will be methodologically challenging and will be the first integrated, multi-country research project on neighbourhood effects to use unique geo-referenced longitudinal data from Sweden, United Kingdom, Estonia, and The Netherlands. Special attention will be paid to the operationalization of neighbourhoods and how it affects modelling outcomes. Through its integrated and international approach, DEPRIVEDHOODS will fundamentally advance understandings of the ways in which individual outcomes interact with the neighbourhood, which will ultimately lead to more targeted and effective policy measures."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,506</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ENLIFE"><Rcn>185634</Rcn><Nid>12324</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Engineering life: ideas, practices and promises</Name><PI>Jane Calvert</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The emerging field of synthetic biology promises to engineer the living world.

Its two objectives are: to investigate the movement of ideas, practices and promises from engineering into the life sciences, and to examine the ways in which social scientists and other groups are being mobilised as part of this endeavour.

We will carry out novel social scientific research into the engineering of living things, by collecting a rich body of empirical data. This will involve semi-structured qualitative interviews, participant observation at conferences, and ethnographic research in synthetic biology laboratories that are attempting to make biology easier to engineer. We will simultaneously address the interdisciplinary entanglements that arise in all these contexts, which involve scientists, engineers, social scientists, philosophers, lawyers and sometimes even artists and designers. We will also run four experimental interdisciplinary workshops, where we will explore the possibility of producing new knowledge together, across disciplinary divides.

The project aims to provide a critical, empirically grounded analysis of a field that promises to drive the next industrial revolution and is currently the target of high levels of investment across the globe. It will also provide insights into the engineering imagination, how it is applied to living things, and how it is challenged and expanded in interdisciplinary interactions. The study of these interactions will build on our understanding of the role of the social sciences in interdisciplinary collaborations, and contribute to pressing debates about the future of Science and Technology Studies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,559,389</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ERADICATION"><Rcn>192251</Rcn><Nid>13233</Nid><HI>Fondation Pour L Institut De Hautes Etudes Internationales Et Du Developpement, Switzerland</HI><Name>Eradication: the science and politics of a world without AIDS</Name><PI>Vinh-Kim Nguyen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>New biomedical technologies and public health strategies are being tested world-wide with the goal of eradicating the HIV epidemic. Achieving a world without AIDS has become the flagship of the vast global health apparatus, rallying governments, international organisations, philanthropic and pharmaceutical capital, research networks and activists. Mass screening and treatment, preventive drugs and gels, and molecular maps of sexual networks have shifted the biomedical paradigm from one of control to one of eradication. The biopolitical armamentarium of the push to eradicate may inadvertently enable unexpected biological, cultural, social and political transformations. Mass treatment and preventive drugs require very high levels of compliance to achieve the desired public health effects, foreshadowing the coercive potential of eradication efforts. Intensified mapping of &#226;&#128;&#156;most at-risk populations&#226;&#128;&#157; marks a shift from the existing emphasis on rights and empowerment to one of surveillance and discipline. As these approaches remain unproven, eradication constitutes a global public health experiment of unprecedented proportions, whose outcomes will shape global health efforts for decades to come. Eradication efforts to rid the world of HIV are attempts to order nature as revealed through a global epidemic, putting them squarely at the centre of anthropological concern. The two overarching questions are: what will HIV eradication efforts achieve? What are the reasons for the outcome, be it partial success or partial failure? To answer these questions, a multi-sited ethnography will be conducted in Africa, Europe and North America of the science and politics of HIV eradication. It will focus on the testing, preparation, and implementation of the three key technologies of HIV eradication: universal testing and mass treatment, molecular mapping of sexual and social networks.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,980</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXPECT HEAL-TH"><Rcn>191236</Rcn><Nid>11901</Nid><HI>Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>Empowering expectations for health and disease: training the immune and endocrine system</Name><PI>Andrea Evers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Expectations about health and disease induce immune and endocrine responses and directly affect health and treatment outcomes. However, there is an urge to understand the mechanical underpinnings how expectations affect immune and endocrine responses and how this knowledge can be used for therapeutic interventions.
My research group studies the main expectancy learning mechanisms for itch and pain as a generic expectancy model across symptoms and conditions. We recently showed that dual expectancy learning processes (i.e. conditioning and suggestions) are most powerful for itch symptoms, corresponding with findings for other symptoms and conditions. Based on these studies, I propose a groundbreaking dual expectancy learning approach, testing whether combined expectancy learning processes (i.e. both conditioning and suggestions, offered with personalized cues and exposure to relevant stressors) affect most profoundly the immune and endocrine system, in turn affecting health and disease outcomes.
The major aim is to unravel the central mechanisms of how peoples&#226;&#128;&#153; expectations affect immune and endocrine responses and related health outcomes, through the use of pioneering multidisciplinary methods in healthy and clinical populations. First, we systematically train immune and endocrine responses and relate them to psychological, neurobiological and genetic mechanisms. Second, we test these manipulations for physical health challenges (e.g. inflammatory or allergic histamine reactions) in healthy subjects and patients. Third, we study the long-term effects in chronic inflammatory itch and pain conditions (e.g. replacing anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapies, reducing side effects).
This interdisciplinary, cross-boundary project progresses key theoretical knowledge of the central expectation mechanisms for immune and endocrine responses. Findings open new horizons for  health prevention and therapeutic interventions for various inflammatory conditions and physical symptoms.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,981,009</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Emerging Subjects"><Rcn>188675</Rcn><Nid>11362</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Emerging Subjects of the New Economy: Tracing Economic Growth in Mongolia</Name><PI>Rebecca Anna Empson Mannerfelt</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project examines how predicted economic growth is experienced by people in Mongolia with the advent of large-scale mining operations. Our project will generate new insight into two areas of concern for economic anthropology and beyond.  First we will examine the way that the economy is unfolding in a distinct way in East Asia through different kinds of predictive narratives that come to have an effect on the way people act. Second we will explore how individual subjects also shape the economy in their everyday relations through various forms of exchange and the accumulation of wealth.

This dual focus provides the basis for a nuanced and powerful critique of our understanding of the way in which economic realities are shaped through predictive narratives as well as formed, from the ground-up, by local actors who carve out new forms of subjectivity through such actions. Indeed it is our suggestion that these new subjects of the growing economy are distinctly different from the post-socialist selves described in previous literature on the region. Instead they are powerful and hopeful subjects who demand a different kind of engagement and entitlement. The form such engagement takes and the kind of economic realities produced out of such forms is the focus of our study.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,658,373</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Forecasting"><Rcn>185600</Rcn><Nid>12332</Nid><HI>Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain</HI><Name>New Methods and Applications for Forecast Evaluation</Name><PI>Barbara Rossi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Forecasting is a fundamental tool in Economics, Statistics, Business and other sciences. Judging whether forecasts are good and robust is of great importance since forecasts are used everyday to guide policymakers' and practitioners' decisions. The proposal aims at addressing four important issues that researchers encounter in practice.

A first issue is how to assess whether forecasts are optimal in the presence of instabilities. Optimality is an important property of models&#226;&#128;&#153; forecasts: if forecasts are not optimal, then the model can be improved. Existing methods to assess forecast optimality are not robust to the presence of instabilities, which are widespread in the data. How to obtain such robust methods and what they tell us about widely used economic models&#226;&#128;&#153; forecasts is the first task of this project.

A second problem faced by forecasters in practice is to evaluate density forecasts. Density forecasts are important tools for policymakers since they quantify uncertainty around forecasts. However, existing methodologies focus on a null hypothesis that is not necessarily the one of interest to the forecaster. The second task is to develop tests for forecast density evaluation that address forecasters&#226;&#128;&#153; needs.

A third, important question is &#226;&#128;&#156;Why Do We Use Forecast Tests To Evaluate Models&#226;&#128;&#153; Performance?&#226;&#128;&#157;. The third task of this project is to understand the relationship between traditional in-sample and forecast evaluation tests, and develop a framework that helps to understand under which circumstances forecast tests are more useful than typical in-sample tests.

A final question is how researchers can improve models that do not forecast well. Model misspecification is widespread, still economists are often left wondering exactly which parts of their models are misspecified. The fourth task is to propose an empirical framework for addressing this issue. By estimating time-varying wedges, we assess where misspecification is located, and how important it is.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>501,860</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GBR"><Rcn>185658</Rcn><Nid>12024</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genius before Romanticism: Ingenuity in Early Modern Art and Science</Name><PI>Alexander John Marr</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Genius before Romanticism: Ingenuity in Early Modern Art and Science

What existed in the European imagination before the Romantic concept of &#226;&#128;&#152;genius&#226;&#128;&#153;?  This five-year project will examine notions of unique talent, heightened imagination and extraordinary creativity in art and science by exploring the language, theories, practices and products of ingenium (ingenuity) ca. 1450-ca. 1750.  Drawing on the perspectives of history of art, history of science, technology and medicine, intellectual history and literary studies, the project seeks to capture ingenuity across and between disciplines.  Studying five countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and England) across three centuries, it will trace ingenuity&#226;&#128;&#153;s shifting patterns and fragmented fortunes over the longue dur&#195;&#169;e.

Research will be conducted in four strands, focused on distinctive but interrelated aspects of ingenuity.  Strand 1, The &#226;&#128;&#152;Language of Ingenuity&#226;&#128;&#153;, will chart the word history of the ingenuity family of terms.  Strand 2, &#226;&#128;&#152;Conceptualizing Ingenuity&#226;&#128;&#153;, will explore the intellectual framework of ingenuity through its theoretical treatment in natural philosophy and artistic theory.  Strand 3, &#226;&#128;&#152;Ingenuity in the Making&#226;&#128;&#153;, will examine the cunning knowledge of ingenious craftsmen and the properties of &#226;&#128;&#152;spirited&#226;&#128;&#153; materials.  Strand 4, &#226;&#128;&#152;Ingenious Images&#226;&#128;&#153;, will investigate the visual culture of ingenuity, from the iconography of ingenium to the witty disingenuousness of optical games.

The findings of the project team will be disseminated to a scholarly audience and the wider public through monographs, volumes of essays, a critical edition, an exhibition, conferences and colloquia, and a project website."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,785,671</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GRAPH"><Rcn>191237</Rcn><Nid>11900</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>The Great War and Modern Philosophy</Name><PI>Nicolas James Laurent Fernando De Warren</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The First World War was an unprecedented event of destruction, transformation, and renewal that left no aspect of European culture unchanged. Philosophy proved no exception: the war motivated an historically singular mobilization of philosophers to write about the war during the years of conflict; significant works of philosophy were written during the war years and immediately thereafter; the postwar decades of the 1920s and 1930s witnessed a systematic reconfiguration of the landscape of philosophical thought that still largely defines contemporary philosophy. Surprisingly, while the impact of the war on literature, poetry, and the arts, political thought has been a subject of intense inquiry and interpretation, the significance of the war for modern philosophy remains relatively unexamined, often misunderstood or simply taken for granted.

This project aims at understanding the impact of the Great War on modern philosophy. It aims to chart an original course and establish a new standard for the philosophical study of the relation between the First World War and 20th-century philosophy through a comparative and critical approach to a diverse array of thinkers. Specifically, this project will investigate the hypothesis of whether diverse philosophical responses, direct and indirect, immediately or postponed, can be understood as formulations of different questions posed, or better: catalyzed by the war itself. This project will additionally argue that the very idea that war could reveal, challenge or legitimate cultural or philosophical meaning is itself a legacy of a distinctive kind of war-philosophy produced during the war.

This project will be divided into four sub-projects: (1) ""Philosophy of War and the Wars of Philosophy,""; (2)  ""The Philosophy of Language and the Languages of Philosophy""; (3) ""The Care of the Soul""; (4) ""Europe after Europe."""</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,652,102</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Historicaldatabase"><Rcn>185631</Rcn><Nid>11376</Nid><HI>Stockholms Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>The Swedish historical database project</Name><PI>Per Einar Pettersson Lidbom</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The Swedish historical data base project will put together and make publicly available highly disaggregated data on roughly a yearly basis for about 2500 Swedish administrative districts over the period 1749-1952. The finished data set will consist of comprehensive and detailed information on economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agriculture statistics and infrastructure investments (e.g., railway construction).  The comprehensiveness and complete coverage of historical data at the local administrative level is what makes this project unique from an international perspective. Since Sweden has the longest continuous and reliable data series on population and vital statistics in the world,starting as early as 1749, makes it possible to construct a comprehensive panel data set over all 2,500 Swedish local administrative units covering a 200 year period. Consequently, the total number of observations for each variable can be as large as 0.5 million (N=2500&#195;&#151;T=200). With this type of rich and disaggregated historical data it become possible to get a better understanding of economic growth, structural transformation and economic development. Also, within-country variation allows for more satisfying empirical identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities or difference-in-differences estimation. As a case in point, I have demonstrated the potential usefulness of the Swedish historical data by addressing the question of whether redistribution of resources towards the poor differs between types of democracy after democratization. The identification strategy is based on a regression-discontinuity design where the type of democracy partly is a function of population size.

Whereas exclusivity is conventionally considered as the core element and purpose of property right, sharing and collectively using resources, either tangible or intellectual, is an increasing practice and a new field of research in the legal, sociological, cultural and economic academy. From public domain in copyright, the open access or copyleft licensing to the multiple and complex authorship resulting from online wiki creation and new forms of cohousing based on common spaces and property, all rely on the lack or limitation of exclusive rights and the accommodation of symmetric entitlements of other individuals. All share a sense of &#226;&#128;&#152;inclusivity&#226;&#128;&#153; that can be defined by (1) the absence of a power to exclude others, which leads to inclusion of others in the use and (2) the collectiveness and interdependency of privileges to use a resource. Yet, no legal tool is available to comprehend such inclusivity, but the notion of &#226;&#128;&#152;commons&#226;&#128;&#153; devoid of any normative content. The INCLUSIVE project will study allocation of resources grounded on inclusivity and the issues raised by such legal vacuum or inadequate application of exclusivity-based rules. INCLUSIVE will elaborate a legal model of &#226;&#128;&#152;inclusive right&#226;&#128;&#153; allowing for organised collectiveness, enforceability and sustainability and assess its applicability in selected fields. Instead of forcing exclusive rights on situations organised around inclusivity, the project radically innovates by rethinking the categories of legal interests, with new conceptual and methodological frameworks and adapted normative criteria. This legal concept could have discrete applications and play a role in two major challenges of our times: the sustainability of natural or informational resources and the connected agency of individuals in the digital environment."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,361,382</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INDIRECT"><Rcn>185679</Rcn><Nid>12033</Nid><HI>Turun Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Intergenerational Cumulative Disadvantage and Resource Compensation</Name><PI>Jani Petteri Erola</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The previous literature has not been able to successfully explain why the loss of the certain family resources does not show as a weaker attainment. Neither the country differences in socioeconomic inheritance seem to reflect the institutional differences between them. We argue that these problems have followed from ignoring resource compensation. The lost capital (economic, human/cultural or social) may be replaced with the other types or with the resources of someone else (the new or extended family members or neighbors). European and other developed societies can be distinguished by their abilities to influence the compensation of the loss of the parental resources rather than by their direct impact on inheritance.

We study compensation in three analytic contexts:
1) Life-course changes followed by the loss of parental resources. The specific events to be considered are parental bereavement, separation, unemployment and geographical mobility.
2) Period changes in society reducing resources in many families approximately at the same time. The examples to be analyzed are economic recession, the inflation of educational credentials due to increasing overall level of education and changing family structures and family formation processes.
3) Structural disadvantage associated with lower level of parental resources. The forms of inequality to be analyzed include the number of siblings sharing the parental resources and childhood neighborhood and the compensation of low resources with the resources of the parents of the spouse.

We use high level Finnish register panel data to analyze the loss compensation after specific life course events. The results are compared to those acquired from German SOEP data and US-based PSID data. Multiple country comparisons are conducted using ESS. The project combines three novel analytic approaches: sibling correlation methods, conditional multinomial (event history) models and sequence analysis."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,880,328</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InfoAsymMarkets"><Rcn>185620</Rcn><Nid>10041</Nid><HI>Collegio Carlo Alberto - Centro Di Ricerca E Alta Formazione, Italy</HI><Name>Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries</Name><PI>Donato (Dino) Gerardi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The goal of this proposal is to advance the theory of decentralized trade with informational asymmetries and limited commitment.
In most trading situations, some of the parties possess superior information about critical aspects of the environment. For example, in financial markets, professional investors are better informed about the quality of the assets that they sell to individuals. Similarly, consumers typically have private information about their willingness to pay for goods and services. It is well understood that informational asymmetries are responsible for one of the most serious forms of market inefficiency. Because of its strong assumptions in term of commitment, the standard theory of mechanism design is unsuitable for the study of many actual trading institutions. On the other hand, the focus of most of the existing literature on trading with limited commitment is the case in which the parties can trade at most once. While satisfactory in situations like the sale of a house, this assumption leaves out many important economic environments where the parties trade repeatedly over time. However, repeated transactions are natural both when the objects of trade are non-durable (e.g., services such as phone or internet plans) and when they are durable but divisible (e.g., financial assets). A crucial difference between these cases and those analyzed in the literature is the fact that the information revealed in early transactions may affect the outcome of future negotiations.
We plan to provide a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries. Our investigation will shed light on the properties of various commonly used trading mechanisms and will inform us about possible remedies to make them more efficient. This will contribute substantially to the design of adequate institutions and to the regulation of markets.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>827,410</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="JAXPERTISE"><Rcn>191231</Rcn><Nid>10606</Nid><HI>Kozep-Europai Egyetem, Hungary</HI><Name>Joint action expertise: Behavioral, cognitive, and neural mechanisms for joint action learning</Name><PI>Natalie Sebanz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Human life is full of joint action and our achievements are, to a large extent, joint achievements that require the coordination of two or more individuals. Piano duets and tangos, but also complex technical and medical operations rely on and exist because of coordinated actions. In recent years, research has begun to identify the basic mechanisms of joint action. This work focused on simple tasks that can be performed together without practice. However, a striking aspect of human joint action is the expertise interaction partners acquire together. How people acquire joint expertise is still poorly understood. JAXPERTISE will break new ground by identifying the behavioural, cognitive, and neural mechanisms underlying the learning of joint action. Participating in joint activities is also a motor for individual development. Although this has long been recognized, the mechanisms underlying individual learning through engagement in joint activities remain to be spelled out from a cognitive science perspective. JAXPERTISE will make this crucial step by investigating how joint action affects source memory, semantic memory, and individual skill learning. Carefully designed experiments will optimize the balance between capturing relevant interpersonal phenomena and maximizing experimental control. The proposed studies employ behavioural measures, electroencephalography, and physiological measures. Studies tracing learning processes in novices will be complemented by studies analyzing expert performance in music and dance. New approaches, such as training participants to regulate each other&#226;&#128;&#153;s brain activity, will lead to methodological breakthroughs. JAXPERTISE will generate basic scientific knowledge that will be relevant to a large number of different disciplines in the social sciences, cognitive sciences, and humanities.

Recently, scholarship has turned to a new research agenda less focused on conflict: the examination of the Romanness of the Jews who lived in the Roman empire, and, in particular, that of the Palestinian Rabbis. While this new trend is both welcome and necessary in order to balance previous approaches, it still leaves an essential question unanswered, perhaps the great impens&#195;&#169; of the encounter between Jews and Romans. Beyond Roman concrete political decisions concerning Jews, and the Jews&#226;&#128;&#153; adoption of Roman cultural features such as baths, how did Roman imperialism affect the ways Judaism &#226;&#128;&#147; both rabbinic and non-rabbinic &#226;&#128;&#147; defined itself?
This project shall answer this question by analyzing an overlooked dimension of the problem. It will examine how Roman imperialism challenged Judaism both religiously and politically because of the rivalry &#226;&#128;&#147; from the Jewish perspective &#226;&#128;&#147; between Jewish and Roman universalisms and &#226;&#128;&#156;messianic&#226;&#128;&#157; ideals. This analysis shall make it possible to assess how the Jewish encounter with Rome contributed to shaping Judaism itself, in particular regarding sensitive issues such as the integration of non-Jews in Jewish society, the Jews&#226;&#128;&#153; conception of Jewish Law as a national and/or universal law, and Israel&#226;&#128;&#153;s role in the establishment of a just universal political order. Moreover, in order to better comprehend the specificity of the Jewish responses to Rome, this study shall compare them to those of the Greeks and other peoples dominated by Rome, as well as to those of the Christians until the beginning of the fourth century CE. Finally, it shall try to assess the impact of the Christianization of the empire on the changes within Judaism that began with its encounter with &#226;&#128;&#156;pagan&#226;&#128;&#157; Rome.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,433,123</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="KNOWING"><Rcn>192291</Rcn><Nid>13225</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Epistemic intersections in early modern England: the place of literature</Name><PI>Subha Mukherji</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project uncovers the interface between imaginative literature and epistemology in its wider sense in early modern England (1500-1700). This period of intense literary production also saw the cultural forces of humanism and the Reformation collide; crucial shifts in the law; scientific advancement; and dramatic expansion in trade and travel. At stake across the board was knowledge: its theories and technologies, its excitements and anxieties. We examine intersections between literary forms and apparently disparate areas of thinking about ways of knowing:
&#226;&#128;&#162; theology
&#226;&#128;&#162; natural philosophy
&#226;&#128;&#162; economic thinking
&#226;&#128;&#162; law
Subsequent disciplinary segregation has obscured the understood relations among these disciplines: epistemic transactions vital to the experiences of knowledge and belief which so deeply vexed and shaped the period&#226;&#128;&#153;s thought.

Our quarry is the specific intervention of literary texts in this conversation. What does literature know, or tell us, that other discourses cannot, or do not, because of their disciplinary investments? What aspirations to objectivity or assurance will it not share with science, religion or the law? How does it complicate economic ideas of insurance by translating them to affective notions of risk and surety? And how do these cognate practices engage with literary constitutions of knowledge? To recover the multiple frame against which this culture articulates its conceptions of knowledge, we read these fields as coeval but distinct. Across the five years, we use two thematic foci to explore and institutionalise the blind spots of knowledge, thereby rewriting the story of early modern epistemology:
i) knowing and knowingness;
ii) doubt and unknowing

To grasp the dialogic relations, we must harness specialist expertise in each discipline.

Predictive coding is a fundamental theory of sensory processing in the brain that has recently gained enormous attention in psychology and neuroscience. While models of language assume a bottom-up driven processing stream from sensory areas through different linguistic processing stages (e.g., phonetic, syntactic) towards semantic interpretation, predictive coding postulates that high-level brain systems actively construct models of the external world and pass resulting predictions about upcoming events to lower sensory systems. Only if predictions are violated, a prediction error is signalled in a bottom-up fashion to higher areas where internal models are adjusted to minimize prediction error. Here, I postulate that language-processing is the result of multiple overlapping predictions from different sources of linguistic information, if available. I propose a research program that (a) explores the presence of neurophysiological markers of predictive coding during language processing, (b) tests quantitative hypotheses from predictive coding concerning strength and precision of prediction error signals, for established language effects, and (c) explores the domain generality of identified mechanisms. To this end, established electrophysiological and brain activation markers of sentence processing will be combined with advanced model-based data analysis tools. Finally, a comprehensive functional architecture of language shall be established that incorporates dynamically reconfigurable feedforward and feedback information flow in the language system."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,552,740</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LATTAL"><Rcn>188645</Rcn><Nid>10644</Nid><HI>Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Spain</HI><Name>The Latin Talmud and its Influence on Christian-Jewish Polemic</Name><PI>Alexander Fidora</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"While polemics and dialogue between Judaism and Christianity are as old as the Christian religion itself, one can clearly distinguish different periods, trends and intensities in the relations between the faiths. A significant landmark in this long and complex history is the Latin translation of large sections of the Talmud, the most important Jewish post-biblical text and the basis for the development of Rabbinic Judaism.
When during the 13th century Christian theologians started to examine and translate the Talmud from Hebrew and Aramaic into Latin, they were faced with a huge body of texts which represented centuries of legalistic and homiletic materials. The discovery of this immense post-biblical Jewish literature became a source of fascination for Christians who believed that this text, which encompasses every aspect of Jewish life, was fundamental both for refuting the Jewish faith and for substantiating the truth of Christianity. This realization heralded a rethinking of the place of Jews in Christian society and redefined Christian-Jewish dialogue and polemic.
The purpose of our project is to edit and publish the largest extant collection of Talmudic passages translated from Hebrew into Latin, that is, the ""Extractiones de Talmud"", while studying this ground-breaking document in the context of the trial and burning of the Talmud in 1240-42 and its aftermath.
This project addresses vital questions of Jewish and Christian identity, still relevant to the 21st century, and can only be carried out by a transdisciplinary research team including specialists from Latin Philology, Hebrew Studies and History."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,292,700</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MEMOPHI"><Rcn>185571</Rcn><Nid>12341</Nid><HI>Albert-Ludwigs-Universitaet Freiburg, Germany</HI><Name>Medieval Philosophy in Modern History of Philosophy</Name><PI>Catherine K&#195;&#182;nig</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"MEMOPHI plans the first comprehensive study of how eighteenth- and nineteenth-century historians of philosophy reconstructed medieval thought. Associating intellectual and cultural approaches, it investigates to what ends and how the history of medieval philosophy has been written, used and institutionalised in European institutions of knowledge. In the 18th and 19th centuries, history and philosophy were at the center of the scientific endeavour. Philosophy gave itself a history in the scientific sense of the word, and the scientific practice of philosophy was secularized in the new academies and universities. Writing the history of philosophy was a process of introspection and discrimination, putting into play the self-conception of the discipline. In this context, the Middle Ages occupied a central place: the first university was founded around 1200 and institutionalized the future practices of Western science. The scholastic Middle Ages and the modern period constitute indeed the two inaugural moments in the history of university thought. Modern historians of philosophy reconstructed, evaluated and criticized the scientific practices of medieval authors whom they considered as medieval &#226;&#128;&#156;philosophers&#226;&#128;&#157; and thus as the first university philosophers. Furthermore, these modern reconstructions of medieval philosophy distinguished and described various medieval &#226;&#128;&#156;cultures&#226;&#128;&#157; &#226;&#128;&#147; Jewish, Arabic, Christian, etc. &#226;&#128;&#147; for the purposes of defining the cultural identity of modern Europe and of European nations. In a broader context MEMOPHI addresses the intersection between cultural politics (notably the creations of national cultural identities) and reconstructions of philosophy&#226;&#128;&#153;s past.

The second objective aims at extending the analyses of optimal monetary policy to abnormal times where deleveraging or liquidity shocks bring the nominal interest rate to the zero lower bound and more unconventional policies are needed.

MULTISENSE will explain how the human brain comes to develop this complex ability, and how certain genetically &#226;&#128;&#152;pre-marked&#226;&#128;&#153; brains can come to experience multisensory integration in remarkable ways. Implicit associations across the senses can have a profound and sometimes surprising effect on our experiences (eg, the  taste of food can be altered simply by changing its colour, its shape, or even its name). People with the neurological condition synaesthesia have cross-sensory interactions to an extreme degree (eg, they might experience tastes as colourful moving shapes in the visual field). Synaesthesia can give profound insights into normal perception because all people experience crossed sensations to an implicit degree, and often in ways that mimic synaesthetes (eg, rougher textures tend to be &#226;&#128;&#152;seen&#226;&#128;&#153; as darker colours by synaesthetes, and are also paired to darker colours by nonsynaesthetes in sensory matching tasks). In this ambitious proposal I will examine the life-span development of multisensory integration in both synaesthetes and nonsynaesthetes, considering changes that occur throughout childhood, non-elderly adulthood, and older age. My project will unfold over 48 months across 4 inter-related Work Programmes, in which I will develop a state-of-the-art assessment tool to identify child synaesthetes, and use cognitive tests and experimental techniques to evaluate multisensory functions in synaesthetes and nonsynaesthetes across the lifespan. My questions stand at the frontier of our scientific understanding, and will develop an embryonic field of childhood synaesthesia research, and forge a wholly novel field in synaesthesia and aging. My findings will be fed back to both researchers and educational policy makers, and will frame this field for current and future academics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,314,131</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MacroColl"><Rcn>185603</Rcn><Nid>10747</Nid><HI>Centre De Recerca En Economia Internacional (Crei), Spain</HI><Name>The Macroeconomics of Collateral</Name><PI>Alberto Miguel Martin</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Financial markets constitute the backbone of modern economies, intermediating resources from those who have them (i.e., lenders) to those who can put them to productive use (i.e., borrowers). The defining feature of these markets is that they entail the exchange of goods today for a borrower&#226;&#128;&#153;s promise to deliver goods in the future. These promises are sustained by guarantees, which are akin to the amount of future income that borrowers can credibly pledge to lenders. I refer to this pledgeable income as an economy&#226;&#128;&#153;s stock of collateral. This stock determines the amount and type of promises that can be traded in an economy and, in turn, this set of promises determines the transactions that can be carried out. Intuitively, when this set of promises is large, resources find their most productive uses and efficiency is high.
This raises a general question: what are the key determinants of the set of promises that an economy is able to sustain, and why does it vary?
In macroeconomic models, it is commonly assumed that all promises are backed by only one kind of collateral, i.e. usually that of private borrowers, and that this collateral is &#226;&#128;&#152;fundamental&#226;&#128;&#153;, i.e. it consists of output. Real-world financial markets, however, rely on many types of collateral to guarantee promises. In this proposal, I focus on three such types. First, collateral may be &#226;&#128;&#152;bubbly&#226;&#128;&#153;, i.e. promises can be backed by nothing else but the income that the sale of new promises is expected to bring in the future. Second, collateral need not be private, as government promises are sustained by pledging public income. Third, collateral need not be homogenous, as it may differ in quality or type across entrepreneurs, and this quality may not be perfectly observed by all. I address the following broad questions. How do economies produce these different types of collateral? How do they interact with one another? Is there a role for policy in maintaining the efficient level and composition of collateral?</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>979,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NAMO"><Rcn>191992</Rcn><Nid>13163</Nid><HI>Uniwersytet Im.

While source criticism and historicism have today become key parts of historical consciousness in Asia, Asian historical representations are nonetheless firmly embedded in pre-modern Asian literary traditions via specific uses in historical writing of traditional rhetorical structures of narrative, emplotment, tropes, and literary imagery.
Taking such linkage between present and past Asian traditions of historiography as its premise, project NAMO &#226;&#128;&#147; with four team members consisting of the PI and three Postdocs &#226;&#128;&#147; will examine the literary features of Asian historiography in India, China, and Tibet across the longue dur&#195;&#169;e of the classical, medieval, and modern periods. First, a new method for the study of the literary forms that characterize historiography in Asia will be established by adapting basic analytical principles from Asian literary theories drawn from twelve classical Indian and Chinese works on poetics. Next, the team will determine the specific literary characteristics of narrative, plot, tropes, and historical explanation found in seventeen classical and medieval histories composed in China, India, and Tibet. Finally, it will be examined to which extent those traditional literary features still function as constitutive rhetorical elements in modern Asian history writing. This will be done by analyzing the literary forms used in a selection of twenty representative histories written in the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India during the period 1980-2010.
The outcome will be a novel approach for the empirical study of Asian history that will open up a new level of comparative work in the theory of history across non-Western and Western traditions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,162</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NOMADICEMPIRES"><Rcn>185570</Rcn><Nid>11973</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Nomadic Empires: A World-Historical Perspective</Name><PI>Pekka Johannes H&#195;&#164;m&#195;&#164;l&#195;&#164;inen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project provides a wide-ranging and inclusive reinterpretation of the history of equestrian nomadic empires from the fourth century BCE to the late nineteenth century CE. The project has four major objectives that are interrelated. First, it expands the scope of the research significantly by extending it beyond the better known Eurasian nomadic empires into the Americas, where new research has revealed&#226;&#128;&#148;and may yet reveal&#226;&#128;&#148;previously unidentified nomadic empires. The project also re-examines the 7th-century expansion of the Arab Bedouins as an expression of nomadic imperial formation. Second, the project seeks to untangle the study of nomadic empires from normative and mechanistic models by developing new conceptual avenues that allow us to examine nomadic empires on their own cultural terms. It re-examines the intersections among mobility, expansion, exploitation, incorporation and dominance by reorienting research toward a new set of heuristic avenues: the nodal spatial composition of nomadic regimes, the centrality of borderlands in imperial formation, and a notion of nomadic empires as kinetic empires that turned mobility into an imperial strategy. Third, the project breaks new methodological ground by showing how innovative and underused approaches&#226;&#128;&#148;integration of environmental and imperial histories; blending of multiple analytical scales to reveal the socio-political complexity of nomadic societies; and a specific spatial reorientation in which developments are viewed holistically from nomadic domains outward&#226;&#128;&#148;produce a broader and more nuanced understanding of the emergence, behaviour and historical influences of nomadic empires. Such approaches will uncover a range of different nomadic empires across the world over a vast time span. The fourth objective of the project is to represent and explain those empires as a multifaceted world-shaping phenomenon through process-oriented comparisons that focus on imperial dynamics rather than imperial types.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,584</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NORMCOMMIT"><Rcn>192055</Rcn><Nid>10024</Nid><HI>Fondation Jean-Jacques Laffont,toulouse Sciences Economiques, France</HI><Name>Origins and Effects of Normative Commitments</Name><PI>Daniel Li Chen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>A debate in the development of legal institutions is whether individuals obey the law because the law incentivizes or because the law has legitimacy.  Much of the PI&#226;&#128;&#153;s research in law and in development seeks to understand how people form normative commitments, i.e., what people view as the moral and right thing to do, and how they respond to these normative commitments.  His work traces the incentives that lead to human rights violations.  The PI has examined how interpretations of religious and legal texts, particularly those associated with fundamentalism, interact with market forces.  In two multi-part studies, the PI investigated the economic forces underlying the religious provision of social insurance, social sanctions, social conservatism, and the economic incentives that give rise to gender violence, sexual harassment, and regulation of the private domain.  Through these investigations, the PI formulated a theory for why church-state separation arose in some countries but not in others, developed a methodology for empirically evaluating the effects of normative commitments, and used a particular instance of interpretive injustice where capital cases in the British Army during World War I were randomly executed or commuted, in order to estimate the deterrent and delegitimizing effects of the death penalty. The proposed project builds on this previous work. The proposal rests on 2 pillars: Normative Commitments in Health Care and Normative Commitments in Courts.  Within these 2 pillars, the PI studies the effects of market forces on normative commitments and examines how normative commitments come into existence in the first place.  (1) Normative Commitments in Health Care: The PI will measure the influence of pharmaceutical company payments to physicians on their normative commitments. This pillar will evaluate the effects of payments on physician prescriptions and patient outcomes. The pillar will examine whether disclosure laws affect the relationship between payments, prescriptions, and patient outcomes. The pillar will employ a unique U.S. dataset on over 2 billion prescription claims per year on up to 177 million individuals and a Danish database of all prescription drugs sold linked to prescribers with pharmaceutical associations. (2) Normative Commitments in Courts: This pillar will use the random assignment of judges in common law courts to measure the impact of exogenous changes in legal precedent. The pillar will apply a method co-developed by the PI for two-stage least squares estimation (Econometrica (80(6), 2369-2429, 2012) that exploits judicial characteristics as instrumental variables. The pillar will study the effects of 24 legal areas, including capital punishment, free speech, gay rights, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and rights of the disabled.  The pillar will use this data to study the origin of rights.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,591,939</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Networks"><Rcn>185629</Rcn><Nid>12013</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; D'aix-Marseille, France</HI><Name>Markets and Networks</Name><PI>Yann Bramoull&#195;&#169;</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Economists are becoming increasingly aware of the importance and ubiquity of social networks. The economics of social networks constitutes one of the most active areas of research in economics. Despite much progress, however, our understanding of the relationships between markets and networks is still poor and fragmentary. This project will advance the state of the art by analyzing the relations between markets and networks in two domains.

I will first study theoretically the interaction between formal insurance and networks of informal insurance. I will analyze how the position in a risk-sharing network affects the incentives to adopt formal insurance, how network structure affects overall adoption, how formal insurance could benefit from network monitoring on efforts and whether the adoption of formal insurance strengthen or weaken the risk-sharing network. Second, I will study theoretically the impact of networks on markets with search frictions. I will derive the full-fledged equilibrium implications of network-based search in matching models of the labor market. I will also introduce recall in a finite-horizon matching model and study the impact of the emerging network of trading partners.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>481,087</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="P-CYCLES"><Rcn>185543</Rcn><Nid>11971</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Perceptual Cycles: Exploring and controlling the perceptual consequences of brain rhythms</Name><PI>Rufin Bernard Edmond Vanrullen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Many current theories implicate brain oscillations in perception, attention, consciousness or memory. This, however, has one critical implication that is often overlooked in cognitive sciences: if a perceptual function relies on an oscillatory basis, then it should operate periodically, as a sequence of successive episodes or 'snapshots', with more or less favourable moments recurring at a well-defined periodicity. The present project aims to explore the validity and the consequences of this groundbreaking notion of ""rhythmic perception"". Whereas current research links perceptual functions to relatively slow changes of oscillatory amplitude, we propose to investigate the perceptual consequences of brain rhythms at the rapid time scale of the oscillatory cycle &#226;&#128;&#147;the notion of ""perceptual cycles"". In work-package (WP) 1, we will explore the range of perceptual and cognitive operations that depend on oscillatory neural implementations, and reveal their cyclic behaviour. In WP2, we will relate these perceptual and cognitive cycles to the underlying neural activities by means of brain imaging techniques (EEG, fMRI, TMS); a key innovation is a proposed novel fMRI method to visualize the spatio-temporal propagation of perceptual cycles. In WP3, we will utilize this knowledge to control the power, frequency and phase of perceptual rhythms and thus dynamically manipulate, improve or prevent perception. In WP4, we will bridge the gap between lower- and higher-frequency perceptual cycles (from ~2 to ~100Hz) by experimental studies of cross-frequency coupling and computational models of visual information multiplexing. The project as a whole will characterize the rhythmic dynamics of perception, their neural basis and their functional implications, bringing us closer to understanding perception itself. The idea that sensory perception and cognition might follow a succession of snapshots rather than a continuous stream could spark a major transformation in cognitive sciences."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,860,672</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PALEOPLANT"><Rcn>185568</Rcn><Nid>12342</Nid><HI>Universidad Del Pais Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Spain</HI><Name>Palaeolithic Plant Use in the Western Mediterranean</Name><PI>Lydia Zapata</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project deals with one of the big gaps of knowledge in prehistory, how plant foods and resources were used by preagrarian societies. Plants have been fundamental for human societies across the planet. However, it is a blank when it comes to archaeological evidence of humans eating and exploiting them during most part of Prehistory. This work aims at changing the meat/hunting centred paradigm of Palaeolithic subsistence by readdressing human plant exploitation through a novel interdisciplinary approach. The main objectives are: 1) To assess wild plant exploitation among Palaeolithic-Epipalaeolithic societies, 2) To appraise resilience and change in Palaeolithic-Epipalaeolithic plant use, and 3) To improve archaeological methodology and fieldwork. The chronology of analysis &#226;&#128;&#147;from the Late Middle Palaeolithic to the Epipalaeolithic- includes two extremely interesting periods: a) the transition from the middle to the upper Palaeolithic with neanderthal extinction and early presence of modern humans which gives us the opportunity to explore and compare whether these groups exploit plant resources in a different way, and b) the climatic change from the Late Pleistocene to the early Holocene which allows to evaluate how last hunter-gatherers from the region adapt to climatic change and new ecological conditions. The challenge of the work is to obtain archaeological visibility of plant use through and interdisciplinary approach that combines: pollen analysis, the study of plant macroremains including underground storage organs (USOs), micromorphology, analysis of microremains such as phytoliths and starch, ethnobotany and use-wear analyses on tools. The different types of evidence to be analysed come from relevant archaeological sites from Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

Performance art shall not only be presented as an object of study, but also as a central art genre implicitly and explicitly involved both in the investigation of cultural practices and in the creation of alternative ways of action. The project focuses, for one, on the artistic exploration of totalitarian or real-socialist practices, rituals, and gestures, but also on artistic ways of action developed in the course of underground activity. Eastern European performance art came to life under conditions in which it was from the very start considered as dubious both aesthetically and contentwise. However, tolerance, hindrance, and sometimes even prohibition led to a heightened degree of self-reflection, minimalism, abstraction, and analysis; in other words, to characteristics representative of the specificity of East European performance art between 1950 and 1990.
At the same time, the proposed project is to be understood as an archaeological one, for it sets out to reconstruct correlations and interactions between unofficial artistic production and official cultural practice. Moreover, it aims to make available to a broader public artistic endeavours that until now could not be centred on in research fields like art history, theatre-, and cultural studies in an Eastern European context.

The project will concentrate on the following four research areas:
1. Territorial interrelationships (between the Eastern European countries, between East and West)
2. Specificity of practice in Eastern European performance art (subversive affirmation, minimalism, abstraction)
3. Interrelationships between artistic action and political activism in the underground

Developing means for preserving and restoring cognitive functioning in old age is therefore of great importance. Age-related cognitive impairments have a complex and multifactorial etiology. Pharmaceutical approaches to prevention and treatment have therefore been unsuccessful, and searching for non-pharmaceutical approaches is important. Results of cognitive training studies have so far been disappointing. I hypothesize that the reason for this is that plasticity is functionally inhibited after normal childhood development. Plasticity is then further reduced in aging due to negative brain changes. In this sense, past studies on the effects of cognitive training in adulthood and old age have, so to speak, attempted to push a car that has the brakes on. In a series of experimental studies on humans, my research team will discover feasible ways to release inhibitory brakes on adult plasticity, develop routes to attenuate age-related negative effects on plasticity, and uncover the neural mediators of training-related change in performance, so that the effects of cognitive training can be increased and better understood. Outcome variables include measures of brain function, volume, and integrity acquired using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, and up-to-date measures of cognitive performance. Experimental effects on these measures will be evaluated using structural equation models suitable for analyzing repeated measures. This amalgamation of state-of-the-art methodology in the neurosciences and the behavioral sciences bolsters the uniqueness of this research program, which will enlighten the mechanisms of plasticity at neuronal and behavioral levels of analysis. The resulting insights will pave the way for effective rehabilitation of several neurological conditions and for reducing age-associated cognitive impairments."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,918,070</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RECIRC"><Rcn>185595</Rcn><Nid>12333</Nid><HI>National University Of Ireland, Galway, Ireland</HI><Name>"The Reception and Circulation of Early Modern&#226;&#128;&#153;s Women&#226;&#128;&#153;s Writing, 1550-1700"</Name><PI>Marie-Louise Coolahan</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project will produce a large-scale, quantitative analysis of the ways in which women&#226;&#128;&#153;s writing was received and circulated in the early modern period. By exploring the phenomenon of early modern literary reception in a rigorous and comprehensive way, the project will allow us to see more clearly the importance and function of reception; specifically how the field of reception articulates and develops critical and aesthetic engagements, how it reveals the extent to which gender shapes ideas about authorship, and how it historicizes our current debates about intellectual impact and gender. Existing reception scholarship has focused on qualitative case studies and tended to prioritize print culture; the field requires a quantitative approach that takes full account of the realities of textual transmission in a period when manuscript circulation retained its broad appeal. RECIRC overcomes the logistical challenges by focusing on the category of the manuscript miscellany and on networks as centres of textual circulation, producing new knowledge about transmission and book ownership. The project will test the hypothesis that the attribution of texts to anonymous, pseudonymous and gender-designated authors is revelatory regarding how gender determined reception.
RECIRC&#226;&#128;&#153;s specific objectives are: to challenge assumptions that women&#226;&#128;&#153;s penetration of the literary field in this period was limited by focusing on textual reception rather than production; to transform current thinking on the nature of impact and the quality of reception by classifying and analysing the modes of textual engagement in new ways; to provoke a new understanding of the invention of the author in this period by approaching the question via reception, grounding it in a gendered understanding of the complex constructions of authorship that includes the exploitation of anonymity and pseudonymity; and to advance current discourses about scholarly impact by opening up and critiquing their historical contexts."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,823,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RaceFaceID"><Rcn>192057</Rcn><Nid>10016</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Race Matter: On the Absent Presence of Race in Forensic Identification</Name><PI>Aouatef Amade M'charek</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This ethnographic project on race in forensic practice aims to study how technologies of identification shape race. The focus is on &#226;&#128;&#152;face-making&#226;&#128;&#153; in forensic identification; i.e. the reconstruction of faces of unknown persons, a practice entwined with &#226;&#128;&#152;race-making&#226;&#128;&#153;.

In five subprojects the study investigates: How technologies of facial identification in and outside laboratories enact race (subprojects 1-3); How versions of race change as knowledge moves across sites (subproject 4); The mechanism through which race becomes an absent present object, i.e. an object that appears to the surface, e.g. in discourse, to then go underground to hide in the routines and technologies of science, e.g. in genetic markers (subproject 5).

The overall objective of this interdisciplinary project is to develop theoretical concepts and methods to grasp the absent present object race. The project goes beyond the social constructivist paradigm, by taking the biological into account. It attends to the materiality of race, i.e. the ways race is shaped as a set of relations between the biological, the social and the technical.

This project is innovative in several ways. It is the first to comprehensively study race and forensics, a highly relevant field where knowledge circulates constantly between science and society. The ethnographic subprojects are innovative in the way they compare frontier science of genetics to every day practices, such as facial composite drawings and skull-based reconstructions. Because of its focus on race-in-practice, this project will make a major contribution to the social sciences by providing tools to theorize the materiality of race. Finally, this innovative project comprises a multi-sited ethnography that follows routes of knowledge into and out of the laboratory to various sites in society.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,935</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Roads"><Rcn>192571</Rcn><Nid>13418</Nid><HI>School Of Oriental And African Studies, University Of London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Roads and the politics of thought: Ethnographic approaches to infrastructure development in South Asia</Name><PI>Edward Simpson</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>New roads are being constructed at unprecedented rates in certain parts of the world.

As cheap oil dwindles and questions of climate change remain, why are so many international institutions cultivating new roads?

The project will provide the first ethnographic account of the culture of road builders, their knowledge practices, inter-relations and motivations. The research will be rooted in case studies of particular road projects in Pakistan, India, Maldives and Sri Lanka. These sites have been selected to bring to the fore how nation-building, neo-liberalism, ambition, environmental vulnerability and modernity feature in contemporary road-building. We will look at the organisation of road building on the ground, in offices, and within a broader array of institutions and state bodies in national and international contexts in order to understand the global cultures of road-building practice.

The project is academic in design and will contribute to various pressing and critical debates relating to power, global justice and environmental futures. The subject also merits wider discussion and at the core of the research design is an innovative collaboration between anthropologists and leading contemporary artists.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,159</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SECURE"><Rcn>188665</Rcn><Nid>12216</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>"Securing Europe, Fighting its Enemies: The making of a security culture in Europe and beyond, 1815-1914"</Name><PI>Beatrice Albertha De Graaf</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project examines the development of a European security culture as the sum of mutually shared perceptions on &#226;&#128;&#156;enemies of the states,&#226;&#128;&#157; &#226;&#128;&#156;vital interests,&#226;&#128;&#157; and corresponding practices, between 1815 and 1914. By studying seven distinct instances of supranational security cooperation and their professional agents we will analyze how this European security culture emerged as early as 1815 as an open process of convergence and divergence, and of inclusion and exclusion. The team consists of the PI, 3 PhDs, 1 Post-Doc, and a research assistant.

The postulated existence of a shared European security culture in the 19th century may seem counterintuitive. Historians and scholars of international relations generally view the first half of this age through the lenses of &#226;&#128;&#156;balance of power&#226;&#128;&#157; and hegemony, and the second half as shaped by bellicose nationalism rather than collective security. European security cooperation and culture is generally situated after 1918, or 1945, as a reaction to the horrors of war and motivated by economic considerations. Nevertheless, after 1815 several concrete transnational security regimes were forged, (partly) designed to deal with &#226;&#128;&#156;enemies of the states,&#226;&#128;&#157; such as the Commissions on the Rhine and the Danube (to fight smugglers), the European Commissions on Syria and China (to fight colonial rebels), the Anti-Piracy and Anti-Anarchism Campaigns, and others. These security regimes, dictated by the threats and interests, were highly dynamic, encompassing a growing corpus of professional agents from different branches (police, judicial, military), and evolving from military interventions into police and judicial regimes. They were midwife to a veritable European security culture. This important development has not received the attention it deserves within the framework of the history of international relations and international studies.

Our hypothesis is that the development of this culture (threat/interest perceptions and practices) was dependent on four determinants: 1) the quality of the epistemic community (agents), 2) their threat/interest demarcations (subject/object), 3) the level of juridification and the use of military/police force (norms), and 4) innovations in the information, communication, and transportation technologies (technology). These determinants explain variance and change, ranging from inclusion to exclusion of groups and interests, and from juridical convergence between the European states/societies regarding the security practices in some cases to a total dissolution in other cases.

This project pioneers a new multidisciplinary approach to the combined history of international relations and internal policy, aiming to &#226;&#128;&#156;historicize security.&#226;&#128;&#157; Using new material, we are comparing seven different security regimes where Europe engaged globally, that stretched across the political and commercial domain, affected urban and maritime environments, and reached around the world to the Ottoman Empire and China."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,973,419</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SESyP"><Rcn>185544</Rcn><Nid>11379</Nid><HI>Leuphana Universitat Luneburg, Germany</HI><Name>Identifying Social-Ecological System Properties Benefiting Biodiversity and Food Security</Name><PI>J&#195;&#182;rn Fischer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Ensuring food security and halting biodiversity decline are urgent, interconnected challenges. Drawing on the natural and social sciences, I propose an interdisciplinary research agenda to address these challenges. My goal is to develop a global theory that explains which properties of social-ecological systems benefit both biodiversity conservation and food security (and which benefit one but not the other). This holistic, systems-oriented approach radically differs from existing work: The most high-profile framing at present focuses on the question how to increase agricultural yields without compromising biodiversity. By contrast, a systems-oriented approach recognizes yield as just one variable alongside others that also influence biodiversity and food security. I will use a multi-scale approach that balances the likely trade-offs between depth and generality. Using a specifically developed typology of social-ecological system properties, I will investigate rural landscapes as social-ecological systems at three levels of detail. First, drawing on expert knowledge, I will develop a global database of at least 50 relevant systems, relating general system properties to indicators of food security and biodiversity. Second, I will conduct in-depth workshops on 15-20 social-ecological systems worldwide to reveal in more detail the causal linkages between system properties, food security and biodiversity. Third, I will conduct an in-depth empirical case study on food security and biodiversity in Ethiopia. This will complement the other components by highlighting the nature of potentially important regional subtleties. My multi-scale approach effectively combines high ambition and high feasibility. SESyP will produce new tools and a holistic theory of relevance to researchers, policy makers, supra-national bodies and non-governmental organizations worldwide.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,788,724</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SHARP"><Rcn>185542</Rcn><Nid>11966</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences</Name><PI>Laurens Julien Henri Cherchye</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Household consumption (including labor supply) is usually the outcome of a complex interaction between multiple household members. Understanding this consumption behavior requires non-unitary modeling of households, which recognizes that households are not single decision units but consist of interacting individuals. This project builds a powerful toolkit for empirical analysis of household consumption through structural models of individual preferences and within-household interactions. It opens the &#226;&#128;&#156;intrahousehold black box&#226;&#128;&#157; while only using the (limited) consumption information observed at the aggregate household level.

In particular, I develop a revealed preference methodology that is intrinsically nonparametric. This method (only) uses preference information that is directly revealed by the observed consumption choices. It avoids confounding the analysis by imposing (nonverifiable) parametric/functional structure on within-household decision processes. My main contribution is twofold:
1. At the theoretical level, I integrate marriage market dynamics into the structural modeling of household consumption. The marriage market defines the &#226;&#128;&#156;outside options&#226;&#128;&#157; of (adult) household members, which indirectly impacts the intrahousehold consumption allocation (e.g. through individual bargaining positions). Modeling these marriage market effects implies a better description of the intrahousehold decision process, which in turn yields a more powerful analysis of household consumption.
2. At the empirical level, I integrate revealed preference restrictions on non-unitary household consumption with nonparametric estimation of demand systems (subject to non-unitary shape restrictions on household demand). This will enhance the applicability of revealed preference methods to widely available (pooled) cross-section data sets. It also allows for addressing empirical issues such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and limited power of revealed preference restrictions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>851,581</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SNIHCY"><Rcn>191356</Rcn><Nid>10600</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Social Network Implementation of Health Campaigns Among Youth</Name><PI>Moniek Adrienne Buijzen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Western societies devote substantial resources to media health campaigns, especially targeting young people. Unfortunately, health campaigns often have disappointing impact. There is a compelling need for insight into campaign implementation in social life. Especially among youth, the social environment plays a crucial role in message processing. Therefore, health campaigns can only be improved with a multidisciplinary approach that can predict youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s behaviour within their social environment.

The proposed programme aims to develop a method for effective campaign implementation via youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s social networks. This method will (1) identify and target the most powerful influence agents in youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s social networks, (2) tailor campaign messages to the most effective influence mechanisms, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of social network implemented campaigns. The method will be based on the multidisciplinary Media X Social Influence (MXSI) model, integrating theories from communication, marketing, psychology, and sociology.

Five research projects focus on youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s weight-related behaviours. Drawing on a large-scale cross-sequential cohort study (N = 3,000, 9-15 y/o), the research (Phase I) tests and refines the MXSI model, identifying social influence agents and mechanisms, and (Phase II) tests the effectiveness of a social network-implemented health campaign in a group-randomised control trial, targeting the most powerful influence agents and mechanisms. The research projects use the Wearable Lab, a highly innovative smartphone-based research methodology.

The project is theoretically and methodologically pioneering and will produce a unique and useful method for improving health campaigns. Feasibility and success are guaranteed by the applicant&#226;&#128;&#153;s extensive experience and network. The applicant is one of the leading experts in the world on the role of marketing communication in youth socialisation and in translating these insights for health and prosocial purposes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,594</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SNP"><Rcn>185610</Rcn><Nid>10744</Nid><HI>London School Of Economics And Political Science, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Inference for Semi-Nonparametric Econometric Models</Name><PI>Taisuke Otsu</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This research project aims to contribute to advances in the research on semiparametric and nonparametric econometric methods by developing novel estimation and inference approaches in a variety of contexts and applying them to important empirical problems in economics.
The project is divided into four parts. The first part develops a Bayes procedure for the moment condition model. A likelihood function is constructed by employing an information theoretic projection from space of nonparametric prior distributions on data to space of distributions satisfying the moment conditions. Posterior sampling methods and asymptotic theory for the posterior are developed.
The second part focuses on the moment condition model but from a different perspective, robustness of decision methods. By focusing on local perturbations within shrinking topological neighborhoods, this part develops a framework to evaluate robustness of inference methods for the moment condition model. It is found that there is a computationally convenient method that achieves optimal minimax robust properties under local perturbations without losing asymptotic equivalence to GMM under correct specification.
The third part develops nonparametric regression techniques for extremal or tail behaviors. This part develops asymptotic theory for nonparametric quantile regression when the quantile drifts to 0 or 1 as the sample size increases. Based on the theory, a new inference method for extremal behaviors is developed.
The fourth part extends the empirical likelihood approach to a variety of empirical problems in economics. This part develops empirical likelihood inference methods for regression discontinuity designs, continuity or discontinuity of probability density functions, volatility measurement in high frequency financial data, and testing for partially identified moment inequality models. Also new concepts of nonparametric likelihood are developed by extending the likelihood theory on parametric models."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>866,454</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SOCIOGENOME"><Rcn>188670</Rcn><Nid>10636</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Unravelling the genetic influences of reproductive behaviour and gene-environment interaction</Name><PI>Melinda Mills</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project will be the first to engage in a comprehensive study of the role of genes and gene-environment (GxE) interaction on reproductive behaviour. Until now, social science research has focussed on socio-environmental explanations, largely neglecting the role of genes. Due to unprecedented advances in molecular genetics over the last two decades, for the first time in history we are able to examine whether there is a genetic component to reproductive outcomes, including age at first birth, number of children and infertility. Building on my substantive empirical research, I first develop a multifactor theoretical and measurement model isolating socio-environmental and lifestyle factors. Second, I apply the most cutting-edge techniques in genetics to examine the genetic architecture of reproductive behaviour, including: the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of reproductive choice; polygenic risk scores; and, genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). Third, I focus on gene-environment interactions (GxE) to test different mechanisms of how the environment moderates genetic influences. Fourth, I propose to use genetic markers as instrumental variables (IVs) in a bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine causality and address the endogeneity of lifestyle and education in reproductive outcomes. This transdisciplinary project will produce fundamentally different results, overturn established links and deliver major breakthroughs in fertility research and beyond. This project is not only ground breaking by setting a new research agenda, but due to the inclusion of  new genetic variables and  techniques to study the causal effects of genes and their interaction with environment, will yield major innovations useful  within demography and beyond.

When young, these risks include wage risk, unemployment risk, entrepreneurial risk, and divorce risk. When old, one risks living to a very old age and running out of assets, being hit by expensive medical needs, and losing one&#226;&#128;&#153;s spouse. An important factor affecting people&#226;&#128;&#153;s risk exposure, and hence saving behaviour, is the public insurance provided by governments. Risks and insurance influence key economic choices and affect people&#226;&#128;&#153;s welfare, macroeconomic aggregates, and inequality.
The proposed research will develop and test models of individual and household saving to a) provide novel evidence on the determinants of saving at different ages; b) better quantify the interaction of saving with the insurance provided by the government and by one&#226;&#128;&#153;s family; c) study how individual-level decisions affect macroeconomic conditions and the distribution of wealth; d) evaluate the effects of policy proposals and different institutions using quantitative model economies, calibrated to both the U.S. and European countries.
The proposed applications include studying (i) the effects of means-tested public health insurance and its reforms on single retirees. (ii) A structural model of couples&#226;&#128;&#153; savings and risks in old age. (iii) Couples&#226;&#128;&#153; savings and labour supply during their whole life cycle, including the working stage. (iv) The effects of credit shocks on the saving and hiring of small-business owners and the resulting aggregates. (v) Differences in wealth accumulation between the healthy and the unhealthy.
By better modeling and quantifying saving motives, risks, and publicly provided insurance, we can propose more efficient reforms. By applying our analysis to both the US and to European economies we can reach a better understanding of the effects of different institutions across countries.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,216,477</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SystemicRisk"><Rcn>185670</Rcn><Nid>10726</Nid><HI>London School Of Economics And Political Science, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systemic Risk and Feedback to the Real Economy</Name><PI>Zhichao Kathy Yuan</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In this proposal I present two research themes that apply endogenous risk analysis to identify channels for the creation of systemic risk via various feedback loops. These projects identify new ways to consider and measure systemic financial risks and, more importantly, the linkages between the financial risks and the real economy, and the welfare consequences.

In the first research theme, the focus will be on the effect of network externality on systemic risk formation. I plan to model and estimate network externality using uniquely available datasets on interbank payment flows in the UK; on 176 UK banks&#226;&#128;&#153; counterparty exposure with detailed breakdown of market instruments, and on the BIS bilateral bank capital flows respectively. These analyses are important to understand the role of network in dampening or amplifying shocks and provide quantitative measurement of network-originated systemic (liquidity/default) risks. The impact of these projects is not limited to academia but also has important policy implications.

The second research theme will focus on the feedback effects and coordination that lead to excessive systemic risks. In reality, channels for systemic risks arise from unintended consequences embedded in constraints, regulations and frictions that lead to feedback loops and undesirable coordination. For example, my earlier work on feedback between the financial markets and the real economy (Ozdenoren and Yuan 2008, Goldstein, Ozdenoren and Yuan 2011, 2013) has shown that feedback through information friction channels could create excessive financial and real volatilities. In the proposal, I outline a series of projects that examine feedback channels that are related to compensation contracts of CEOs, liquidity, firesales, and regulatory features such as bailouts on excessive correlated risk-taking in the economy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>698,938</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TEMPLATE 2.0"><Rcn>185590</Rcn><Nid>11984</Nid><HI>Stichting Vu, Netherlands</HI><Name>Template 2.0: Depicting the picture in your head</Name><PI>Christian Nicolas Leon Olivers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the most important features of human vision is that it is selective. It flexibly samples the environment on the basis of what is relevant to our current tasks &#226;&#128;&#147; tasks such as driving, finding a product in the supermarket, or collecting a child from school. This means that the brain maintains some representation of what we are currently looking for, be it a traffic sign, a coffee brand, or a kid&#226;&#128;&#153;s face. This &#226;&#128;&#156;picture in your head&#226;&#128;&#157;, or &#226;&#128;&#156;template&#226;&#128;&#157; as it is often referred to, remains a huge mystery. Current models of visual exploration assume it to be there, but without making explicit what its properties and mechanisms are. The proposed program will change this. Based on a three-state model of human memory, I have identified several lines of research that collectively lead to a thorough understanding of one of the most fundamental concepts of perceptual theory. These lines systematically investigate what distinguishes the template from other types of memory, how many templates can be active at a time, how we set up, change, and abandon the template with changing task demands, and  how training changes the nature, dynamics and capacity of the template. Each of these lines builds on my extensive track record in investigating memory and attention, and combines modern psychological, brain imaging, and modeling methods with innovative experimental paradigms. The result will be a comprehensive understanding of visual selection, of what makes human perception so adaptive. As such it will carry important implications for the fields of psychology and neuroscience, as well as clinical fields. In addition, the results are of direct relevance for how humans interact with ever more intelligent information systems, thus promoting safety and efficiency of everyday life.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,780</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSRIGHTS"><Rcn>188668</Rcn><Nid>12220</Nid><HI>Instituto De Ciencias Sociais Da Universidade De Lisboa, Portugal</HI><Name>Gender citizenship and sexual rights in Europe: transgender lives from a transnational perspective</Name><PI>Sofia Isabel Da Costa D'aboim Inglez</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The TRANSRIGHTS project investigates transgender lives and the institutional apparatus that frames them. Rather than focusing exclusively on self displayed identities, four lines of inquiry will be developed. Firstly, gender politics and sexual rights are analyzed as the opposition between politics of equality and of difference is unable to provide answers for the inclusion of trans-people. Secondly, by comparing the lives of trans-people in five European countries &#226;&#128;&#147; Portugal, France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden &#226;&#128;&#147; we wish to attain an overview of how institutional frameworks impact on these lives. Thirdly, our approach will take into account the immigration of trans-individuals to Europe, whether in search for recognition or as a way of survival often leading to sex work. Fourthly, by comparing different countries, different groups of transgender people, different forms of attaining inclusion or dealing with exclusion, different conceptions of gender citizenship and sexual rights, we wish not only to gain a deeper understanding of societal change and its impact on the lives of transgender individuals, but also to identify the gaps between policies and rights and the categories actually mobilized for self-identification. Such a task implies examining the voices of trans-people, the effect of policies on the materiality of lives as well as conceptualizations of selfhood that do not necessarily confine to the European context. Project outputs will contribute to the fields of gender, sexuality and citizenship by providing a grounded theoretical debate, discussing the gender categories of citizenship. Trans-people are a heterogeneous group that represents one of the most challenging boundaries for framing this debate within and beyond Europe. The voices of trans-people are essential to avoid an excessive reduction of lives to institutional categories, whether from the institutional apparatus, the LGBT movements or the social sciences."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,262,943</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Transfer-Learning"><Rcn>191311</Rcn><Nid>10771</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Trento, Italy</HI><Name>Transfer Learning within and between brains</Name><PI>Giorgio Coricelli</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The neural bases of adaptive behavior in social environments are far from being understood.

We plan to develop a model of adaptive learning based on three basic principles: (1) the observation of the outcome of un-chosen options improves the decisions taken in the learning process, (2) learning can be transferred from one domain to another, and (3) learning can be transferred from one agent to another (i.e. social learning). In all three cases, humans appear able to construct and transfer knowledge from sources other than their own direct experience, an underappreciated though we believe critical aspect of learning. Our approach will combine neural and behavioral data with computational models of learning. The hypotheses will be formalized into machine learning algorithms and neural networks of &#226;&#128;&#156;regret&#226;&#128;&#157; learning, to quantify the evolution of the learning computations on a trial-by-trial basis from the sequence of stimuli, choices and outcomes. The existence and accuracy of the predicted computations will be then tested on neural signals recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The potential findings of this project could lead us to suggest general principles of social learning, and we will be able to measure and model neural activation to show those general principles in action. In addition, our results could have important implications into policy-making - by revealing what type of information agents are naturally inclined to better learn from - and clinical practice - by outlining potential diagnostic procedures and behavioral therapies for disorders affecting social behavior.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UP-NORTH"><Rcn>192287</Rcn><Nid>13226</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>COLONISATION AND CULTURAL DIVERSIFICATION IN UNFAMILIAR LANDSCAPES</Name><PI>Rhiannon Stevens</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project explores the relationship between climate change and human behaviour. During the harshest conditions of the last ice age European human populations abandoned northern latitudes, with their range contracting to southern regions. By the time ice sheets retreated and large areas of land became available for resettlement there had been a hiatus of at least 7000 years.  This project examines the recolonisation of these Northern regions which took place during a period of rapid climate change, the last major global warming event on earth. As people move eastwards and northwards increasing diversification is seen in their stone and bone tool industries which indicate human development. This project examines whether climate a) drove the human dispersal and development, b) played a more indirect role, or c) was of little significance to humans at this time. State-of-the-art scientific techniques (radiocarbon dating, DNA, stable isotope, clumped isotope and charcoal ring width analyses) will be used to create integrated chronological, palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological frameworks that are directly linked to the Late and Final Palaeolithic archaeological record. Temporal and spatial trends in climate change, prey abundance and behaviour, and technological development will be compared and considered in light of regional and global climate trends and archaeological evidence for hunting strategies, human mobility and landscape use. Such data will provide an insight into the conditions Palaeolithic people experienced and how this influenced their perceptions of the landscape they inhabited and the decisions they made.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,510</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="iBias"><Rcn>189832</Rcn><Nid>11816</Nid><HI>Universiteit Antwerpen, Belgium</HI><Name>Understanding contemporary interest group politics: mobilization and strategies in multi-layered systems</Name><PI>Jan Beyers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This ERC program addresses an unsettled political science problem, namely how does the shifting of policymaking competencies to higher levels of government affect the opportunities of societal interests to seek representation. On this issue two completely different theoretical expectations exist. One the one hand, the Madisonian view entails that shifting competencies upwards is a healthy antidote to the powers of specific interests that may dominate smaller polities. Multi-levelness may also provide political opportunities as it enables actors to make strategic venue shifts when they are unable to attract the necessary attention at one venue. On the other hand, shifting policymaking upwards may seriously restrict the opportunities for diffuse interests, undermine encompassing forms of interest representation, and increase the barriers for local groups to gain attention. Instead of creating opportunities for all, multi-layered systems may decrease opportunities and reproduce or reinforce representational bias. One of the reasons why the implications of multi-layeredness are so poorly understood is the fact that political science has not developed a proper understanding of what representational bias means; some scholars see bias in terms of mobilization, while others conceive it in terms of the strategic interactions between organized interests and policymakers.

This ERC program will integrate theoretically, methodologically and empirically these different aspects of group politics, by taking explicitly into account the nature of multi-layered systems. The innovative character of it lies in the theoretical combination of mapping interest group community dynamics, with a more nuanced characterization of organizational form and an in-depth investigation of bias in terms of strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,655,263</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project></Projects>
