However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACOPS"><Rcn>111552</Rcn><Nid>10065</Nid><HI>Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena, Germany</HI><Name>Advanced Coherent Ultrafast Laser Pulse Stacking</Name><PI>Jens Limpert</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"An important driver of scientific progress has always been the envisioning of applications far beyond existing technological capabilities. Such thinking creates new challenges for physicists, driven by the groundbreaking nature of the anticipated application. In the case of laser physics, one of these applications is laser wake-field particle acceleration and possible future uses thereof, such as in collider experiments, or for medical applications such as cancer treatment. To accelerate electrons and positrons to TeV-energies, a laser architecture is required that allows for the combination of high efficiency, Petawatt peak powers, and Megawatt average powers. Developing such a laser system would be a challenging task that might take decades of aggressive research, development, and, most important, revolutionary approaches and innovative ideas.
The goal of the ACOPS project is to develop a compact, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective high-average and high-peak power ultra-short pulse laser concept.
The proposed approach to this goal relies on the spatially and temporally separated amplification of ultrashort laser pulses in waveguide structures, followed by coherent combination into a single train of pulses with increased average power and pulse energy. This combination can be realized through the coherent addition of the output beams of spatially separated amplifiers, combined with the pulse stacking of temporally separated pulses in passive enhancement cavities, employing a fast-switching element as cavity dumper.
Therefore, the three main tasks are the development of kW-class high-repetition-rate driving lasers, the investigation of non-steady state pulse enhancement in passive cavities, and the development of a suitable dumping element.
If successful, the proposed concept would undoubtedly provide a tool that would allow researchers to surpass the current limits in high-field physics and accelerator science."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,881,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACUITY"><Rcn>185678</Rcn><Nid>12314</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands</HI><Name>Algorithms for coping with uncertainty and intractability</Name><PI>Nikhil Bansal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The two biggest challenges in solving practical optimization problems are computational intractability, and the presence

Recently, there has been a huge progress in our understanding of intractability, based on spectacular algorithmic and lower bound techniques. For several problems, especially those with only local constraints, we can design optimum
approximation algorithms that are provably the best possible.
However, typical optimization problems usually involve complex global constraints and are much less understood. The situation is even worse for coping with uncertainty. Most of the algorithms are based on ad-hoc techniques and there is no deeper understanding of what makes various problems easy or hard.

This proposal describes several new directions, together with concrete intermediate goals, that will break important new ground in the theory of approximation and online algorithms. The particular directions we consider are (i) extend the primal dual method to systematically design online algorithms, (ii) build a structural theory of online problems based on work functions, (iii) develop new tools to use the power of strong convex relaxations and (iv) design new algorithmic approaches based on  non-constructive proof techniques.

understand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This
quest has two dimensions. The
theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to
problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when
and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different
philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent
years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections
between them.

In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between
algorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way.
On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration
to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other
NP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better.
On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit
lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive
new circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.

This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms
and computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead
to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better
understanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are
fundamental
but notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to
unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of
probabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater
dialogue between the two areas, with an exchange of ideas and techniques
which leads to accelerated progress in both, as well as a deeper understanding
of the nature of efficient computation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,274,496</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ASIBIA"><Rcn>185645</Rcn><Nid>12021</Nid><HI>University Of East Anglia, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Arctic sea ice, biogeochemistry and impacts on the atmosphere: Past, present, future</Name><PI>Roland Von Glasow</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The Arctic Ocean is a vast expanse of sea ice. Most of it is snow covered as are large continental regions for about half of the year. However, Global Change is arguably greatest in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen more than anywhere else in the last few decades. New record lows occurred in snow extent in June 2012 and sea ice extent in September 2012. Many observations show that widespread and sustained change is occurring in the Arctic driving this unique environmental system into a new state. This project focuses on the biogeochemical links between sea ice and snow and the composition and chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest ~10km of the atmosphere). This is an important topic because the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles, which scatter sunlight directly and influence cloud properties, play key roles for our climate. Additionally, changes in the composition of the troposphere also affect the so-called oxidation capacity, the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself from pollutants.
This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model. This will allow a breakthrough in our understanding of the importance of the changes for the composition and oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and climate and will allow us to calculate adjusted Greenhouse Warming Potentials that include these processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,192,911</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AUGURY"><Rcn>185668</Rcn><Nid>12026</Nid><HI>Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, France</HI><Name>Reconstructing Earth&#8217;s mantle convection</Name><PI>Nicolas Coltice</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowledge of the state of the Earth mantle and its temporal evolution is fundamental to a variety of disciplines in Earth Sciences, from the internal dynamics to its many expressions in the geological record (postglacial rebound, sea level change, ore deposit, tectonics or geomagnetic reversals). Mantle convection theory is the centerpiece to unravel the present and past state of the mantle. For the past 40 years considerable efforts have been made to improve the quality of numerical models of mantle convection. However, they are still sparsely used to estimate the convective history of the solid Earth, in comparison to ocean or atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction. The main shortcoming is their inability to successfully produce Earth-like seafloor spreading and continental drift self-consistently. Recent convection models have begun to successfully predict these processes (Coltice et al., Science 336, 335-33, 2012). Such breakthrough opens the opportunity to combine high-level data assimilation methodologies and convection models together with advanced tectonic datasets to retrieve Earth's mantle history. The scope of this project is to produce a new generation of tectonic and convection reconstructions, which are key to improve our understanding and knowledge of the evolution of the solid Earth. The development of sustainable high performance numerical models will set new standards for geodynamic data assimilation. The outcome of the AUGURY project will be a new generation of models crucial to a wide variety of disciplines."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AdOC"><Rcn>185666</Rcn><Nid>10729</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Advance Optical Clocks</Name><PI>Sebastien Andr&#233; Marcel Bize</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The proposed research program has three main objectives. The first and second objectives are to seek extreme precisions in optical atomic spectroscopy and optical clocks, and to use this quest as a mean of exploration in atomic physics. The third objective is to explore new possibilities that stem from extreme precision. These goals will be pursued via three complementary activities: #1: Search for extreme precisions with an Hg optical lattice clock. #2: Explore and exploit the rich Hg system, which is essentially unexplored in the cold and ultra-cold regime. #3: Identify new applications of clocks with extreme precision to Earth science. Clocks can measure directly the gravitational potential via Einstein&#8217;s gravitational redshift, leading to the idea of &#8220;clock-based geodesy&#8221;.
The 2 first activities are experimental and build on an existing setup, where we demonstrated the feasibility of an Hg optical lattice clock. Hg is chosen for its potential to surpass competing systems. We will investigate the unexplored physics of the Hg clock. This includes interactions between Hg atoms, lattice-induced light shifts, and sensitivity to external fields which are specific to the atomic species. Beyond, we will explore the fundamental limits of the optical lattice scheme. We will exploit other remarkable features of Hg associated to the high atomic number and the diversity of stable isotopes. These features enable tests of fundamental physical laws, ultra-precise measurements of isotope shifts, measurement of collisional properties toward evaporative cooling and quantum gases of Hg, investigation of forbidden transitions promising for measuring the nuclear anapole moment of Hg.
The third activity is theoretical and is aimed at initiating collaborations with experts in modelling Earth gravity. With this expertise, we will identify the most promising and realistic approaches for clocks and emerging remote comparison methods to contribute to geodesy, hydrology, oceanography, etc."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,946,432</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIGBAYES"><Rcn>192413</Rcn><Nid>13428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rich, Structured and Efficient Learning of Big Bayesian Models</Name><PI>Yee Whye Teh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>As datasets grow ever larger in scale, complexity and variety, there is an increasing need for powerful machine learning and statistical techniques that are capable of learning from such data. Bayesian nonparametrics is a promising approach to data analysis that is increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics.  Bayesian nonparametric models are highly flexible models with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that can be used to directly parameterise and learn about functions, densities, conditional distributions etc, and  have been successfully applied to regression, survival analysis, language modelling, time series analysis, and visual scene analysis among others.  However, to successfully use Bayesian nonparametric models to analyse the high-dimensional and structured datasets now commonly encountered in the age of Big Data, we will have to overcome a number of challenges.  Namely, we need to develop Bayesian nonparametric models that can learn rich representations from structured data, and we need computational methodologies that can scale effectively to the large and complex models of the future.  We will ground our developments in relevant applications, particularly to natural language processing (learning distributed representations for language modelling and compositional semantics) and genetics (modelling genetic variations arising from population, genealogical and spatial structures).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,918,092</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BLACARAT"><Rcn>111516</Rcn><Nid>10084</Nid><HI>Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Black Carbon in the Atmosphere: Emissions, Aging and Cloud Interactions"</Name><PI>Martin Gysel Beer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Atmospheric aerosol particles have been shown to impact the earth's climate because they scatter and absorb solar radiation (direct effect) and because they can modify the microphysical properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei (indirect effects). Radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols remains poorly quantified, thus leading to considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the earth&#8217;s climate response to the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC), mostly emitted by anthropogenic combustion processes and biomass burning, is an important component of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates show that BC may be the second strongest contributor (after CO2) to global warming. Adverse health effects due to particulate air pollution have also been associated with traffic-related BC particles. These climate and health effects brought BC emission reductions into the political focus of possible mitigation strategies with immediate and multiple benefits for human well-being.

Laboratory experiments aim at the physical and chemical characterisation of BC emissions from diesel engines and biomass burning under controlled conditions. A mobile laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art aerosol sensors will be used to determine the contribution of different BC sources to atmospheric BC loadings, and to investigate the evolution of the relevant BC properties with atmospheric aging during transport from sources to remote areas. The interactions of BC particles with clouds as a function of BC properties will be investigated with in-situ measurements by operating quantitative single particle instruments behind a novel sampling inlet, which makes selective sampling of interstitial, cloud droplet residual or ice crystal residual particles possible. Above experimental studies aim at improving our understanding of BC&#8217;s atmospheric life cycle and will be used in model simulations for quantitatively assessing the atmospheric impacts of BC."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,015</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

This project aims to deliver a step change improvement in our quantitative understanding of chemical exchanges between ocean, sea ice, snow and the atmosphere in polar regions, especially the Arctic and of Arctic tropospheric chemistry. Answering these fundamental questions is essential to predict future change in the Arctic and globally. To this end a unique sea ice chamber will be constructed in the laboratory and used to quantify exchange processes in sea ice. Furthermore a hierarchy of numerical models will be used, operating at different spatial and temporal scales and degree of process description from a very detailed 1D to a global Earth System model. This will allow a breakthrough in our understanding of the importance of the changes for the composition and oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and climate and will allow us to calculate adjusted Greenhouse Warming Potentials that include these processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,192,911</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AUGURY"><Rcn>185668</Rcn><Nid>12026</Nid><HI>Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, France</HI><Name>Reconstructing Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s mantle convection</Name><PI>Nicolas Coltice</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowledge of the state of the Earth mantle and its temporal evolution is fundamental to a variety of disciplines in Earth Sciences, from the internal dynamics to its many expressions in the geological record (postglacial rebound, sea level change, ore deposit, tectonics or geomagnetic reversals). Mantle convection theory is the centerpiece to unravel the present and past state of the mantle. For the past 40 years considerable efforts have been made to improve the quality of numerical models of mantle convection. However, they are still sparsely used to estimate the convective history of the solid Earth, in comparison to ocean or atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction. The main shortcoming is their inability to successfully produce Earth-like seafloor spreading and continental drift self-consistently. Recent convection models have begun to successfully predict these processes (Coltice et al., Science 336, 335-33, 2012). Such breakthrough opens the opportunity to combine high-level data assimilation methodologies and convection models together with advanced tectonic datasets to retrieve Earth's mantle history. The scope of this project is to produce a new generation of tectonic and convection reconstructions, which are key to improve our understanding and knowledge of the evolution of the solid Earth. The development of sustainable high performance numerical models will set new standards for geodynamic data assimilation. The outcome of the AUGURY project will be a new generation of models crucial to a wide variety of disciplines."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AdOC"><Rcn>185666</Rcn><Nid>10729</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Advance Optical Clocks</Name><PI>Sebastien Andr&#195;&#169; Marcel Bize</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The proposed research program has three main objectives. The first and second objectives are to seek extreme precisions in optical atomic spectroscopy and optical clocks, and to use this quest as a mean of exploration in atomic physics. The third objective is to explore new possibilities that stem from extreme precision. These goals will be pursued via three complementary activities: #1: Search for extreme precisions with an Hg optical lattice clock. #2: Explore and exploit the rich Hg system, which is essentially unexplored in the cold and ultra-cold regime. #3: Identify new applications of clocks with extreme precision to Earth science. Clocks can measure directly the gravitational potential via Einstein&#226;&#128;&#153;s gravitational redshift, leading to the idea of &#226;&#128;&#156;clock-based geodesy&#226;&#128;&#157;.
The 2 first activities are experimental and build on an existing setup, where we demonstrated the feasibility of an Hg optical lattice clock. Hg is chosen for its potential to surpass competing systems. We will investigate the unexplored physics of the Hg clock. This includes interactions between Hg atoms, lattice-induced light shifts, and sensitivity to external fields which are specific to the atomic species. Beyond, we will explore the fundamental limits of the optical lattice scheme. We will exploit other remarkable features of Hg associated to the high atomic number and the diversity of stable isotopes. These features enable tests of fundamental physical laws, ultra-precise measurements of isotope shifts, measurement of collisional properties toward evaporative cooling and quantum gases of Hg, investigation of forbidden transitions promising for measuring the nuclear anapole moment of Hg.
The third activity is theoretical and is aimed at initiating collaborations with experts in modelling Earth gravity. With this expertise, we will identify the most promising and realistic approaches for clocks and emerging remote comparison methods to contribute to geodesy, hydrology, oceanography, etc."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,946,432</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIGBAYES"><Rcn>192413</Rcn><Nid>13428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rich, Structured and Efficient Learning of Big Bayesian Models</Name><PI>Yee Whye Teh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>As datasets grow ever larger in scale, complexity and variety, there is an increasing need for powerful machine learning and statistical techniques that are capable of learning from such data. Bayesian nonparametrics is a promising approach to data analysis that is increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics.  Bayesian nonparametric models are highly flexible models with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that can be used to directly parameterise and learn about functions, densities, conditional distributions etc, and  have been successfully applied to regression, survival analysis, language modelling, time series analysis, and visual scene analysis among others.  However, to successfully use Bayesian nonparametric models to analyse the high-dimensional and structured datasets now commonly encountered in the age of Big Data, we will have to overcome a number of challenges.  Namely, we need to develop Bayesian nonparametric models that can learn rich representations from structured data, and we need computational methodologies that can scale effectively to the large and complex models of the future.

Radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols remains poorly quantified, thus leading to considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s climate response to the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC), mostly emitted by anthropogenic combustion processes and biomass burning, is an important component of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates show that BC may be the second strongest contributor (after CO2) to global warming. Adverse health effects due to particulate air pollution have also been associated with traffic-related BC particles. These climate and health effects brought BC emission reductions into the political focus of possible mitigation strategies with immediate and multiple benefits for human well-being.

Laboratory experiments aim at the physical and chemical characterisation of BC emissions from diesel engines and biomass burning under controlled conditions. A mobile laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art aerosol sensors will be used to determine the contribution of different BC sources to atmospheric BC loadings, and to investigate the evolution of the relevant BC properties with atmospheric aging during transport from sources to remote areas. The interactions of BC particles with clouds as a function of BC properties will be investigated with in-situ measurements by operating quantitative single particle instruments behind a novel sampling inlet, which makes selective sampling of interstitial, cloud droplet residual or ice crystal residual particles possible.

MBHs also powered quasars known to exist just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.

To have a full view of MBH formation and growth we have to look at the global process where galaxies form, as determined by the large-scale structure, on Mpc scales. On the other hand, the region where MBHs dominate the dynamics of gas and stars, and accretion occurs, is merely pc-scale. To study the formation of MBHs and their fuelling we must bridge from Mpc to pc scale in order to follow how galaxies influence MBHs and how in turn MBHs influence galaxies.
BLACK aims to connect the cosmic context to the nuclear region where MBHs reside, and to study MBH formation, feeding and feedback on their hosts through a multi-scale approach following the thread of MBHs from cosmological, to galactic, to nuclear scales. Analytical work guides and tests numerical simulations, allowing us to probe a wide dynamical range.

It plays a major role in the associated mechanisms leading to disease (stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, &#226;&#128;&#166;). In the last decade, cutting edge technologies, including two-photon scanning laser microscopy (TPSLM) and optical manipulation of blood flow, have produced huge amounts of anatomic and functional experimental data in normal and Alzheimer Disease (AD) mice. These require accurate, highly quantitative, physiologically informed modeling and analysis for any coherent understanding and for translating results between species.
In this context, our first aim is to develop a general methodological framework for physiologically informed microvascular fluid dynamics modeling, understood in a broad meaning, i.e. blood flow, molecule transport and resulting functional imaging signals or signal surrogates.
Our second aim is to validate this methodological framework by direct comparison of in vivo anatomical and functional TPSLM measurements with the simulation results based on the same anatomical data.
The third objective is to exploit these methodologies in order to identify the logic of the structure/function relationships of brain microcirculation and neurovascular coupling, in human health and disease, with a focus on the role of vascular factors in AD.
Specific hypotheses on how vascular changes in AD affect both vascular function and neurovascular coupling can be experimentally tested in animal models of AD. Crucially, similar anatomical (but not functional) data can be acquired in healthy and AD humans. This will enable us to model how AD-induced vascular alterations could affect human patients. Ultimately, it provides us with new avenues for design and/or evaluation of improved diagnosis/preventive/treatment strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,873</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BubbleBoost"><Rcn>185557</Rcn><Nid>12004</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Microfluidic bubbles for novel applications: acoustic laser and ultrasonically controlled swimming microrobots</Name><PI>Philippe, Guy, Marie Marmottant</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Microfluidic techniques developed since the year 2000 have now matured to provide a unique tool to produce large amounts of microbubbles that are not only finely tuned in size, but that can also be embedded in tiny microfabricated structures.

In the present proposal, we plan to take advantage of these novel microfabrication techniques to develop two innovative acoustic applications. These applications, which were out of reach without current techniques, are based on the use of microbubbles with a huge acoustic resonance. The project is structured in two parts that only differ in the way bubbles are embedded in microfluidic environments:

1) Arrays of bubbles: Acoustic Laser
This first part is the development of an acoustic laser, based on microbubbles trapped in a microfluidic circuit. To obtain the conditions for an acoustic laser, arrays of microbubbles will be designed so that they bubbles pulsate in phase, reemitting their energy coherently. The applications are novel systems for high ultrasonic emission power, or meta-materials that store vibration energy.

2) Mobile &#226;&#128;&#156;armoured&#226;&#128;&#157; bubbles:  swimming micro-robots remotely powered by ultrasound
The second part is the conception of ultrasonically activated microswimming devices, with microbubbles embedded within freely moving objects. Their application is to behave as carriers, such as drug carriers, activated at a distance, or to be active tracers that enhance mixing. Microswimmers are mechanical analogues to RFID devices (where electromagnetic vibration is converted into current), here sound is converted into motion at small scales.

Both parts include the same three complementary steps: step 1 is the 3D microfabrication of the geometry where bubbles are embedded, step 2 is their ultrasonic activation, and then step 3 is the optimisation of their resonance by a study of individual resonators.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,856,542</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAUSALPATH"><Rcn>191274</Rcn><Nid>10579</Nid><HI>Panepistimio Kritis, Greece</HI><Name>Next Generation Causal Analysis: Inspired by the Induction of Biological Pathways from Cytometry Data</Name><PI>Ioannis Tsamardinos</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Discovering the causal mechanisms of a complex system of interacting components is necessary in order to control it. Computational Causal Discovery (CD) is a field that offers the potential to discover causal relations under certain conditions from observational data alone or with a limited number of interventions/manipulations.

An important, challenging biological problem that may take decades of experimental work is the induction of biological cellular pathways; pathways are informal causal models indispensable in biological research and drug design. Recent exciting advances in flow/mass cytometry biotechnology allow the generation of large-sample datasets containing measurements on single cells, thus setting the problem of pathway learning suitable for CD methods.
CAUSALPATH builds upon and further advances recent breakthrough developments in CD methods to enable the induction of biological pathways from cytometry and other omics data. As a testbed problem we focus on the differentiation of human T-cells; these are involved in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer and thus, are targets of new drug development for a range of chronic diseases. The biological problem acts as our campus for general novel formalisms, practical algorithms, and useful tools development, pointing to fundamental CD problems: presence of feedback cycles, presence of latent confounding variables, CD from time-course data, Integrative Causal Analysis (INCA) of heterogeneous datasets and others.

Three features complement CAUSALPATH&#226;&#128;&#153;s approach: (A) methods development will co-evolve with biological wet-lab experiments periodically testing the algorithmic postulates, (B) Open-source tools will be developed for the non-expert, and (C) Commercial exploitation of the results will be sought out.

Deviations from this can be called
macroscopic quantum behavior. These phenomena have been experimentally verified with cavity Quantum
Electro Dynamics (QED), trapped ions, and superconducting Josephson junction systems. Recently, evidence
was obtained that also moving objects can display such behavior. These objects are micromechanical
resonators (MR), which can measure tens of microns in size and are hence quite macroscopic. The degree of
freedom is their vibrations: phonons.

I propose experimental research in order to push quantum mechanics closer to the classical world than ever
before. I will try find quantum behavior in the most classical objects, that is, slowly moving bodies. I will use
MR's, accessed via electrical resonators. Part of it will be in analogy to the previously studied macroscopic
systems, but with photons replaced by phonons. The experiments are done in a cryogenic temperature mostly
in dilution refrigerator. The work will open up new perspectives on how nature works, and can have
technological implications.

The first basic setup is the coupling of MR to microwave cavity resonators. This is a direct analogy to
optomechanics, and can be called circuit optomechanics. The goals will be phonon state transfer via a cavity
bus, construction of squeezed states and of phonon-cavity entanglement. The second setup is to boost the
optomechanical coupling with a Josephson junction system, and reach the single-phonon strong-coupling for
the first time. The third setup is the coupling of MR to a Josephson junction artificial atom. Here we will
access the MR same way as the motion of a trapped ions is coupled to their internal transitions. In this setup,
I am proposing to construct exotic quantum states of motion, and finally entangle and transfer phonons over
mm-distance via cavity-coupled qubits. I believe within the project it is possible to perform rudimentary Bell
measurement with phonons."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,004,283</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHRONOS"><Rcn>185535</Rcn><Nid>11965</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Perugia, Italy</HI><Name>A geochemical clock to measure timescales of volcanic eruptions</Name><PI>Diego Perugini</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The eruption of volcanoes appears one of the most unpredictable phenomena on Earth. Yet the situation is rapidly changing. Quantification of the eruptive record constrains what is possible in a given volcanic system. Timing is the hardest part to quantify.
The main process triggering an eruption is the refilling of a sub-volcanic magma chamber by a new magma coming from depth. This process results in magma mixing and provokes a time-dependent diffusion of chemical elements. Understanding the time elapsed from mixing to eruption is fundamental to discerning pre-eruptive behaviour of volcanoes to mitigate the huge impact of volcanic eruptions on society and the environment.
The CHRONOS project proposes a new method that will cut the Gordian knot of the presently intractable problem of volcanic eruption timing using a surgical approach integrating textural, geochemical and experimental data on magma mixing. I will use the compositional heterogeneity frozen in time in the rocks the same way a broken clock at a crime scene is used to determine the time of the incident. CHRONOS will aim to:
1) be the first study to reproduce magma mixing, by performing unique experiments constrained by natural data and using natural melts, under controlled rheological and fluid-dynamics conditions;
2) obtain unprecedented high-quality data on the time dependence of chemical exchanges during magma mixing;
3) derive empirical relationships linking the extent of chemical exchanges and the mixing timescales;
4) determine timescales of volcanic eruptions combining natural and experimental data.
CHRONOS will open a new window on the physico-chemical processes occurring in the days preceding volcanic eruptions providing unprecedented information to build the first inventory of eruption timescales for planet Earth. If these timescales can be linked with geophysical signals occurring prior to eruptions, this inventory will have an immense value, enabling precise prediction of volcanic eruptions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,993,813</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CIRQUSS"><Rcn>111475</Rcn><Nid>11831</Nid><HI>Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, France</HI><Name>Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics with Single Electronic and Nuclear Spins</Name><PI>Patrice Emmanuel Bertet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Electronic spins are usually detected by their interaction with electromagnetic fields at microwave frequencies. Since this interaction is very weak, only large ensembles of spins can be detected. In circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) on the other hand, artificial superconducting atoms are made to interact strongly with microwave fields at the single photon level, and quantum-limited detection of few-photon microwave signals has been developed.

The goal of this project is to apply the concepts and techniques of cQED to the detection and manipulation of electronic and nuclear spins, in order to reach a novel regime in which a single electronic spin strongly interacts with single microwave photons. This will lead to

1)	A considerable enhancement of the sensitivity of spin detection by microwave methods. We plan to detect resonantly single electronic spins in a few milliseconds. This could enable A) to perform electron spin resonance spectroscopy on few-molecule samples B) to measure the magnetization of various nano-objects at millikelvin temperatures, using the spin as a magnetic sensor with nanoscale resolution.

2)	Applications in quantum information science. Strong interaction with microwave fields at the quantum level will enable the generation of entangled states of distant individual electronic and nuclear spins, using superconducting qubits, resonators and microwave photons, as &#226;&#128;&#156;quantum data buses&#226;&#128;&#157; mediating the entanglement.

and finally, the control of the heat exchanged between electrons and photons by coherently tuning the coupling with the electromagnetic environment.

Among the rechargeable batteries, LIBs have the most potential because of their quick charging rate and high power and energy density. However, ageing of LIBs and the related capacity and power fade is a major concern. For the improvement and future development of batteries, computational modeling and design is an important complementary part to experimental testing which is expensive, time-consuming and sometimes unfeasible.

The computational framework will support the design and optimization of new anode, separator and cathode materials as well as their structure inside the battery. The measurable outcome of this research will be an open-source software package that can be used to support the design and optimization of LIBs.

Within the computational framework, different (mechanical-thermal-electro-chemical) fields will be linked over multiple scales: from fundamental physics to the design of new battery materials.

-The investigation of ultrafast, sub-femtosecond electron dynamics in small molecules is providing first results. Its extension to large molecules promises the unraveling of charge migration and energy transport in complex (bio)molecules.
-Matter-wave experiments of large molecules, with currently up to some hundred atoms, are testing the limits of quantum mechanics, particle-wave duality, and coherence. These metrology experiments also allow the precise measurement of molecular properties.
The principal obstacle for these and similar experiments in molecular sciences is the controlled production of samples of identical molecules in the gas phase. We will develop novel concepts and technologies for the manipulation of complex molecules, ranging from amino acids to proteins, viruses, nano-objects, and small cells: We will implement new methods to inject complex molecules into vacuum, to rapidly cool them, and to manipulate the motion of these cold gas-phase samples using combinations of external electric and electromagnetic fields. These external-field handles enable the spatial separation of molecules according to size, shape, and isomer.
The generated controlled samples are ideally suited for the envisioned precision experiments. We will exploit them to record atomic-resolution molecular movies using the European XFEL, as well as to investigate the limits of quantum mechanics using matter-wave interferometry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,982,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORPHO"><Rcn>185623</Rcn><Nid>12014</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; Paris Diderot-Paris 7, France</HI><Name>Theory of strongly correlated photonic systems</Name><PI>Cristiano Ciuti</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The physics of complex quantum systems with controllable interactions is emerging as a fundamental topic for a broad community, providing an opportunity to test theories of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems and opening interesting applications such as quantum simulators. Recently, in solid-state structures with effective photon-photon interactions the rich physics of quantum fluids of light has been explored, albeit not yet in the regime of strong photonic correlations. Exciting advances in cavity Quantum Electro-Dynamics (QED) and superconducting circuit QED make strong photon-photon interactions now accessible. A growing interest is focusing on lattices of coupled resonators, implementing Hubbard-like Hamiltonians for photons injected by pump driving fields. Similarly to electronic systems, the physics of large two-dimensional (2D) photonic lattices is a fundamental theoretical challenge in the regime of strong correlations. CORPHO has the ambition to develop novel scalable theoretical methods for 2D lattices of cavities, including spatially inhomogeneous driving and dissipation. The proposed methods are based on a hybrid strategy combining cluster mean-field theory and Wave Function Monte Carlo on a physical &#226;&#128;&#152;Corner&#226;&#128;&#153; of the Hilbert space in order to calculate the steady-state density matrix and the properties of the non-equilibrium phases. We will study 2D lattices with complex unit cells and &#226;&#128;&#152;fractional&#226;&#128;&#153; driving (only a fraction of the sites is pumped), a configuration that, according to recent preliminary studies, is expected to dramatically enhance and enrich quantum correlations.  We will also investigate the interplay between driving and geometric frustration in 2D lattices with polarization-dependent interactions. Finally, the quantum control of strongly correlated photonic systems will be explored, including quantum feedback processes, cooling of thermal fluctuations and switching between multi-stable phases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,378,440</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRELMAT"><Rcn>189842</Rcn><Nid>11810</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique, France</HI><Name>Predictive electronic structure calculations for materials with strong electronic correlations: long-range Coulomb interactions and many-body screening</Name><PI>Silke Biermann</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Materials with strong electronic Coulomb correlations present unique electronic properties such as exotic magnetism, charge or orbital order, or unconventional optical or transport properties, including superconductivity, thermoelectricity or metal-insulator transitions. The concerted behavior of the electrons in these ``correlated materials"" moreover leads to an extreme sensitivity to external stimuli such as changes in temperature, pressure, or external fields. This tuneability of even fundamental properties is both a harbinger for technological applications and a challenge to currently available theoretical methods: Indeed, these properties are the result of strong electron-electron interactions and subtle quantum correlations, and cannot be understood without a proper description of excited states.
The aim of the present project is to elaborate, implement and test new approaches to investigate the spectral and optical properties of correlated materials ``from first principles"", that is, without adjustable parameters. I will build on the success of state-of-the-art dynamical mean field-based electronic structure techniques, but aim at developing them into truly first-principles methods, where a full treatment of the long-range Coulomb interactions replaces the current practice of purely local Hubbard interaction parameters. My target materials are among the most interesting for modern technologies, such as transition metal oxides (with potential applications ranging from oxide electronics to battery materials) and rare earth compounds used as environmentally-responsible pigments.

Instead of massive magnetic kickers, bent thin crystals trapping particles within the crystal lattice planes are used. This type of beam manipulation opens new fields of investigation of fundamental interactions between particles and of coherent interactions between particles and matter. An experiment in connection to Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays study in Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s high atmosphere can be conducted.
Several TeV energy protons or ions are deflected towards a chosen target by the bent lattice planes only when the lattice planes are parallel to the incoming particles direction.
The three key ingredients of CRYSBEAM are:
- a goniometer based on piezoelectric devices that orients a bent finely-polished low-miscut silicon crystal with a high resolution and repeatability, monitoring its position with synthetic diamond sensors. Novel procedures in crystal manufacturing &amp; testing and cutting-edge mechanical solutions for motion technology in vacuum are developed;
- a silica screen that measures the deflected particles via Cherenkov radiation  emission in micrometric optical waveguides. These are obtained with an ultra-short laser micro-machining technique as for photonic devices used in quantum optics and quantum computing. The screen is a direct beam-imaging detector for a high radiation dose environment;
- a smart absorber, which simulates the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s atmosphere, where particles are smashed and secondary showers are initiated. This sets the path to measure hadronic cross sections at an energy relevant for cosmic rays investigation.
The R&amp;D for the various components of such a system are carried out within this project and direct tests at CERN Super Proton Synchrotron to be performed prior to the final installation in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN are proposed.

Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) allow us to see 98% of the way to the big bang, back to a time when the Universe was only a few hundred thousand years old. Other forthcoming data will probe the more local universe in great detail. To test different possible universe models we need accurate theoretical predictions for this data in each model, and new sampling methods to solve the inference problem.

CMB data is most powerful if combined with information from other sources, allowing us to test many possible models of the universes and constrain cosmological parameters. As more models and parameters can be constrained, and higher precision means that more small uncertain corrections need to be consistently modelled, the problem of inference becomes challenging. I propose to develop ground-breaking new sampling methods for testing models with many parameters. To do this I will find novel sampling techniques, make efficient use of qualitatively different properties of different parameters, and develop a new parallelized sampling code that can be run on-demand in the cloud, leveraging the power of potentially vast and cheap cloud computing facilities and freeing up dedicated supercomputers for the problems where they are really needed.

In addition my team will develop new accurate theoretical predictions for confrontation with data, including analysis of new non-linear processes that will be a major source of confusion for dark energy and early universe studies, as well as correlations between different data sets.

I am applying for 70% of my time and two ERC postdocs to tackle these challenges.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,372,496</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Critical"><Rcn>191993</Rcn><Nid>10717</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Behaviour near criticality</Name><PI>Martin Hairer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"One of the main challenges of modern mathematical physics is to understand the behaviour of systems at or near criticality. In a number of cases, one can argue heuristically that this behaviour should be described by a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation. Some examples of systems of interest are models of phase coexistence near the critical temperature, one-dimensional interface growth models, and models of absorption of a diffusing particle by random impurities. Unfortunately, the equations arising in all of these contexts are mathematically ill-posed. This is to the extent that they defeat not only ""standard"" stochastic PDE techniques (as developed by Da Prato / Zabczyk / R&#195;&#182;ckner / Walsh / Krylov / etc), but also more recent approaches based on Wick renormalisation of nonlinearities (Da Prato / Debussche / etc).

Over the past year or so, I have been developing a theory of regularity structures that allows to give a rigorous mathematical interpretation to such equations, which therefore allows to build the mathematical objects conjectured to describe the abovementioned systems near criticality. The aim of the proposal is to study the convergence of a variety of concrete microscopic models to these limiting objects. The main fundamental mathematical tools to be developed in this endeavour are a discrete analogue to the theory of regularity structures, as well as a number of nonlinear invariance principles.
If successful, the project will yield unique insight in the large-scale behaviour of a number of physically relevant systems in regimes where both nonlinear effects and random fluctuations compete with equal strength."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,526,234</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIDYMUS"><Rcn>188661</Rcn><Nid>12214</Nid><HI>Stichting Vu, Netherlands</HI><Name>MICROMACHINED OPTOMECHANICAL DEVICES: looking at cells, tissues, and organs... with a gentle touch</Name><PI>Davide Iannuzzi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Every time we grab an object to look at its geometrical details or to feel if it is hard or soft, we are ineluctably confronted with the limits of our senses. Behind its appearances, the object may still hide information that, encrypted in its microscopic features, remains undetected to our macroscopic assessment. In life sciences, those limits are more than just frustrating: they are an obstacle to study and detect life threatening conditions. Many different instruments may overcome those limits, but the vast majority of them rely either on &#226;&#128;&#156;sight&#226;&#128;&#157; (optics) or &#226;&#128;&#156;touch&#226;&#128;&#157; (mechanics) separately. On the contrary, I believe that it is from the combination of those two &#226;&#128;&#156;senses&#226;&#128;&#157; that we have more chances to tackle the future challenges of cell biology, tissue engineering, and medical diagnosis.

Inspired by this tantalizing perspective, and supported by a technology that I have brought from blackboard to market, I have now designed a scientific program to breach into the microscopic scale via an unbeaten path. The program develops along three projects addressing the three most relevant scales in life sciences: cells, tissues, and organs. In the first project, I will design and test a new optomechanical probe to investigate how a prolonged mechanical load on a brain cell of a living animal may trigger alterations in its Central Nervous System. With the second project, I will develop an optomechanical tactile instrument that can assess how subsurface tissues deform in response to a mechanical stroke &#226;&#128;&#147; a study that may change the way physicians look at tissue classification. For the third project, I will deliver an acousto-optical gas trace sensors so compact that can penetrate inside the lungs of an adult patient, where it could be used for early detection of pulmonary life threatening diseases.

Specific structures and conformational changes are linked to important functions in cell regulation. Understanding the principles that govern how small molecules such as natural metabolites or synthetic drugs modulate the nucleic acid structures is of prime importance for molecular biology and pharmacology. The field however suffers from the lack of suitable experimental tools to monitor all assemblies and structures formed when a small molecule encounters its targets.

The goal of my project is to develop unique mass spectrometry-based approaches to detect, quantify and characterize all these assemblies and structures.

MAP estimation algorithms such as graph cuts have transformed computer vision in the last decade; they are now routinely used and are also utilized in commercial systems.
Topics of this project fall into 3 categories.
Theoretically-oriented: Graph cut techniques come from combinatorial optimization. They can minimize a certain class of functions, namely submodular functions with unary and pairwise terms. Larger classes of functions can be minimized in polynomial time. A complete characterization of such classes has been established. They include k-submodular functions for an integer k _ 1.
I investigate whether such tools from discrete optimization can lead to more efficient inference algorithms for practical problems. I have already found an important application of k-submodular functions for minimizing Potts energy functions that are frequently used in computer vision. The concept of submodularity also recently appeared in the context of the task of computing marginals in graphical models, here discrete optimization tools could be used.
Practically-oriented: Modern techniques such as graph cuts and tree-reweighted message passing give excellent results for some graphical models such as with the Potts energies. However, they fail for more complicated models. I aim to develop new tools for tackling such hard energies. This will include exploring tighter convex relaxations of the problem.
Applications, sequence tagging problems: Recently, we developed new algorithms for inference in pattern-based Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) on a chain. This model can naturally be applied to sequence tagging problems; it generalizes the popular CRF model by giving it more flexibility. I will investigate (i) applications to specific tasks, such as the protein secondary structure prediction, and (ii) ways to extend the model.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,641,585</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DROUGHT-HEAT"><Rcn>185664</Rcn><Nid>12023</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate</Name><PI>Sonia Isabelle Seneviratne</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Land-climate interactions mediated through soil moisture and vegetation play a critical role in the climate system, in particular for the occurrence of extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves. They are, however, poorly constrained in current Earth System Models (ESMs), leading to large uncertainties in climate projections. These uncertainties affect the quality and accuracy of projections of temperature, water availability, and carbon concentrations, as well as that of projected impacts on agriculture, ecosystems, and health.

In the past years, in-situ and remote sensing-based datasets of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and energy and carbon fluxes have become increasingly available, providing untapped potential for reducing associated uncertainties in current climate models. The DROUGHT-HEAT project aims at innovatively exploiting these new information sources in order to 1) derive observations-based diagnostics to quantify and isolate the role of land-climate interactions in past extreme events (""Diagnostic Atlas""), 2) evaluate and improve current ESMs and constrain climate-change projections using the derived diagnostics, and 3) apply the newly gained knowledge to frontier developments in the attribution of climate extremes to land processes and their mitigation through ""land geoengineering"".

The DROUGHT-HEAT project integrates the newest land observational datasets with the latest stream of ESMs. Novel methodologies will be applied to extract functional relationships from the data, and identify key gaps in the ESMs' representation of underlying processes. These will build on physically-based relationships, machine learning tools, and model calibration. In addition, they will encompass the mapping and merging of derived diagnostics in space and time to reduce ""blank spaces"" in the datasets.

Cells sense mechanical cues to guide their migration. As opposed to passive materials, living cells actively respond to the mechanical stimuli of their environment through the transduction of mechanical information into biochemical signaling events. These responses, particularly to rigidity, include differentiation, migration and alterations in cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion and thus occur over a wide range of time and length scales. I propose to address the effect of substrate mechanical properties on cell migration using quantitative in vitro methods based on micro-fabrication and micro-mechanical techniques. My main objectives are to:
1/ Discover specific mechanisms that guide single cells toward stiffer substrates (a process known as durotaxis), investigate the range of stiffness-sensitive responses and determine the molecular mechanisms based on actin dynamics and cell adhesion assembly. 2/ Characterize the emergence of coordinated cell movements and thus how cells move in concert under external mechanical constraints. In addition to cell-substrate interactions, the role of cell-cell junctions is crucial in the transmission of mechanical signals over the cell population. By analyzing tissue dynamics at both mesoscopic and molecular scales, we hope to unravel how epithelial cell sheets mechanically integrate multiple adhesive cues to drive collective cell migration.3/ Elucidate the role of 3D mechanical environments in collective cell migration. In contrast to migration in 2D, cells in 3D must overcome the biophysical resistance of their surrounding milieu. Based on optical and innovative micro-fabrication techniques to modify the stiffness of 3D scaffolds, we will study its influence on cell migration modes and invasion.

Complimentary structure growth measurements will test Einstein's theory of Gravity on the largest scales possible. The large-scale clustering of galaxies will be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity, testing and constraining models of inflation.

Existing solutions are often &#226;&#128;&#156;ad-hoc&#226;&#128;&#157; and do not come with a formal security treatment.

The central objective of the ERCC project is to initiate an overarching formal treatment of cryptographic solutions for RCDs, particularly focusing on efficiency. The main conceptual novelty is to follow the concept of provable security. We intend to design new cryptographic protocols that have a mathematical proof of security (assuming the hardness of some mathematical problem) and are still competitive with constructions currently used on RCDs. While we certainly cannot hope that all our new provably secure constructions will be superior to existing ad-hoc constructions, recent preliminary research
results give rise to optimism. Concretely, we will base our new protocols on hard problems in ideal and structures lattices and we will study weaker (yet still realistic) security models for RCDs allowing for efficient instantiations."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,874,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ESTYMA"><Rcn>111547</Rcn><Nid>10073</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Excited state quantum dynamics in molecular aggregates: a unified description from biology to devices</Name><PI>Alessandro Troisi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The coherent dynamics of excitons in systems of biological interest and in organic materials can now be studied with advanced experimental techniques, including two dimensional electronic spectroscopy, with time resolution of few femtoseconds. The theory of open quantum systems, that should support the interpretation of these new experiments, has been developed in different contexts over the past 60 years but seems now very inadequate for the problems of current interest.  First of all, the systems under investigation are extremely complex and the most common approach, based on the development of phenomenological models, is often not very informative.  Many different models yield results in agreement with the experiments and there is no systematic way to derive these models or to select the best model among many.  Secondly, the quantum dynamics of excitons is so fast that one cannot assume that the dynamics of environment is much faster than the dynamics of the system, an assumption crucial for most theories.  A remedy to the current limitation is proposed here through the following research objectives.
(1) A general and automatic protocol will be developed to generate simple treatable models of the system from an accurate atomistic description of the same system based on computational chemistry methods.
(2) A professionally-written software will be developed to study the quantum dynamics of model Hamiltonians for excitons in molecular aggregates. This software will incorporate different methodologies and will be designed to be usable also by non-specialists in the theory of quantum open systems (e.g. spectroscopists, computational chemists).
(3) A broad number of problems will be studied with this methodology including (i) exciton dynamics in light harvesting complexes and artificial proteins and (ii) exciton dynamics in molecular aggregates of relevance for organic electronics devices."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,512,873</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ETASECS"><Rcn>185663</Rcn><Nid>12027</Nid><HI>Technion - Israel Institute Of Technology, Israel</HI><Name>Extremely Thin Absorbers for Solar Energy Conversion and Storage</Name><PI>Avner Rothschild</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>ETASECS aims at making a breakthrough in the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for solar-powered water splitting that can be readily integrated with PV cells to provide storage capacity in the form of hydrogen. It builds upon our recent invention for resonant light trapping in ultrathin films of iron oxide (a-Fe2O3), which enables overcoming the deleterious trade-off between light absorption and charge carrier collection efficiency. Although we recently broke the water photo-oxidation record by any a-Fe2O3 photoanode reported to date, the losses are still high and there is plenty of room for further improvements that will lead to a remakable enhancement in the performance of our photoanodes, reaching quantum efficiency level similar to state-of-the-art PV cells. ETASECS aims at reaching this ambitious goal, which is essential for demonstrating the competitiveness of PEC+PV tandem systems for solar energy conversion and storage. Towards this end WP1 will combine theory, modelling and simulations, state-of-the-art experimental methods and advanced diagnostic techniques in order to identify and quantify the different losses in our devices. This work will guide the optimization work in WP2 that will suppress the losses at the photoanode and insure optimal electrical and optical coupling of the PEC and PV cells. We will also explore advanced photon management schemes that will go beyond our current light trapping scheme by combining synergic optical and nanophotonics effects. WP3 will integrate the PEC and PV cells and test their properties and performance. WP4 will disseminate our progress and achievements in professional and public forums. The innovations that will emerge from this frontier research will be further pursued in proof of concept follow up investigations that will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology. Success along these lines holds exciting promises for ground breaking progress towards large scale deployment of solar energy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,150,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXONMR"><Rcn>185545</Rcn><Nid>12353</Nid><HI>The University Court Of The University Of St Andrews, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Exploiting 17O NMR Spectroscopy: Atomic-Scale Structure, Disorder and Dynamics in Solids"</Name><PI>Sharon Elizabeth Marie Ashbrook</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The fundamental importance of oxide-based systems in technology, energy materials, geochemistry and catalysis, and the presence of oxygen in many biomaterials, should have resulted in oxygen nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy emerging as a vital tool for materials characterization. NMR offers an element-specific, atomic-scale probe of the local environment, providing a potentially powerful probe of local structure, disorder and dynamics in solids. However, despite the almost ubiquitous presence of oxygen in inorganic solids, oxygen NMR studies have been relatively scarce in comparison to other nuclei, owing primarily to the low natural abundance of the  NMR-active isotope, 17O (0.037%). Hence, isotopic enrichment is necessary, often at considerable cost and effort. Furthermore, the presence of anisotropic quadrupolar broadening (and the need for complex high-resolution experiments) has also limited the development and application of 17O NMR to date. Here, we propose to develop an internationally-leading research programme to exploit the largely untapped potential of 17O spectroscopy. This wide-ranging programme will involve (i) the exploration of novel synthetic approaches for cost-efficient isotopic enrichment, (ii) the development of new solid-state NMR methodology, specific for 17O, (iii) the application of state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of 17O NMR parameters and (iv) the application of these methods to three different areas of investigation: high-pressure silicate minerals, microporous materials and ceramics for waste encapsulation. The ultimate long-term aim is to change the way in which solid-state chemists characterise materials; so that solid-state NMR (and 17O NMR in particular) is viewed as a necessary and important step in the refinement of a detailed structural model."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,902,188</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXQUISITE"><Rcn>185601</Rcn><Nid>10746</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>External Quantum Control of Photonic Semiconductor Nanostructures</Name><PI>Stephan Erich Reitzenstein</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In this project, we will control photonic nanostructures by external feedback, optical injection and synchronization.

In a) we will advance the concepts of time-delayed coupling in standard semiconductor laser diodes to few photon states, where quantum fluctuations contribute to or even dominate over the usual classical dynamics. Feedback-coupling in microlasers will allow us to explore the limits of a classical description of chaotic laser dynamics via the Lang-Kobayashi rate equations and to develop an advanced model taking cQED- and QD-specific effects into account. This subject will be complemented by the study of optical injection of coherent light and non-classical light into microlasers to influence and study mode-locking, chaos and stimulated emission down to the quantum level. Single photon feedback in b) will be applied to stabilize coherent coupling of light and matter and to act against decoherence which constitutes a major bottleneck for application of semiconductor nanostructures in quantum information technology. In c) the mutual coupling of microlasers will be used to study synchronization of chaotic quantum devices at the single photon limit and to explore the underlying physics of isochronal synchronization.

A better understanding of continental deformation can mitigate these hazards. However, the coupling between climate and tectonic interactions at plate corners is a key unknown and the focus of this study. My recent work, published in international journals including Science and Nature, quantifies mountain building and climate change and provides a baseline for an innovative study of plate corner dynamics.
This proposal challenges the geoscience &#226;&#128;&#152;tectonic aneurysm&#226;&#128;&#153; paradigm that rapid deformation and erosion at plate corners is initiated from the &#226;&#128;&#156;top down&#226;&#128;&#157; by localized precipitation, and erosion. Rather, I hypothesize that these processes are: 1) initiated from the &#226;&#128;&#156;bottom up&#226;&#128;&#157; by the 3D geometry of the subducting plate; and 2) require a threshold rate of both &#226;&#128;&#156;bottom up&#226;&#128;&#157; deformation and surface erosion to initiate a feedback between climate and tectonics.
I propose, for the first time, a holistic modeling and data collection approach that quantifies the temporal and spatial evolution of all aspects of plate corner evolution, including: 3D thermomechanical modeling of plate corner deformation and uplift for different plate geometries; Atmospheric modeling to quantify the climate response to evolving topography, a topic spearheaded by my research group; And surface process modeling to close the loop and couple the atmospheric and mechanical models. Model predictions will be vetted against observed deformation and erosion histories from existing and new cosmogenic isotope and thermochronometer data from end-member locations including the Himalaya, Alaskan, Olympic, and Andean plate corners.

However little is known about those planets we have detected beyond the fact they exist and their location. For a minority, we know their weight, size and orbital parameters. For less than twenty, we have some clues about their atmospheric temperature and composition. How do we progress from here?
We are still far from a hypothetical Hertzsprung&#226;&#128;&#147;Russell diagram for planets and we do not even know whether there ever will be such classification for planets. The planetary parameters mass, radius and temperature alone do not explain the diversity revealed by current observations. The chemical composition of these planets is needed to trace back their formation history and evolution, as was the case for the Solar System.
Pioneering results were obtained through transit spectroscopy with Hubble, Spitzer and ground-based facilities, enabling the detection of ionic, atomic and molecular species and of the planet&#226;&#128;&#153;s thermal structure. With the arrival of improved or dedicated instruments in the coming decade, planetary science will expand beyond the narrow boundaries of our Solar System to encompass our whole Galaxy.
In the next five years, ExoLights will address the following fundamental questions:
&#226;&#128;&#147; Why are exoplanets as they are?
&#226;&#128;&#147; What are the causes for the observed diversity?
&#226;&#128;&#147; Can their formation history be traced back from their current composition and evolution?
New spectroscopic observations of a select sample of exoplanets&#226;&#128;&#153; atmospheres (~ 20 out of the 150 observable today) will be analysed with state-of-the art statistical techniques and interpreted through a comprehensive set of spectral retrieval models, developed by the PI and her team.

Semidefinite programming  surpasses linear programming in terms of expressivity while remaining tractable. This project proposal investigates the modeling power of linear and semidefinite programming, in the context of combinatorial optimization. Within the emerging framework of extended formulations (EFs), I seek a decisive answer to the following question: Which problems can be modeled by a linear or semidefinite program, when the number of constraints and variables are limited? EFs are based on the idea that one should choose the ""right"" variables to model a problem. By extending the set of variables of a problem by a few carefully chosen variables, the number of constraints can in some cases dramatically decrease, making the problem easier to solve. Despite previous high-quality research, the theory of EFs is still on square one. This project proposal aims at (i) transforming our current zero-dimensional state of knowledge to a truly three-dimensional state of knowledge by pushing the boundaries of EFs in three directions (models, types and problems); (ii) using EFs as a lens on complexity by proving strong consequences of important conjectures such as P != NP, and leveraging strong connections to geometry to make progress on the log-rank conjecture.

Often, these data are collected for no specific purpose, or they turn out to be useful for unanticipated purposes: Companies constantly look for new ways to monetize their customer databases; Governments mine various databases to detect tax fraud; Security agencies mine and cross-associate numerous heterogeneous information streams from publicly accessible and classified databases to understand and detect security threats. The objective in such Exploratory Data Mining (EDM) tasks is typically ill-defined, i.e. it is unclear how to formalize how interesting a pattern extracted from the data is. As a result, EDM is often a slow process of trial and error.

During this fellowship we aim to develop the mathematical principles of what makes a pattern interesting in a very subjective sense. Crucial in this endeavour will be research into automatic mechanisms to model and duly consider the prior beliefs and expectations of the user for whom the EDM patterns are intended, thus relieving the users of the complex task to attempt to formalize themselves what makes a pattern interesting to them.

This project will represent a radical change in how EDM research is done. Currently, researchers typically imagine a specific purpose for the patterns, try to formalize interestingness of such patterns given that purpose, and design an algorithm to mine them. However, given the variety of users, this strategy has led to a multitude of algorithms. As a result, users need to be data mining experts to understand which algorithm applies to their situation. To resolve this, we will develop a theoretically solid framework for the design of EDM systems that model the user's beliefs and expectations as much as the data itself, so as to maximize the amount of useful information transmitted to the user. This will ultimately bring the power of EDM within reach of the non-expert."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,549,315</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GALACTICNUCLEUS"><Rcn>191264</Rcn><Nid>11235</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior Deinvestigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>The Fingerprint of a Galactic Nucleus: A Multi-Wavelength, High-Angular Resolution, Near-Infrared Study of the Centre of the Milky Way</Name><PI>Rainer Sch&#195;&#182;del</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Galactic stellar nuclei are very common in all types of galaxies and are marked by the presence of nuclear star clusters, the densest and most massive star clusters in the present-day Universe. Their formation is still an unresolved puzzle. The centre of the Milky Way contains a massive black hole and a stellar nucleus and is orders of magnitude closer than any comparable target. It is the only galactic nucleus and the most extreme astrophysical environment that we can examine on scales of milli-parsecs. It is therefore a crucial laboratory for studying galactic nuclei and their role in the context of galaxy evolution. Yet, suitable data that would allow us to examine the stellar component of the Galactic Centre exist for less than 1% of its projected area. Moreover, the well-explored regions are extraordinary, like the central parsec around the massive black hole, and therefore probably not representative for the overall environment. Fundamental questions on the stellar population, structure and assembly history of the Galactic Centre remain therefore unanswered. This project aims at addressing the open questions by obtaining accurate, high-angular resolution, multi-wavelength near-infrared photometry for an area of several 100 pc^2, a more than ten-fold increase compared to the current state of affairs. The Galactic Centre presents unique observational challenges because of a combination of high extinction and extreme stellar crowding. It is therefore not adequately covered by existing or upcoming imaging surveys. I present a project that is specifically tailored to overcome these observational challenges. In particular, I have developed a key technique to obtain the necessary sensitive, high-angular resolution images with a stable point spread function over large, crowded fields. It works with a range of existing ground-based instruments and will serve to complement existing data to provide a global and detailed picture of the stellar nucleus of the Milky Way.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,547,657</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GCGXC"><Rcn>188653</Rcn><Nid>12231</Nid><HI>The University Court Of The University Of St Andrews, United Kingdom</HI><Name>GenoChemetics: Gene eXpression enabling selective Chemical functionalisation of natural products</Name><PI>Rebecca Jane Miriam Goss</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"We aim to consolidate a trans-disciplinary research programme in which synthetic biology is harnessed to enable synthetic chemistry.

There is an urgent need for the discovery and development of new drugs and in particular new antibiotics. More than 13 million lives worldwide are currently claimed each year due to infectious diseases. Natural products provide an unparalleled starting point for drug discovery, with over 60% of anticancer agents and over 70% of antibiotics entering clinical trials in the last three decades being based on such compounds.  In order to gain a full understanding as to how a drug works and in order to be able to generate compounds with improved biological activity and physicochemical properties the generation of analogues is essential. In recent years pharmaceutical industries have shied away from natural products due to the perceived synthetic intractability of libraries of natural product analogues and the misperception that it is not possible to carry out thorough structure activity relationship (SAR) assessment on such compounds. As a result of largely abandoning natural products, industries&#226;&#128;&#153; drug discovery pipelines are beginning to run dry; this is a particular concern when faced with the need to combat the ever-increasing problem of drug resistance and infectious disease.

Historically such spaces first arose in the study of systems of analytic differential equations. Closely related, and in fact locally homeomorphic, are deformation spaces of locally homogeneous geometric structures. Such deformation spaces often arise as solutions to basic geometric problems, and their global properties provide powerful topological invariants, in particular for three- and four-dimensional manifolds.
Due to the ubiquity of these spaces, methods and viewpoints from various areas of mathematics such as dynamical systems, algebraic geometry, gauge theory, representation theory, partial differential equations, number theory and complex analysis can be combined, and their interplay gives rise to the richness of this subject. In recent year there has also been an increasing interaction with theoretical physics, which has been fruitful for both sides.
In recent years the deformation theory of geometric structures has received revived attention due to new developments, which involve in a deeper way the connections to Lie theory and gauge theory. Unexpectedly, many new examples of deformation spaces of geometric structures appeared. Two such developments are Higher Teichmueller theory and Anosov representations of hyperbolic groups, which generalize classical Teichmueller theory and the theory of quasi-Fuchsian representations to the context of Lie groups of higher rank.
The goal of the proposal is to understand the fine structure and internal geometry of deformation spaces of geometric structures, and to further develop the structure theory of discrete subgroups in higher rank Lie groups.

In recent years, striking results were obtained in those disciplines with the help of a surprise newcomer at the border between mathematics and logic: Model Theory. Bringing its unique point of view and its powerful formalism, Model Theory made a resounding entry into several different fields of mathematics. Here shedding new light on a classical phenomenon, there solving a long-standing open problem via a completely new method.

Recent examples of concrete mathematical problems where Model Theory interacted in a fruitful manner abound: the local version of Hilbert's 5th problem by Goldbring and van den Dries, Szemeredi's theorems in combinatorics and graph theory, the Andr&#195;&#169;-Oort conjecture in diophantine geometry (Pila, Wilkie, Zannier), etc. In this vein, and building on Hrushovski's model-theoretic work, Green, Tao and myself recently settled a conjecture of Lindenstrauss pertaining to the structure of approximate groups.

Our plan in this project is to put these methods into further use, to collaborate with model theorists, and to start looking through this prism at a small collection of familiar problems coming from combinatorics, group theory, analysis and spectral geometry of metric spaces, or from arithmetic geometry. Among them: extend our study of approximate groups to the general setting of locally compact groups, obtain uniform estimates on the spectrum of Cayley graphs of large finite groups, prove an analogue for character varieties of the Pink-Zilber conjectures in relation with rigidity theory for discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and clarify the links between uniform spectral gaps and height lower bounds in diophantine geometry with a view towards Lehmer's conjecture.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,284,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GLYCOSURF"><Rcn>185563</Rcn><Nid>12343</Nid><HI>The University Of Birmingham, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Surface-Based Molecular Imprinting for Glycoprotein Recognition</Name><PI>Paula Maria Da Silva Mendes</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"There is now overwhelming evidence that glycosylation changes during the development and progression of various malignancies. Altered glycosylation has been implicated in cancer, immune deficiencies, neurodegenerative diseases, hereditary disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, antibodies are playing a central role in enabling the detection of glycoprotein biomarkers using a variety of immunodiagnostic tests. Nonetheless, antibodies do have their own set of drawbacks that limit the commercialization of antibody sensing technology. They suffer from poor stability, need special handling and require a complicated, costly production procedure. More importantly, they lack specificity because they bind only to a small site on the biomarker and are not able to discriminate, for instance, among different glycosylated proteins. The current antibody diagnostic technology has well recognized limitations regarding their accuracy and timeliness of diagnose of disease.

The main reason for this progress consists in the apparent exact integrability of the models in the planar limit. Integrability is a hidden symmetry which allows to establish very efficient tools for performing calculations. Remarkably, these tools not only conveniently compute observables at very high orders in the coupling constant, both at weak and at strong coupling, but they also make quantitative predictions at finite coupling strength. A similar amount of progress is due to the development of novel on-shell techniques which allow to construct scattering amplitudes at several loop orders. They become especially powerful when combined with the extended symmetries related to integrability.

The aim of the project is to put the recent rapid progress in integrability and scattering amplitudes on a solid foundation. By enhancing the encountered symmetries and applications towards more realistic gauge and gravity theories we hope to obtain new tools for QFT in general as well as new clues for the problem of quantum gravity.

More concretely, we will work out a precise formulation for the algebra underlying integrability. This is a crucial step towards proving integrability in AdS/CFT and to justify and develop efficient methods. Furthermore, we plan to develop applications of integrability away from the planar limit and for non-integrable gauge theories. Finally, we will extend these methods and considerations to gravity models. We will also take a fresh look at alternative models with a view to solving the puzzle of quantum gravity.

We plan to address these important objectives with the common framework of extended symmetries and powerful calculational techniques for scattering amplitudes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,660,804</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HAPDEGMT"><Rcn>111545</Rcn><Nid>10072</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior Deinvestigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>Harmonic Analysis, Partial Differential Equations and Geometric Measure Theory</Name><PI>Jose Maria Martell Berrocal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The origin of Harmonic Analysis goes back to the study of the heat diffusion, modeled by a differential equation, and the claim made by Fourier that every periodic function can be represented as a series of sines and cosines. In this statement we can find the motivation to many of the advances that have been made in this field. Partial Differential Equations model many phenomena from the natural, economic and social sciences. Existence, uniqueness, convergence to the boundary data, regularity of solutions, a priori estimates, etc.,  can be studied for a given PDE.  Often, Harmonic Analysis plays an important role in such problems and, when the scenarios are not very friendly, Harmonic Analysis turns out to be fundamental. Not very friendly scenarios are those where one lacks of smoothness either in the coefficients of the PDE and/or in the domains where the PDE is solved. Some of these problems lead to obtain the boundedness of certain singular integral operators and this drives one to the classical and modern Calder&#195;&#179;n-Zygmund theory, the paradigm of Harmonic Analysis. When studying the behavior of the solutions of the given PDE near the boundary, one needs to understand the geometrical features of the domains and then Geometric Measure Theory jumps into the picture.

This ambitious project lies between the interface of three areas: Harmonic Analysis, PDE and Geometric Measure theory. It seeks  deep results motivated by elliptic  PDE using techniques from Harmonic Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory.This project is built upon results obtained by the applicant in these three areas. Some of them are very recent and have gone significantly beyond the state of the art. The methods to be used have been shown to be very robust and therefore they might be useful towards its applicability in other regimes. Crucial to this project is the use of Harmonic Analysis where the applicant has already obtained important contributions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,429,790</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HEART"><Rcn>189824</Rcn><Nid>11821</Nid><HI>Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet  Zu Kiel, Germany</HI><Name>"The Highly Efficient And Reliable smart Transformer (HEART), a new Heart for the Electric Distribution System"</Name><PI>Marco Liserre</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"In the last 10 years, power electronics has moved significantly towards the electric grid, making it more flexible and decentralized. Still important challenges remain. One of the most thrilling is re-inventing the distribution transformer after more than 125 years since its first use in the electrification of a city. In fact, actual distribution transformers can no longer fulfill the requirements of a modern electric grid highly dominated by distributed sources and new sizable loads, like heat pumps and electric vehicles.
This project proposes the invention of a novel &#226;&#128;&#156;Smart Transformer&#226;&#128;&#157; (ST), based on a modular architecture of units made by power electronics converters, that will be able to manage the energy and the information flows among sources and loads in the distribution area with the goal of decoupling it from the rest of the bulk power system. Actual proposals of Smart Transformers cannot compete in terms of cost, efficiency and reliability with traditional transformers.
This project has decided to take this challenge with a paradigm shift in how to approach it and a new set of methodologies. The breakthrough results of this research will be obtained taking the following high-risk high-gain bet: significantly influence the efficiency and the reliability of the Smart Transformer by routing the energy flows among its power converter units. A new understanding of how the energy flows are managed by the modular connection of power converter units will guide the design of new architectures for the ST allowing different routes for the energy. Graph theory will be used to find optimal paths for the energy flows with the goal of maximizing efficiency and reliability. The energy flows will be managed by relying on information coming from the electric distribution system sensors (requirements) and from the power module sensors (constraints).
The holy grail of this research is to provide a new durable heart to the electric distribution system."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,720</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HELENA"><Rcn>191297</Rcn><Nid>10578</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands</HI><Name>Heavy-Element Nanowires</Name><PI>Erik Petrus Antonius Maria Bakkers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Nanowires are a powerful and versatile platform for a broad range of applications. Among all semiconductors, the heavy-elements materials exhibit the highest electron mobilities, strongest spin-orbit coupling and best thermoelectric properties. Nonetheless, heavy-element nanowires have been unexplored. With this proposal we unite the unique advantages of design freedom of nanowires with the special properties of heavy-element semiconductors. We specifically reveal the potential of heavy-element nanowires in the areas of thermoelectrics, and topological insulators. Using our strong track record in this area, we will pioneer the synthesis of this new class of materials and study their intrinsic materials properties. Starting point are nanowires of InSb and PbTe grown using the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. Our aims are 1) to obtain highest-possible electron mobilities for these bottom-up fabricated materials by investigating new materials combinations of different semiconductor classes to effectively passivate the nanowire surface and we will eliminate impurities; 2) to investigate and optimize thermoelectric properties by developing advanced superlattice and core/shell nanowire structures where electronic and phononic transport is decoupled; and 3) to fabricate high-quality planar nanowire networks, which enable four-point electronic transport measurements and allow precisely determining carrier concentration and mobility. Besides the fundamentally interesting materials science, the heavy-element nanowires will have major impact on the fields of renewable energy, new (quasi) particles and quantum information processing.

The LHC was successful in discovering a particle compatible with the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). However expectations to discover New Physics have not been met so far.

In order to establish whether the new resonance is the SM Higgs boson, or not, precise measurements of its properties are mandatory. These require accurate predictions for cross-sections involving the Higgs boson, as well as for SM backgrounds, that need to be subtracted accurately. Furthermore, since so far New Physics has been elusive, it will be even more important to extend the range of these searches as much as possible. This requires a solid control of SM backgrounds.

This project aims at pushing the frontier of precision QCD calculations to reach an unprecedented precision for collider
processes. The project is divided into two main parts.

In the first part the PI will formulate a general procedure to merge different calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) level. This will lead to the construction of an event generator for two-to-one and two-to-two scattering processes at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), including parton shower corrections, essentially upgrading the POWHEG NLO generator to the NNLO level. Depending on the process considered, a significant reduction of the theoretical errors, by a factor 2-4, will be achieved.

The second part focuses on extending the accuracy of resummed predictions for important QCD observables from next-to-leading logarithmic to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level, again achieving a substantial reduction of the theoretical error. The observables considered include, besides event-shapes and jet-rates, also jet-veto predictions in Higgs + 1 or 2 jet events.

Besides the groundbreaking impact on present LHC physics measurements, these results will also be essential to match the high accuracy of measurements at a future linear collider."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,514,798</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HIGEOM"><Rcn>185633</Rcn><Nid>12325</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Pavia, Italy</HI><Name>Highly accurate Isogeometric Method</Name><PI>Giancarlo Sangalli</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are widely used  in science and engineering simulations, often in tight connection with  Computer Aided Design (CAD). The Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of  the most popular technique for the discretization of PDEs. The IsoGeometric Method (IGM), proposed in 2005 by T.J.R. Hughes et al.,  aims at improving the interoperability between CAD and FEMs. This is achieved by adopting the CAD mathematical primitives, i.e. Splines and Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), both for geometry  and unknown fields representation. The IGM has gained an incredible momentum especially in the engineering community. The use of high-degree, highly smooth NURBS is extremely successful and the IGM outperforms the FEM in most academic benchmarks.

However, we are far from having a satisfactory mathematical understanding of the IGM and, even more importantly, from exploiting its full potential. Until now, the IGM theory and practice have been deeply influenced by finite element analysis. For example, the IGM is implemented resorting to a FEM code design,  which is  very inefficient for high-degree and high-smoothness NURBS. This has made possible a fast spreading of the IGM, but also limited it to quadratic or cubic NURBS  in complex simulations.

The use of higher degree IGM for real-world applications asks for new tools allowing for the efficient construction and solution of the linear system, time integration, flexible local mesh refinement,  and so on. These questions need to be approached beyond the FEM framework. This is possible  only on solid mathematical grounds,  on a new theory of splines and NURBS able to comply with the needs of the IGM.

This project will provide the crucial knowledge and will re-design  the IGM to make it a superior, highly accurate and stable methodology, having a significant impact in the field of numerical simulation of PDEs, particularly when accuracy is essential both in geometry and fields representation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>928,188</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HIPS"><Rcn>188662</Rcn><Nid>10640</Nid><HI>Bar Ilan University, Israel</HI><Name>High-Performance Secure Computation with Applications to Privacy and Cloud Security</Name><PI>Yehuda Lindell</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Secure two-party and multiparty computation has long stood at the center of the foundations of theoretical cryptography. However, in the last five years there has been blistering progress on the question of efficient secure computation. We are close to the stage that secure computation can be applied to real-world privacy and security problems. There is thus considerable interest in secure computation solutions from governments, military and security organisations, and industry. However, in order to answer the needs of secure computation in practice, there is still a need to make secure computation protocols much faster.

Until now, research in efficient cryptographic protocols has typically been in two different directions. The first direction, and the major one, is to construct more efficient protocols and prove them secure, where efficiency is measured by the amount of communication sent, the number of heavy cryptographic operations carried out (e.g., exponentiations), and so on. The second direction is to take the state-of-the-art protocols and implement them while optimising the implementation based on systems concerns. This latter direction has proven to improve the efficiency of existing protocols significantly, but is limited since it remains within the constraints of existing cryptographic approaches.

We propose a synergetic approach towards achieving high-performance secure computation. We will design new protocols while combining research from cryptography, algorithms and systems. In this way, issues like load balancing, memory management, cache-awareness, bandwidth bottlenecks, utilisation of parallel computing resources, and more, will be built into the cryptographic protocol and not considered merely as an afterthought. If successful, HIPS will enable the application of the beautiful theory of secure computation to the problems of privacy in the digital era, cloud security and more."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,175</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HeteroIce"><Rcn>185619</Rcn><Nid>10730</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Towards a molecular-level understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation</Name><PI>Angelos Michaelides</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Ice formation is one of the most common phase transitions on Earth. It is relevant to an enormous variety of phenomena such as weathering, cloud formation, airline safety, agriculture, and energy. However, despite having been studied since antiquity, our molecular level understanding of ice formation is largely incomplete. In particular, almost all ice formation in nature is aided by impurities or the surfaces of foreign materials, yet how surfaces act to facilitate ice formation (heterogeneous ice nucleation) is unclear. Given the ubiquity of ice nucleation, this is arguably one of the biggest unsolved problems in the physical sciences.

Experiment provides insight into crystal nucleation and growth, but most nucleation events happen too quickly and involve too few particles to be rationalised purely by experiment. As a result, computer simulations play an important role and I believe we are now on the verge of using simulation to bring about major breakthroughs in understanding ice formation. Specifically, in this project we aim to perform the first full-on attack on heterogeneous ice nucleation so as to elucidate how the physiochemical properties of materials control their ability to nucleate ice. We will focus on nucleation on solid inorganic substrates and our approach will be to couple systematic studies on model systems with in-depth explorations of more realistic (and experimentally realisable) surfaces. We will improve existing computer simulation methods and develop new ones for accurate large- scale simulations of phase transitions in complex heterogeneous environments. In so doing we will help to make simulations of ice nucleation more routine, enabling us to establish what makes a good ice nucleating agent. The results from this multi-disciplinary project will not only shed light on an important everyday process but may also help to improve climate models and develop improved cloud seeding materials, or inhibitor coatings for industrial purposes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,915,083</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HoloQosmos"><Rcn>191232</Rcn><Nid>11904</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Holographic Quantum Cosmology</Name><PI>Thomas Hertog</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The current theory of cosmic inflation is largely based on classical physics. This undermines its predictivity in a world that is fundamentally quantum mechanical. With this project we will develop a novel approach towards a quantum theory of inflation. We will do this by introducing holographic techniques in cosmology. The notion of holography is the most profound conceptual breakthrough that has emerged form fundamental high-energy physics in recent years. It postulates that (quantum) gravitational systems such as the universe as a whole have a precise `holographic&#226;&#128;&#153; description in terms of quantum field theories defined on their boundary. Our aim is to develop a holographic framework for quantum cosmology. We will then apply this to three areas of theoretical cosmology where a quantum approach is of critical importance. First, we will put forward a holographic description of inflation that clarifies its microphysical origin and is rigorously predictive. Using this we will derive the distinct observational signatures of novel, truly holographic models of the early universe where inflation has no description in terms of classical cosmic evolution. Second, we will apply holographic cosmology to improve our understanding of eternal inflation. This is a phase deep into inflation where quantum effects dominate the evolution and affect the universe&#226;&#128;&#153;s global structure. Finally we will work towards generalizing our holographic models of the primordial universe to include the radiation, matter and vacuum eras. The resulting unification of cosmic history in terms of a single holographic boundary theory may lead to intriguing predictions of correlations between early and late time observables, tying together the universe&#226;&#128;&#153;s origin with its ultimate fate. Our project has the potential to revolutionize our perspective on cosmology and to further deepen the fruitful interaction between cosmology and high-energy physics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HydroSync"><Rcn>188656</Rcn><Nid>12212</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Hydrodynamic Synchronisation in Model and Biological Systems</Name><PI>Pietro Cicuta</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Cilia and flagella beating in synchronised patterns give rise to metachronal waves, beautiful examples of emergent behaviour in biology. These collective dynamical states are essential in life, transporting nutrients and clearing pathogens; they arise from the mechanical interaction of individual cilia mediated by the viscous fluid.
Severe pathologies are associated with cilia malfunction in humans. The current analysis of ciliated tissues in the clinic is focused purely on the frequency of beating: this is insufficient to discriminate between different pathologies. Much more information is present in the cilia dynamics video data that is recorded from patients; it is not being extracted because the correct theoretical framework for analysis is not in place.
We will develop our current work on actively driven colloidal systems to selectively test aspects of the biological scenarios, and start a new line of investigation in our lab, with cell culture experiments to validate these findings; we will understand the onset of collective dynamics (new physics), and how cilia waves are robust against fluctuations in cilia beat frequency, spatial arrangement and fluid rheology. New video analysis tools will be developed based on this full understanding of mechanical synchronisation, enabling the collective dynamics to be related back to the behaviour of individual cilia and to the physical properties of the fluid.
The team will be of two Post-docs, responsible for the two parts of the project: model and biological systems. A PhD student will contribute to the biological experiments, which present multiple lines of investigation, and will develop the video-analysis code to obtain the full degree of information from biological experiments.
The new analysis tool that results from this project will be deployed in the clinical setting through an established collaboration; enabling diagnosis of airway disorders represents a broad impact on physiology and clinical practice.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,261,572</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="I-SURF"><Rcn>185555</Rcn><Nid>12347</Nid><HI>Universitat Konstanz, Germany</HI><Name>Inorganic surfactants with multifunctional heads</Name><PI>Sebastian Polarz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Surfactants are molecules of enormous scientific and technological importance, which are widely used as detergents, emulsifiers or for the preparation of diverse nanostructures. Fascinating abilities regarding the formation of self-organized structures, like micelles or liquid crystals, originate from their amphiphilic architecture, which comprises a polar head group linked to a hydrophobic chain. While almost all known surfactants are organic, a new family of surfactants is now emerging, which combine amphiphilic properties with the advanced functionality of transition metal building blocks. The current project aims at the synthesis of unique inorganic surfactants (I-SURFs), which contain multinuclear, charged metal-oxo entities as heads, and their exploration with regard to additional redox, catalytic or magnetic functionalities. A particular challenge is the creation of smart surfactant systems that can be controlled via external stimuli. While thermotropic liquid crystals and their adjustment in electric fields (enabling LCDs) have been studied in depth, very limited research concerns the control of self-assembled amphiphilic structures by use of magnetic fields. It is obvious that exposure to a magnetic field has inherent advantages over electric fields for controlling structures in water. I-SURFs with single-molecule magnets as heads will be thus prepared and studied. Another groundbreaking task is the creation of I-SURFs with additional catalytic activities. Since catalytic heads can be positioned via self-organization, for instance on the surface of micellar aggregates, catalytic relay systems can be assembled with a second catalytic species in proximity to the first. Thus, cooperative effects in catalytic tandem reactions will ultimately be observed. These examples show that frontier research on I-SURFs is of outstanding relevance for supramolecular science and will certainly pave the way toward new technological applications with great benefits to society."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,863,546</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INTENSE"><Rcn>192414</Rcn><Nid>13453</Nid><HI>University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom</HI><Name>INTENSE: INTElligent use of climate models for adaptatioN to non-Stationary climate Extremes</Name><PI>Hayley Jane Fowler</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The research proposed here will use a novel and fully-integrated data-modelling approach to provide a step-change in our understanding of the nature and drivers of global precipitation extremes and change on societally relevant timescales. Extreme precipitation is increasing globally and theoretical considerations suggest this will continue with global warming, but opportunistic datasets indicate that sub-daily precipitation extremes will intensify more than is anticipated. Determining the precise response of precipitation extremes is hampered by coarse climate models which cannot adequately resolve cloud-scale processes and a lack of sub-daily observations. INTENSE will comprehensively analyse the response of precipitation extremes to global warming by constructing the first global sub-daily precipitation dataset, enabling substantial advances in observing current and past changes. Together with other new observational datasets and high-resolution climate modelling, this will quantify the nature and drivers of global precipitation extremes and their response to natural variability and forcing across multiple timescales. Specifically the project will examine the influence of local thermodynamics and large-scale circulation modes on observed precipitation extremes using new statistical methods which recognise the non-stationary nature of precipitation, and use these to identify climate model deficiencies in the representation of precipitation extremes. The recurrence of extreme hydrological events is notoriously hard to predict, yet successful climate adaptation will need reliable information which better quantifies projected changes. INTENSE will provide a new synergy between data, models and theory to tackle the problem using a process-based framework; isolating the precursors for extreme precipitation and intelligently using detailed modelling as a tool to understand how these extremes will respond to a warming world and the implications for adaptation strategy."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,986,801</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INTERFERE"><Rcn>185674</Rcn><Nid>10724</Nid><HI>Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium</HI><Name>Sparse Signal Coding for Interference-based Imaging Modalities</Name><PI>Peter Schelkens</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Since its invention in 1948 by Dennis Gabor holography has held the promise to empower full parallax 3D visualisation.

By providing the highest intermolecular interaction energies, ionic interactions have an extreme impact on molecular structures, which are the key to molecular functions. Experimentally determined structures of small contact ion pairs in solution are very rare and sometimes lacking in complete research fields. In addition, despite the amazing progress in theoretical and supramolecular chemistry, the subtle interplay of interactions in small organic ion pairs remains largely unknown. As a result design principles for small organic ion pairs in solution are not available. To solve this general problem there is an urgent and actual need of the synthetic community, because ion-pairing catalysis is the actual hot topic in asymmetric catalysis. There, new catalysts have to be screened with high effort in a black box mode and reviews state that structural and mechanistic studies will be an essential part of the further progress in the field. In previous projects spread over the fields of organometallic, bioorganic, supramolecular and medicinal chemistry as well as transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis, we gained special NMR expertise in the structure elucidation of ion pairs and reaction intermediates as well as the assessment of intermolecular interactions. Now in this project, nearly all of these various techniques and approaches will be combined in a new and so far unprecedented way and complemented by techniques used for protein ligand interactions and extreme low temperature measurements. With this unique combination, NMR approaches will be developed and applied to elucidate the structures of catalytically active ion pairs and their intermediates in solution and to dissect their intermolecular interactions.

We will use isotopic fractionations imparted by metal-silicate equilibration during core formation to obtain new and firm constraints on (i) the physical and chemical processes during formation of the Earth's core; and (ii) on the origin of volatile elements and the volatile accretion history of the Earth. The underlying concept of our  approach is to compare observed mantle-core isotopic fractionations (determined on natural samples) to the experimentally-determined isotope fractionation between liquid metal (core analogue) and liquid silicate (mantle analogue). Since the magnitude of isotope fractionation is strongly temperature-dependent, this comparison will enable us to evaluate core formation temperatures. I propose to use the stable isotope systematics of W, Mo and Cr to assess as to whether core formation temperatures for the Earth, Moon, Mars and asteroids are different, as would be expected if metal segregation in the Earth involved metal-silicate equilibration in a deep magma ocean. If instead all bodies have similar core formation temperatures, then formation of the Earth's core most probably involved some disequilibrium induced by direct core mergers during accretion from differentiated bodies. The second major theme of the proposed research uses Ge and Sb stable isotopes to trace the origins of Earth's volatiles. The combined investigation of Ge and Sb isotope fractionations in natural samples and metal-silicate equilibration experiments will enable us to determine as to whether Ge and Sb, and with them other volatile elements, show an isotope signature resulting from core formation. Identifying such a signature would provide the unequivocal evidence that volatile elements were delivered to the Earth during core formation and not subsequently, after the core had formed."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,940,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InanoMOF"><Rcn>185614</Rcn><Nid>12330</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut Catala De Nanociencia I Nanotecnologia, Spain</HI><Name>Multifunctional micro- and nanostructures assembled from nanoscale metal-organic frameworks and inorganic nanoparticles</Name><PI>Daniel Maspoch Comamala</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In InanoMOF, we aim to develop frontier Supramolecular and Nanochemistry methodologies for the synthesis of a novel class of structures via controlled assembly of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nanoMOFs) and inorganic nanoparticles (INPs). These methods will embody the premise that &#226;&#128;&#156;controlled object-by-object nano-assembly is a ground-breaking approach to explore for producing systems of higher complexity with advanced functions&#226;&#128;&#157;. The resulting hybrid nanoMOF@INPs will marry the unique properties of INPs (magnetism of iron oxide NPs and optics of Au NPs) to the functional porosity of MOFs.

The first part of InanoMOF encompasses the design, synthesis-assembly and characterisation of nanoMOF@INPs - advanced MOF-based sorbents that incorporate the functionality of the INPs used: magnetically controlled movement, in vivo detectability, enhanced biocompatibility and porosity, pollutant removal, or controlled sorption/delivery. The second part of InanoMOF entails studying the physicochemical properties of the synthesised nanoMOF@INPs and ascertaining their utility as drug-delivery/theranostic systems and as magnetic sorbents for pollutant removal. Specifically, we will study their stability in working media and determine their capacities for drug or pollutant sorption/delivery capacities. As proof-of-concept, we will study their toxicity in vitro and in vivo; enhancement of their in vitro therapeutic efficacy; and their capacity to remove pollutants (in real water and gasoline/diesel fuel samples) via magnetic assistance.

In InanoMOF we will endeavour to establish the synthetic bases for controlling the spatial ordering of nanoMOF crystals, whether alone or combined with other nanomaterials (e.g. INPs, graphene, etc.). We are confident that our work will ultimately enable researchers to create MOF-based composites having cooperative and synergistic properties and functions for myriad applications (e.g. heterogeneous catalysis, sensing and separation).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,942,665</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LBCAD"><Rcn>192410</Rcn><Nid>13452</Nid><HI>Univerzita Karlova V Praze, Czech Republic</HI><Name>Lower bounds for combinatorial algorithms and dynamic problems</Name><PI>Michal Koucky</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project aims to establish the time complexity of algorithms for two classes of problems. The first class consists of problems related to Boolean matrix multiplication and matrix multiplication over various semirings. This class contains problems such as computing transitive closure of a graph and determining the minimum distance between all-pairs of nodes in a graph. Known combinatorial algorithms for these problems run in slightly sub-cubic time. By combinatorial algorithms we mean algorithms that do not rely on the fast matrix multiplication over rings. Our goal is to show that the known combinatorial algorithms for these problems are essentially optimal. This requires designing a model of combinatorial algorithms and proving almost cubic lower bounds in it.

The other class of problems that we will focus on contains dynamic data structure problems such as dynamic graph reachability and related problems. Known algorithms for these problems exhibit trade-off between the query time and the update time, where at least one of them is always polynomial. Our goal is to show that indeed any algorithm for these problems must have update time or query time at least polynomial.

The two classes of problems are closely associated with so called 3SUM problem which serves as a benchmark for uncomputability in sub-quadratic time. Our goal is to deepen and extend the known connections between 3SUM, the other two classes and problems like formula satisfiability (SAT)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>900,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LifeInverse"><Rcn>185581</Rcn><Nid>12003</Nid><HI>Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster, Germany</HI><Name>Variational Methods for Dynamic Inverse Problems in the Life Sciences</Name><PI>Martin Burger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project will develop novel techniques for solving inverse problems in life sciences, in particular related to dynamic imaging. Major challenges in this area are efficient four- dimensional image reconstruction under low SNR conditions and further the quantification of image series as obtained from molecular imaging or life microscopy techniques. We will tackle both of them in a rather unified framework as inverse problems for time-dependent (systems of) partial differential equations.
In the solution of these inverse problems we will investigate novel approaches for the following aspects specific to the above-mentioned problems in the life sciences:

1. Solution of inverse problems for PDEs in complex time-varying geometries
2. Development of appropriate variational regularization models for dynamic images, including noise and motion models
3. Improved forward and inverse modelling of cellular and intracellular dynamics leading to novel inverse problems for nonlinear partial differential equations
4. Construction and implementation of efficient iterative solution methods for the arising 4D inverse problems and their variational formulation

All tasks will be driven by concrete applications in biology and medicine and their success will be evaluated in applications to real problems and data. This is based on interdisciplinary work related to electrocardiology and developmental biology.

At the same time, programming distributed systems is notoriously hard. Programmers have to deal with asynchrony and have to cater for partial failures -- the possibility that certain communication(s), processes, or hosts fail while others remain operational. These failures can have drastic consequences such as the missing to react to critical events or inconsistent states respectively. Limitations on existing hardware infrastructure necessitate subtle assumptions on system and failure models though to achieve efficient yet complex algorithmic solutions, whose implementation is prone to delicate defects.


Existing techniques for engineering reliable distributed systems software require much effort (e.g., program annotations in the form of invariants) thus discouraging many developers from their use; other techniques require developers to explicitly run specific tools (e.g., model checkers) which are thus easily left out and still can not achieve complete validation.

LiveSoft investigates static techniques to verify a subset of relevant and failure-prone aspects of distributed software --- interaction between components --- in a way which is lightweight and can be integrated with compilation. Our techniques will be able to sieve out many important defects upfront by pushing software reliability into the software design process. To that end LiveSoft proposes protocol types which leverage experiences with session types yet focus on fault-tolerant distributed systems by emphasizing asynchrony, failure handling and recovery, protocol composition, security, and parameterization. A main challenge is to support different system and failure models including emerging hardware trends such as hardware transactional memory and non-volatile memory rather than hardwiring speicific notions of (a)synchrony and failures.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,320</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MASSLIP"><Rcn>185677</Rcn><Nid>12030</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systems Medical Diagnostics by In-vivo Ambient Mass Spectrometric Profiling of Tissue Lipidome</Name><PI>Zoltan Takats</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The objective of the proposal is the development of ambient mass spectrometric methods for the characterisation of mucosal metabolome and lipidome. While recent advent of ambient MS provided new means for in-situ and imaging analyses and led to the development of real-time, in-vivo MS characterisation of tissues, there are no methods available for minimally invasive testing of mucosal surfaces including the associated microflora. Human mucosa-associated microbiome (with special emphasis on the gastrointestinal microbiota) has been recently demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of localised (cancer, chronic inflammatory disease) and systemic (hypertension, diabetes, obesity) conditions. While the microbiota interacts with the host mostly via production of a variety of metabolites, currently there is no method available for the in-situ metabolic profiling of mucosa. The envisioned methods will presumably fill this gap, by providing a technique for the diagnosis of a wide range of diseases ranging from acute infections through cancer to dysbiotic conditions of the microflora leading to chronic illnesses.
In the current proposal we put forward the development of different ambient ionisation setups utilising Jet Desorption Ionisation, Sonic Spray Ionisation and Rapid Evaporation Ionisation MS covering a broad range of invasiveness. We plan to combine the methods with standard endoscopic tools and develop the concept of &#194;&#180;chemically aware&#194;&#180; or intelligent endoscopic device capable of the unambiguous identification of pathological conditions of the mucosa. Since the metabolic profile-based identification approach requires large authentic datasets, we plan to create both histopathological and bacterial spectral databases with histological and 16SrRNA-based validation. The proposal also comprises the development of novel multivariate statistical analysis workflows and data fusion algorithms allowing rapid and accurate identification using multimodal MS datasets."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,663</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MHETSCALE"><Rcn>185662</Rcn><Nid>11236</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior Deinvestigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>Mixing in Heterogeneous Media Across Spatial and Temporal Scales: From Local Non-Equilibrium to Anomalous Chemical Transport and Dynamic Uncertainty</Name><PI>Marco Dentz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Transport, mixing and reaction of solutes and particles in natural media are of central importance in many fields of science and engineering, ranging from contaminant dispersion in geophysical flows to diffusion in living cells. Transport in these intrinsically heterogeneous media is characterized by early and late solute and particle arrivals, tailed spatial distributions, and scale effects in measured parameters. These behaviors cannot be explained by available models based on Fick&#226;&#128;&#153;s law and are called anomalous despite their ubiquity. The origin of such phenomena lies in heterogeneity-induced mixing processes that lead to fluctuations in chemical concentration, or, in other words, to physical non-equilibrium. Current transport formulations based on the advection-dispersion-reaction equation or phenomenological non-equilibrium models lack the relation to the heterogeneity controls, fail to describe mixing and concentration variability and thus are not suited for the quantification of chemical reactions. The main objective of this proposal is to establish a global predictive framework that quantifies mixing across scales, anomalous transport and reaction, and dynamic uncertainty for heterogeneous media. We propose an integrated approach that links the interrelated phenomena of mixing, anomalous transport and chemical reaction. In short, the idea consists in quantifying microscale heterogeneity-induced mixing in terms of the flow kinematics and heterogeneity structure and linking it to transport through its relation to Lagrangian particle dynamics. These dynamics will be quantified stochastically by a novel generalized continuous time random walk approach and used to model chemical reactions under physical non-equilibrium in order to obtain a new solid approach for simulating reactive and conservative transport through natural media.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,904,186</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MINERVA"><Rcn>185644</Rcn><Nid>12018</Nid><HI>Koc University, Turkey</HI><Name>Communication Theoretical Foundations of Nervous System Towards BIO-inspired Nanonetworks and ICT-inspired Neuro-treatment</Name><PI>Ozgur B.

Emerging nanoscale applications mandate enabling nanomachines to communicate and form nanonetworks to overcome the limitations of a single one. Thus, our aim is to find the answer to the profound question, i.e., &#226;&#128;&#156;is the room down there sufficient for a communication network?&#226;&#128;&#157; Thanks to natural evolution, the affirmative answer is right inside us. Human body is a large- scale communication network of molecular nanonetworks composed of billions of nanomachines, i.e., cells, which use molecules to encode, transmit and receive information. Any communication failure that is beyond the recovery capabilities of this network leads to diseases. In this project, first, (1) we will investigate the communication theoretical foundations of nanoscale neuro-spike communication channels between neurons. Second, (2) we will study multi-terminal, i.e., multiple-access, relay, broadcast, neuro-spike channels and nervous nanonetwork in terms of communication theoretical metrics. Third, (3) we will validate our channel and nanonetwork models with physiological data, and develop a nervous nanonetwork simulator (N4Sim). Finally, (4) we will develop the first nanoscale bio-inspired communication system for ICT-inspired neuro-treatment for spinal cord injury, i.e., nanoscale artificial synapse, which will mimic neuron behaviour by realising both electrical and nanoscale molecular communications.The MINERVA project will pave the way for the realisation of emerging nanonetwork applications with significant societal impact, e.g., intra-body networks for health monitoring, drug delivery, chemical and biological attack prevention systems.

Recent work has revealed exciting physics at their interfaces, including two-dimensional (2D) conductivity and superconductivity in the electron gas that forms at the interface between two band insulators, LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. However, to date, no interfacial system has truly shown electronic properties that are absent from the phase diagram of both bulk constituents. I argue that to fully embrace the immense potential of oxide interfaces and unveil unprecedented electronic phases, combining insulators with stronger electronic correlations is mandatory.

At the crossroad between strongly-correlated electron physics, microelectronics and spintronics, the MINT project will pioneer routes toward a new realm of solid-state physics. MINT will harness electronic and magnetic instabilities in correlated oxides to craft new electronic phases controllable by external stimuli. These phases will be generated by the synergic action of strain engineering, interfacial charge/orbital/spin reconstruction and octahedra connectivity control, using rare-earth titanate RTiO3 Mott-Hubbard insulators as templates.

Emerging states that are foreseen include 2D electron gases with ferroic order, superconductivity at relatively high temperature, topological states and new forms of multiferroicity and magnetoelectric coupling. The discovery of any of these new states would represent a major breakthrough in oxide electronics. They will open possibilities for innovative devices yielding giant electroresistance without ferroelectrics, and new schemes to control spin currents by electric fields.

At full term, MINT will establish whether oxide interfaces will live up to their expectations and start in the coming decades a technological revolution comparable to that of silicon."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,026</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOTMELSUM"><Rcn>185607</Rcn><Nid>11993</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Motivic Mellin transforms and exponential sums through non-archimedean geometry</Name><PI>Raf Cluckers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"We aim to create a new and powerful theory of motivic integration which incorporates Mellin transforms. The absence of motivic Mellin transforms is a major drawback of the existing theories. Classical Mellin transforms are in essence Fourier transforms on the multiplicative group of local fields. We aim to apply this theory to study new motivic Poisson summation formulas, new transfer principles, and applications of these. All of this has so far only been studied in the presence of additive characters, and remains completely open for multiplicative characters. Understanding all this at a motivic level yields a uniform understanding when the local field varies and will require an approach using non-archimedean geometry. We will open up possibilities for applications via new transfer principles and will give access to motivic Poisson formulas of other groups than the additive group. For these applications it is important that Fubini Theorems are present at the level of the motivic integrals, which we aim to develop. We will overcome the major obstacle of the totally different nature of the dual group of the multiplicative group by a proposed sequence of germs of ideas by the author. The importance of our work on motivic Fourier transforms on the additive group is already widely recognized, and this proposal will complement it by exploring the new territory of motivic multiplicative characters. A final topic is the study of the highly non-understood exponential sums modulo powers of primes, in relation with Igusa's foundational work. We will try to discover a deeper understanding of the uniform behavior of these sums when the prime number varies. These sums are linked to geometrical concepts like the log-canonical threshold, and also to Poisson summation, after the work by Igusa. We will aim to prove a highly generalized form of Igusa's conjecture on exponential sums."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>912,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MSMath"><Rcn>188649</Rcn><Nid>12204</Nid><HI>Ecole Nationale Des Ponts Et Chaussees, France</HI><Name>Molecular Simulation: modeling, algorithms and mathematical analysis</Name><PI>Tony Gilbert Lelievre</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Many models for materials rely on a microscopic description. In a classical regime and for a fixed temperature, atoms are described by particles that interact through a force field and evolve according to Newton&#226;&#128;&#153;s equations of motion, with additional stochastic terms to model thermostating. This simulation technique is called molecular dynamics. Applications are ubiquitous, ranging from biology to materials science.

The direct numerical simulation of these models is extremely computationally expensive, since the typical timescale at the microscopic level is orders of magnitude smaller than the macroscopic timescales of interest. Many algorithms used by practitioners have not yet been investigated by applied mathematicians. The aim of this proposal is to further develop the mathematical analysis of these methods and to build new and more efficient algorithms, validated by precise error estimates.

The underlying theoretical questions are related to the mathematical definition and quantification of metastability for stochastic processes. Metastability refers to the fact that the stochastic process remains trapped in some regions of the configuration space for very long times. Using naive simulations, transitions between these states are very rarely observed, whereas these transition events are actually those which matter at the macroscopic level. Metastability is one of the major bottlenecks in making molecular simulations predictive for real life test cases.

The main challenges motivating this proposal are: the design of efficient techniques to sample high-dimensional multimodal measures, the development and analysis of algorithms to sample metastable dynamics and the construction of coarse-graining techniques for high-dimensional problems.

This project relies on strong collaborations with practitioners (biologists and physicists) in order to propose common benchmarks, to identify the methodological bottlenecks and to apply new algorithms to real life test cases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,773,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MULTISCOPE"><Rcn>185556</Rcn><Nid>11381</Nid><HI>Julius-Maximilians Universitaet Wuerzburg, Germany</HI><Name>Multidimensional Ultrafast Time-Interferometric Spectroscopy of Coherent Phenomena in all Environments</Name><PI>Tobias Manuel Brixner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"We propose to develop and apply novel methods of nonlinear spectroscopy to investigate the significance and consequences of coherent effects for a variety of photophysical and photochemical molecular processes. We will use coherent two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy as an ideal tool to study electronic coherences.

Quantum mechanics as described by the Schr&#195;&#182;dinger equation is fully coherent: The phase of a wavefunction evolves deterministically in the time-dependent case. However, observations are restricted to reduced &#226;&#128;&#156;systems&#226;&#128;&#157; coupled to an &#226;&#128;&#156;environment.&#226;&#128;&#157; The resulting transition from coherent to incoherent behavior on an ultrafast timescale has many yet unexplored consequences, e.g. for transport in photosynthesis, photovoltaics or other molecular &#226;&#128;&#156;nanomaterials.&#226;&#128;&#157;

In contrast to conventional 2D spectroscopy, we will not measure the coherently emitted field within a four-wave mixing process but rather implement a range of incoherent observables (ion mass spectra, fluorescence, and photoelectrons). Yet we can still extract all the desired information using &#226;&#128;&#156;phase cycling&#226;&#128;&#157; with collinear pulse sequences from a femtosecond pulse shaper. This opens up a new range of interdisciplinary experiments and will allow for the first time a direct nonlinear-spectroscopic comparison of molecular systems in all states of matter. Specifically, we will realize 2D spectroscopy in molecular beams, liquids, low-temperature solids, and on surfaces including heterogeneous and nanostructured samples. Tuning the external couplings will help elucidating the role of the environment in electronic (de)coherence phenomena.

Furthermore, we will combine 2D spectroscopy with subdiffraction spatial resolution using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). This enables us to map transport in molecular aggregates and other heterogeneous nanosystems in time and space on a nanometer length scale.

Despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts, the mechanisms of the gas-to-particle conversion are still poorly understood, and so are the parameterizations of this process in climate models. Improving the situation critically depends on the continuous development of experimental techniques. For the quantitative characterization of nanoparticle dynamics especially time resolution deserves more attention. I am thus proposing to design instruments that will improve time resolution by up to five orders of magnitude. Specifically, I am planning the design of a fast-scanning electrical mobility based nanoparticle spectrometer delivering size distributions from 1 nm upwards at 1 Hz, for number concentrations as low as 100 cm-3. Secondly, in a new approach to the study of secondary organic aerosol formation I am planning to apply small angle x-ray scattering providing direct information on particle size and number at sub-millisecond time-resolution.

Current methods for pain management (e.g. local injection of pain killers) are inadequate because of the short duration of action. Even sustained release treatments, such as drug-loaded liposomes, provide only one week of analgesia producing a continuous extended nerve blockade without allowing for changes in daily physical activity or level of pain relief. More importantly, such systems cannot be turned off until they run their course.

In this proposal, a locally-injected or implanted near infrared (NIR)-sensitive drug reservoir that can be triggered by a simple handheld laser device applied externally is described. The device enables drug release with consistent response over multiple on/off cycles. Such a device, implanted (or eventually injected) on a nerve or near the neuraxis, could have substantial clinical impact in the treatment of chronic (or prolonged perioperative) pain.

This system will consist of an impermeable ethylcellulose membrane embedded with temperature-sensitive polymer nanoparticles and NIR-active gold nanoparticles. The membrane will be engineered such that the nanoparticles form a disordered but interconnected network throughout. The gold nanoparticle concentration will be adjusted so that light-induced heating of the nanoparticles produces sufficient heat to collapse the polymer, thus opening the porous network. Those nanostructured materials which compose the device will be produced in a continuous manner by using microfluidic reactors to avoid the characteristic disadvantages when using conventional discontinuous (batch) reactors. Nanoparticle-synthesis protocols will be supported by computational fluid dynamics.

The second type represents the meeting point of many of the great challenges of statistical physics and materials science. What is the mechanism of dynamical arrest, by which structural relaxation become progressively inhibited upon cooling from a liquid to a glass? Can we develop physical pictures of the sequence of fluctuations associated with irreversible relaxation in metastable liquids? How do crystals emerge from these fluctuations?

Here we take a structural approach coupled with novel experiments and computer simulations to tackle two specific questions. Firstly, it has long been believed that there should be some structural mechanism underpinning the glass transition, where deeply supercooled liquids continuously transform into solid glasses. Secondly, the fate of the supercooled liquid &#226;&#128;&#147; whether it crystallises on accessible timescales &#226;&#128;&#147; should also be related to the local atomic arrangements in the liquid. Tackling the first will lead to insight into the nature of the glass transition - it is not known whether or not there is a true thermodynamic transition to a glass. As for crystallisation, predicted nucleation rates vary wildly with those obtained experimentally in the only system in which both have been compared, little is known beyond trial and error of means by which crystallisation in mixtures can be controlled. In short, our understanding of the fate of supercooled liquids is lacking in a variety of ways. Understanding the glass transition and nucleation is of fundamental importance, and both have important applications for example in metallic glasses and phase change materials. The former are prized for their superior mechanical properties such as extreme toughness while latter underpin emergent technologies such as optical data storage and phase change memory."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,336,887</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NAUTILUS"><Rcn>185576</Rcn><Nid>12337</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Neutron cAptUres consTraIning steLlar nUcleosynthesiS</Name><PI>Rene Reifarth</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"NAUTILUS will investigate the nucleosynthesis of the chemical elements during the evolution of stars, which is the basis for understanding the chemical history of the Universe. The vast majority of the elements heavier than iron are produced by neutron capture reactions. The precise knowledge of the involved neutron capture cross sections for certain isotopes sets tight limits for stellar parameters and puts strong constraints on the age of the Universe.

Accurate measurements of the key nuclear reactions in the mass region around the radioactive 85Kr will lead to the improvements needed to characterize the production processes of the elements in stars. The respective high-accuracy abundance patterns in single stars can then be interpreted as diagnostic tools for the deep stellar interior and the isobaric 87Sr/87Rb chronometer constraints the history of the Universe.

The neutron capture cross section of radioactive isotopes for neutron energies in the keV region will be measured by a time-of-flight (TOF) experiment. NAUTILUS will provide a unique facility realizing the TOF technique with an ultra-short flight path at the FRANZ setup at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Germany. A highly optimized spherical photon calorimeter will be built and installed at an ultra-short flight path.

NAUTILUS opens new horizons in the area of neutron-induced reaction research, as smallest samples like of 85Kr - which will be produced as an isotopically pure radioactive sample - will become measureable in reasonable times.

Future applications include the study of neutron capture cross sections important for next generation nuclear reactors: For the first time the high neutron fluxes needed to study the mass region of interest in the keV energy range will be available."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,871,596</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NLL"><Rcn>185665</Rcn><Nid>11372</Nid><HI>Bilkent &#195;&#156;niversitesi, Turkey</HI><Name>Nonlinear Laser Lithography</Name><PI>Fatih &#195;&#182;mer &#196;&#176;lday</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Control of matter via light has always fascinated humankind; not surprisingly, laser patterning of materials is as old as the history of the laser. However, this approach has suffered to date from a stubborn lack of long-range order. We have recently discovered a method for regulating self-organised formation of metal-oxide nanostructures at high speed via non-local feedback, thereby achieving unprecedented levels of uniformity over indefinitely large areas by simply scanning the laser beam over the surface.

Here, we propose to develop hitherto unimaginable levels of control over matter through laser light. The total optical field at any point is determined by the incident laser field and scattered light from the surrounding surface, in a mathematical form similar to that of a hologram. Thus, it is only logical to control the self-organised pattern through the laser field using, e.g., a spatial light modulator. A simple wavefront tilt should change the periodicity of the nanostructures, but much more exciting possibilities include creation of patterns without translational symmetry, i.e., quasicrystals, or patterns evolving non-trivially under scanning, akin to cellular automata. Our initial results were obtained in ambient atmosphere, where oxygen is the dominant reactant, forming oxides. We further propose to control the chemistry by using a plasma jet to sputter a chosen reactive species onto the surface, which is activated by the laser. While we will focus on the basic mechanisms with atomic nitrogen as test reactant to generate compounds such as TiN and SiN, in principle, this approach paves the way to synthesis of an endless list of materials.

By bringing these ideas together, the foundations of revolutionary advances, straddling the boundaries of science fiction, can be laid: laser-controlled self-assembly of plethora of 2D patterns, crystals, and quasicrystals alike, eventually assembled layer by layer into the third dimension -- a 3D material synthesiser."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,920</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NMST"><Rcn>188673</Rcn><Nid>11263</Nid><HI>Bcam - Basque Center For Applied Mathematics Asociacion, Spain</HI><Name>New methods and interacions in Singularity Theory and beyond</Name><PI>Javier Jose Fernandez De Bobadilla De Olazabal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project is centred in Singularity Theory and its interactions and applications to Complex and Algebraic Geometry, Differential/symplectic/Contact Topology, Hodge Theory and Algebraic Topology.

The advancement of earthquake risk assessment and forecasting methods (probability estimates that a mainshock may occur in terms of hypocentre location, magnitude and time) calls for a sound physical basis. The nucleation, propagation and arrest of an earthquake rupture results from the interplay of stress perturbations, micro- to macro-scale friction- and rupture-related processes and fault zone geometrical complexity. Most of the information about these parameters is out of reach of seismic waves and geophysical analysis. Here we aim at enhancing our knowledge of earthquake physics (from nucleation to arrest) by means of a multidisciplinary approach that includes:

1) experiments to investigate earthquake nucleation by reproducing crustal (pressure, temperature, presence of fluids, stress perturbations, etc.) deformation conditions with the most powerful earthquake simulator installed worldwide (SHIVA);

2) experiments to investigate rupture propagation on simulated faults using natural rocks and small-scale analogue models;

3) field studies of exhumed seismogenic sources to quantify the geometrical complexity of natural fault zones;

4) advanced numerical simulation techniques that will integrate the above information and allow up-scaling to natural faults. The numerical models will produce physically-based earthquake simulations that will be compared with high-resolution seismic data.

By reproducing crustal deformation conditions (stress, temperature, fluid pressures, etc.) in the laboratory and by monitoring acoustic emissions, gases, electromagnetic waves, etc., produced by the rock samples during deformation, a by-product of our research will be the systematic investigation of precursory phenomena (seismic, chemical, and electromagnetic) associated to earthquake nucleation processes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,963,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NONSPHEREFLOW"><Rcn>185574</Rcn><Nid>12008</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands</HI><Name>Multiscale modelling of gas-fluidized flows of non-spherical particles</Name><PI>Johannes Tiemen Padding</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Many important products are made using fluidized bed reactors, where solid particles are suspended by a gas flow. This promotes highly efficient gas-particle contact, resulting in high heat transfer, high chemical reaction rates and high product yields. Multiscale modelling has proven to be indispensable in the design and optimisation of fluidized bed reactors. Most coarse-grained models assume that the solid particles are of spherical shape because this simplifies the treatment of gas-solid drag and particle collisions. However, many particles used in fluidized bed (bio)reactors are non-spherical. This means that anisotropic collisions, anisotropic gas-solid drag, effects of local particle alignment, and alignment by nearby internal and external walls all need to be taken into account.
I propose to pioneer a multiscale simulation methodology, backed up by validating in-house experiments, for prediction of structure formation in gas-solid flows of inelastic non-spherical particles. As a first step we focus on elongated particles. The multiscale approach consists of: 1) fully resolved simulations to obtain closures for translational and rotational gas drag tensors in crowded environments and near external and internal walls, 2) Discrete Particle Model simulations to validate the drag closures with matching experiments and to obtain statistics of angular and linear velocity changes due to inter-particle collisions between groups of particles, 3) a novel Lagrangian method based on stochastic multi-particle collisions. The collision propagation rules make maximum use of conservation laws and local symmetries of the particle configuration, orientation and deformation rates. The coarse-grained model is amenable to a parcel approach and can be coupled with heat and mass transfer models, allowing for simulation of industrial scale reactors with non-spherical particles.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,983,012</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NSHOCK"><Rcn>185669</Rcn><Nid>10727</Nid><HI>Politecnico Di Milano, Italy</HI><Name>Non classical rarefaction shock-waves in molecularly complex vapours</Name><PI>Alberto Guardone</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The expansion of a dilute gas through a gasdynamics convergent-divergent nozzle can occur in three different regimes, depending on the inlet and discharge conditions and on the gas: via a fully subsonic expansion, via a subsonic-supersonic or via a subsonic-supersonic-subsonic expansion embedding a compression shock wave within the divergent portion of the nozzle. I devised an exact solution procedure for computing nozzle flows of real gases, which allowed me to discover that in molecularly complex fluids eighteen additional different flow configurations are possible, each including multiple compression classical shocks as well as non classical rarefaction ones. Modern thermodynamic models indicate that these exotic regimes can possibly occur in nozzle flows of molecularly complex fluids such as hydrocarbons, siloxanes or perfluorocarbons operating close to the liquid-vapour saturation curve and critical point. The experimental observation of one only of these eighteen flow configurations would be sufficient to prove for the first time that non classical gasdynamics phenomena are indeed possible in the vapour region of a fluid with high molecular complexity
To this purpose, a modification to the blow-down wind tunnel for dense gases at Politecnico di Milano is proposed to use mixtures of siloxane fluids. Measurements are complemented by numerical simulations of the expected flow field and by state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification techniques. The distinctive feature of the proposed experiment is the adoption of mixture of siloxanes as working fluids. Mixtures of siloxanes are well known to exhibit an higher stability limit than their pure components, due to the redistribution process occurring at high temperature.
The increased understanding of real-gas dynamics will enable to improve the design of Organic Rankine Cycle Engines, to be used in  small scale energy production from biomasses, binary geothermal systems and concentrating solar thermal power plants.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,485,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoQuaNt"><Rcn>189836</Rcn><Nid>11814</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Nanofiber Quantum Networks</Name><PI>Arno Rauschenbeutel</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>We propose to establish nanofiber-based atom-light interfaces as quantum-enabled fiber-optical components for quantum information processing and communication (QIPC). The key ingredient of this interface is a nanofiber-based optical dipole trap which stores laser-cooled atoms in the evanescent field surrounding the nanofiber. In this evanescently coupled atom-waveguide-system, even a few hundred atoms are already optically dense for near-resonant photons propagating through the nanofiber. In combination with the proven good coherence properties of nanofiber-trapped atoms, these highly efficient light-matter interfaces are thus perfectly suited for the implementation of practical QIPC devices. More specifically, the first goal of this project is to realize quantum memories which allow one to directly store and retrieve the quantum state of fiber-guided photons. The efficiency of the retrieval process will highly benefit from the fact that conservation of energy and momentum stabilizes the emission of the stored light into the nanofiber-guided mode. Furthermore, nanofiber-coupled atomic ensembles can provide a strong optical non-linearity which, due to the waveguide-geometry, scales with the square root of the length of the sample and can be much larger than for freely propagating light beams. The second goal of this project is to explore and to maximize this non-linearity until it prevails down to the single photon level. This single-photon non-linearity would enable optical quantum switches and photon-photon quantum gates which are essential for implementing deterministic optical quantum computation. The final goal is then to interconnect these components in order to demonstrate three different fiber-optical quantum network applications: highly efficient photon counting using fiber-coupled quantum memories, highly efficient heralded entanglement of two fiber-coupled quantum memories, and a non-linear interaction between two single-photon pulses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,993,526</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoSpin"><Rcn>111549</Rcn><Nid>10071</Nid><HI>Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Nanoscale spin interactions and dynamics on superconducting surfaces</Name><PI>Katharina Jennifer Franke</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The latest concepts for quantum computing and data storage envision the use of single spins, which can be addressed and manipulated reliably. One of the main limitations towards this challenging goal is the ultra-short lifetime of excited spin states due to the interaction with the contacting leads. Another limitation is that coherence between individual spins is quickly lost. Already the measurement process for resolving coherent electron-spin interactions at the single atom level is highly challenging and has not been achieved so far.
Within our proposal, we will construct a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope with a radio-frequency current detection system and a microwave source close to the tip. With this unique machine, we will be able to carry out state-of-the-art STM experiments combined with atomic-scale precision of measuring electron-spin resonance signals. With the approach of measuring in the frequency domain, we increase our energy resolution beyond the thermal energy level broadening into the &#194;&#181;eV range and can thus investigate magnetic coupling, hyperfine interactions and spin coherence properties, which are not accessible in conventional STM experiments. We will also be able to probe the timescales of spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxations by pump-probe excitation schemes.
We will use this machine for resolving magnetic properties of single atoms and atomic-size nanostructures on superconducting substrates. These substrates exhibit two peculiarities, which are of crucial importance for quantum information processing. The spin lifetimes are orders of magnitudes larger than on normal metal surfaces. Furthermore, the long coherence length of Cooper pairs mediates coherent coupling of the spin states of paramagnetic atoms. We will manipulate the spin states by the intrinsic Josephson current as well as with external microwave radiation. Our model systems on superconductors will provide crucial steps towards quantum spin processing.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,469</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoSurfs"><Rcn>111426</Rcn><Nid>10094</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Nanostructured Surfaces: Molecular Functionality on advanced sp2-bonded substrates</Name><PI>Wilhelm Auw&#195;&#164;rter</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Inspired by the diverse functionalities of complex molecular building blocks evidenced in manifold life processes as transport of respiratory gases, metabolism or light harvesting, we aim for a comprehensive characterization and control of molecular properties in surface-based model systems. To fully exploit and tune molecular functionality on substrates, a paradigm shift away from conventional metal supports, which might drastically affect adsorbates, is mandatory. We propose to apply nanostructured boron nitride (BN) monolayers and sp2-heterostructures as templates for molecular units and architectures. As indicated by the fascinating nanomesh interface and the electronically corrugated atomically thin BN sheet on Cu we recently reported, inert, temperature stable and insulating BN has a huge potential as advanced substrate supporting molecular functionality, self-ordering and intercalation.
By combining the inherent functionality of organic or bio-molecular building blocks with the unusual electronic and structural characteristics of  advanced sp2-bonded substrates grown by chemical vapour deposition, we aim to achieve desired properties, including electronic, magnetic and conformational switching, tunable reactivity, or tailored electronic band gaps.

Firstly I aim to transform the way that we can currently detect disease through innovations in the design and development of nanomaterials-based biosensors that could be used to detect a number of diseases with global implications, such as cancer, malaria, heart failure and tuberculosis. These innovations in biosensor design will involve both building on our existing highly successful work on plasmonic biosensors and also involve the design and development of completely new polymersome and fluorescent based biosensors.

Until today, these extremely fast processes are little understood let alone utilized. With NearFieldAtto, strong-field driven phenomena at nanoscale metal structures will be explored to elucidate collective electron dynamics and to induce optical-field-driven currents -- on attosecond timescales. We will investigate the near-field of a nanotip, resulting from the collective dynamics, both in amplitude and phase. Conversely, we will use the tip as a nanometric sensor to map out the electric field inside the focus of a pulsed laser beam and will directly measure the local phase. In two-tip and molecular junctions, we will explore the ultrafast steering of electronic currents by optical fields, both over a nanometric gap and inside a molecule, taking advantage of the large near-field enhancement the systems offer.

My group has recently shown that attosecond physics phenomena can be observed at solids, namely at nanoscale tips [Kr&#195;&#188;ger et al., Nature 2011]. Hence, in NearFieldAtto we will employ techniques well known from attosecond physics with isolated objects, like gas-phase atoms and molecules, to steer laser-emitted electrons with the electric field of few-cycle laser pulses. We will use these electrons as nanometric probes to investigate optical properties of the solid state system and compare the results with those of isolated objects in gas-phase measurements. With two tips facing each other, we will realize a nanometric junction over which we will steer electrons with the optical field. A molecule placed between two tips will enable the investigation of a novel, ultrafast switching mechanism.

NearFieldAtto will bring attosecond physics a leap forward as compared to the state-of-the-art, will introduce strong-field physics into (quantum-)plasmonics, and will open the door towards lightwave or petahertz nano-electronics in metallic and molecular nano-systems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,012,733</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Neuro-Plasmonics"><Rcn>111602</Rcn><Nid>10054</Nid><HI>Fondazione Istituto Italiano Di Tecnologia, Italy</HI><Name>Neuro-Plasmonics</Name><PI>Francesco De Angelis</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Research neuronal signaling is the subject of a very large community, but progresses face a dense multi-scale dynamics involving signaling at the molecular, cellular and large neuronal network levels. Whereas the brain capabilities are most likely emerging from large neuronal networks, available electrophysiological methods limit our access to single cells and typically provides only a fragmented observation, on limited spatial/temporal scales. Therefore, broadening the spectrum of scales for observing neuronal signaling within large neuronal networks is a major challenge that can revolutionize our capability of studying the brain and its physio-pathological functions, as well as of deriving bio-inspired concepts to implement artificial system based on neuronal circuits. We propose the development of an innovative electro-plasmonic multifunctional platform that by combining different methodologies emerging from distant fields of Science and Technology will provide a radically new path for real time neurointerfacing at different scale levels:
1. The molecular scale: 3D plasmonic nanoantennas will give access to information at molecular level by means of enhanced spectroscopies with particular regard of time resolved Raman scattering.
2. The single-neuron scale within neuronal networks: by both in-cell and extra-cell couplings with 3D nanostructures which work at the same time as plasmonic antennas and CMOS 3D nanoelectrodes.

Recently, thanks to the progress in genomics and metagenomics, it has appeared that the biosynthetic potential of microorganisms and the complexity of the reactions catalyzed have been largely underestimated. Notably, enzymes using radical-based chemistry have been shown to be present in a very-large amount of biosynthetic pathways and to be widely distributed among all living organisms. The highly reactive radical species they generate give access to chemistries not accessible otherwise and allow them to catalyze unique and diverse reactions. Among them, the so-called ""radical SAM enzymes"" have attracted considerable attention in recent years. While, initially hypothesized to be a family with several hundreds of members, recent genomic analyses have revealed that there are several tens of thousands of radical SAM enzymes catalyzing more than sixty distinct biochemical processes.

Very recently, an ever increasing number of radical SAM enzymes has been discovered in the biosynthetic pathways of natural compounds. In several cases, it has been shown that, instead of involving non-ribosomal or polyketide synthases, microorganisms use radical SAM enzymes to extensively modify ribosomally synthesized peptides producing highly complex bioactive molecules. In the present project, we propose to develop a multidisciplinary approach to investigate promising radical SAM enzymes catalyzing peptide modifications and elucidate their unique mechanisms which, in many cases, have no counterparts in biochemistry and synthetic chemistry. Based on the unique and highly conserved radical SAM domain and the mechanistic insights gained, we will develop novel radical SAM enzymes as catalysts for the synthesis of new chemicals with original structures and properties using a synthetic biology approach."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,984,218</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NuMass"><Rcn>111579</Rcn><Nid>11822</Nid><HI>University Of Durham, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Neutrinos: a different portal to new physics Beyond the Standard Model</Name><PI>Silvia Pascoli</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In the past fifteen years, neutrino physics has revolutionised our understanding of particle physics. The discovery of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos have masses and mix: this is the only particle physics evidence of new physics beyond the Standard Model to date. Their origin remains a major challenge.

The NuMass project will focus on new physics at low energy scales, below the one reachable at the LHC. This approach is opposite to widely studied Standard Model extensions, which invoke new physics at scales so high that they will never be tested directly, and orthogonal to TeV models accessible at the LHC. The NuMass idea is that new particles in Nature could be hidden away not because they are too heavy but because, although light, they interact too weakly with ordinary matter. Neutrinos are by far the least understood of the standard fermions: if new particles are indeed at low scales, below the electroweak one, a likely scenario is that they couple more strongly to neutrinos than to other standard particles, e.g. quarks. Therefore, neutrinos are a unique portal into low energy physics.

The NuMass project will adopt a unique approach combining particle theory, phenomenology and cosmology. It will propose low energy extensions of the Standard Model and embed them in a consistent theory. It will study their signatures in experiments and their impact in the Early Universe. It will exploit the wide experimental programme, e.g. T2K, MicroBooNE, NOvA, GERDA, which will provide new data in the near future, to constrain the properties of the models.

The NuMass ultimate goal is to unveil a new theory of particles and interactions at low energy: its success would be groundbreaking as it would open a completely new perspective on the fundamental laws of Nature. New theoretical challenges would arise to explain why the new sector is light, and new experimental ones to test the new particles and interactions, leading to new directions in particle physics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,702,663</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="O2SENSE"><Rcn>189838</Rcn><Nid>10801</Nid><HI>University Of Bath, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Oxygen Sensing with Multimodality Imaging Probes</Name><PI>Sofia Ioana Pascu</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This programme will employ physical sciences and biomedicine techniques to develop a revolutionary approach to early cancer diagnosis and post-treatment monitoring aiming to address shortcomings in our current technology in oxygen sensing and imaging of hypoxic prostate tumours.

This proposal represents a gearing process towards the biomedical implementation of metal complexes and functionalised nanoparticles as novel synthetic platform systems for personalised diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancer and which can also be extended to neurodegenerative disorders. The work programme is a meeting point for interdisciplinary science that goes well beyond  state of the art. New chemical sensing devices will outstrip and supersede existing biopsy and imaging techniques used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancers.

The key advances of this programme will be:

(a) &#226;&#128;&#152;smart&#226;&#128;&#153; all-in-one multimodal imaging probes, whose sensitivities to levels of oxygen in cells (pO2) will be tunable to respond to various levels of hypoxia in tumors as desired. Our ultra-sensitive probes will be effective at low O2 concentrations and respond to reduced levels of hypoxia and under anoxia. This will surpass the mainstay in cancer diagnosis and therapy and provide increased selectivity for a wider range of tumours.

(b) new probes suitable for interlocked Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT), and optical imaging methodologies  Simultaneous in vitro and in vivo diagnostic information from radioimaging techniques (PET, SPECT) and optical imaging will provide in depth understanding of biological processes and lead to personalised medicine.

(c) new imaging tools for the first time will monitor the cellular biolocalisation of these probes by multiphoton optical imaging in nearIR regimes. These will drive the development of time-gated microscopy and multi-photon imaging with sensitivity for various levels of tumour hypoxia."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,886,876</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OutflowMagn"><Rcn>111406</Rcn><Nid>10097</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Magnetic fields and the outflows during the formation and evolution of stars</Name><PI>Wouter Henricus Theodorus Vlemmings</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The outflows of young and old stars play a crucial role in the cycle of matter in galaxies.  Stars and planetary systems are formed through complex physical processes during the collapse of gas clouds with outflows a required ingredient. At the end of a stars life, stellar outflows are the main source of heavy elements that are essential for the formation of stars, planets and life. Magnetic fields are one of the key factors governing the in particular the often observed collimated outflow. They might also be a key ingredient in driving stellar mass loss and are potentially essential for stabilizing accretion disks of, in particular, massive proto-stars. Only polarization observations at different spatial scales are able to measure the strength and structure of magnetic fields during the launching of outflows from young and old stars. Because stars in these evolutionary phases are highly obscured by dusty envelopes, their magnetic fields are best probed through observations of molecules and dust at submillimeter and radio wavelengths. In addition to its role, the origin of the magnetic field in these stellar phases is also still unknown and to determine it multi-wavelength observations are essential. The proposed research group will use state of the art submillimeter and radio instruments, integrated with self-consistent radiative transfer and magneto-hydrodynamic models, to examine the role and origin of magnetic fields during star formation and in the outflows from evolved stars. The group will search for planets around evolved stars to answer the elusive question on the origin of their magnetic field and determine the connection between the galactic magnetic field and that responsible for the formation of jets and potentially disks around young proto-stars. This fundamental new work, for which a dedicated research group is essential, will reveal the importance of magnetism during star formation as well as in driving and shaping the mass loss of evolved stars.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PALEOGENIE"><Rcn>111603</Rcn><Nid>10055</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>PAst Links in the Evolution of Ocean&#226;&#128;&#153;s Global ENvIronment and Ecology</Name><PI>Andrew John Ridgwell</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Species do not live in isolation, but adapt and ultimately, evolve, in relationship with other species as well as with their chemical and physical environment. In the marine environment, this interaction is intimately two-way &#226;&#128;&#147; the surface biogeochemical environment modulates the makeup of the pelagic ecosystem, yet at the same time, the ecosystem assemblage, by setting the strength of the biological pump and ultimately, in regulating the carbon and nutrient inventory of the ocean and atmospheric pCO2, influences the surface geochemical environment. Feedbacks, both negative and positive, must therefore exist between plankton ecology and global biogeochemical cycles. This has implications for understanding the geological record and particularly the response and recovery of marine ecosystems following major environmental perturbation, but also complicates making projections of future ocean changes.
The proposed project &#226;&#128;&#147; PALEOGENiE &#226;&#128;&#147; will directly address these challenges via the development of a unique coupled model of past plankton ecology and global biogeochemical cycles. The geological record of planktic ecosystems &#226;&#128;&#147; nannofossils &#226;&#128;&#147; will be collated and analyzed across a spectrum of geological events for which evidence of major changes in climate and massive carbon release together with the response of planktic ecosystems are recorded: the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, the end Cretaceous, and Ocean Anoxic Event 2. Both model and data will then be brought together in a unique attempt to better understanding the micropaleontological record of how sensitive marine ecosystems are to global change as well as how they recover. If successful, PALEOGENiE may help constrain the potential for adaptation as well as rates of evolutionary change, and ultimately could lead to meaningful insights and guidance for the next generation of Earth system models we need to better constrain the future response of marine ecosystems to continued fossil fuel combustion."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,930,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PHOENiCS"><Rcn>189857</Rcn><Nid>11799</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Photon-Spin Entanglement in Hybrid Cluster State Architectures</Name><PI>Mete Atature</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The last decade has witnessed quantum mechanics and information science merge for the debut of experimental quantum information processing. Despite the number of promising physical systems as candidates for quantum bits, scalability via a brute force approach faces serious technical obstacles. Developing distributed quantum networks is possibly the answer to the stringent demand of controllable interaction between high quality qubits. In these systems, the requirements are on the stationary qubits &#226;&#128;&#147; they need to be both isolated and accessible. The requirements on the flying qubits are that they need to be of reproducibly high quality, identical, and also they need to be able to interface well with the stationary qubits. We propose to realize an operational distributed solid-state quantum network relying on confined spins in quantum dots as qubits connected via a shared optical interconnection net used via single photons as flying qubits. Key milestones include high fidelity distant spin entanglement generation, implementation of spin entanglement purification, and formation of spin-photon hybrid cluster states in order to perform  one-way quantum computation protocols with incorporated memory.

We propose to develop novel program synthesis techniques, generating procedural code from declarative specifications.
Existing techniques apply synthesis at such a fine grain that they can never hope to generate code of the richness and complexity required by application-level programmers. In contrast, we aim to develop synthesis algorithms that leverage the collective programming knowledge captured in millions of open-source projects.
By using existing code fragments as components for synthesis, we enable synthesis to work at a higher-level of abstraction and synthesize realistic programs. Our approach represents a conceptual leap as it reduces the problem of generating code to the problem of checking whether existing code (or a combination of existing code fragments) is an appropriate solution. In some cases, this reduces the problem of synthesis to a problem of semantic code search. In other cases, it reduces the problem of synthesis over fine-grained components to synthesis as composition of coarse-grained components. The key problems are how to specify the desired behavior, how to find useful code fragments in the vast existing body of software, and the how to use synthesis to modify and assemble these fragments to form a program.

Our approach combines insights and techniques from research on program analysis, program synthesis, software engineering, and machine learning.

In this proposed program I aim to study chemical processes in nano-sized protein cages as mimics of bacterial organelles and to increase the general understanding of chemistry in confinement.
Towards this goal we will investigate the controlled in vivo loading of bacterial protein cages, i.e. encapsulins, with proteins and enzymes. This will allow us to study in detail the chemical conversions that take place inside such capsules and it will increase understanding about the reasons why certain processes inside these simple organisms are encased in the protein organelles.
Completely artificial protein organelles will be constructed by in vitro processes using the well-studied Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle virus cage. By employing DNA technology, cages will be loaded with a single enzyme, a sequence of enzymes or molecular probes. By obtaining this high level of control, we can not only study chemical conversions on the inside, but it will also allow us to monitor the physiochemical properties, such as internal pH, polarity and porosity of the protein mantle by encasing the relevant probes or host/guest systems.
In the ultimate stage of the proposed project the formed artificial organelles will be brought into cells in order to interact with the cell metabolism. CCMV has to be introduced by surface modification, while encapsulins can be formed inside these cells; albeit with different cargo. Such experiments have, to my knowledge, not been carried out and introducing new reactions inside these organisms can lead to new potentially interesting products or interfere with cell vitality. The latter can be of importance for the controlled disruption of bacterial cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QITBOX"><Rcn>111554</Rcn><Nid>11826</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut De Ciencies Fotoniques, Spain</HI><Name>Quantum Information Theory with black BOXes</Name><PI>Antonio Ac&#195;&#173;n</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"With QITBOX we aim to develop a novel device-independent framework for quantum information processing. In this framework, devices are seen as black boxes that only receive inputs and produce outputs. Our main objective is to understand what can and cannot be done for information processing using only the observed correlations among the devices. We will structure our effort along three main research lines: (i) Characterization of quantum correlations: the general objective will be to characterize those correlations that are possible among quantum devices; (ii) Protocols based on correlations: the general objective will be to understand how quantum correlations can be exploited in order to construct relevant information protocols and (iii) Applications to physical setups: here the previous results to concrete physical setups will be applied, such as the quantum-optical realizations of the protocols or the study of the non-local properties of many-body systems. The expected results of QITBOX are: (i) Novel methods for the characterization of quantum correlations, (ii) Improved or novel device-independent protocols, (iii) Proposals for feasible experimental implementations of these protocols and (iv) Novel methods for the study of many-body systems based on correlations. QITBOX is a highly-interdisciplinary project with implications in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering. The execution of the planned research work will provide a unifying framework for a Quantum Information Theory with black BOXes (hence the acronym). Such a framework will bring quantum information processing to an unprecedented level of abstraction, in which information protocols and primitives are defined without any reference to the internal physical working of the devices. This, in turn, will lead to much more robust practical implementations of quantum information protocols, closing the mismatch between theoretical requirements and experimental realisations."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,487,505</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QPROGRESS"><Rcn>185587</Rcn><Nid>11988</Nid><HI>Stichting Centrum Voor Wiskunde En Informatica, Netherlands</HI><Name>"Progress in quantum computing: Algorithms, communication, and applications"</Name><PI>Ronald De Wolf</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Quantum computing combines computer science, physics and mathematics to fundamentally speed up computation using effects from quantum physics. Starting in the early 1980s with Feynman and Deutsch, and gaining momentum in the 1990s with the algorithms of Shor and Grover, this very interdisciplinary area has potentially far reaching consequences. While a large-scale quantum computer has not been built yet, experimenters are getting more optimistic: a recent prediction is that it will take another 10-15 years.

However, the tasks where such a quantum computer would be able to significantly outperform classical computers are still quite limited, which lends urgency to finding new applications. This proposal will find more such tasks, and produce new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of quantum computing. It is divided into three workpackages:

1. Algorithms &amp; complexity. Find new quantum algorithms that are more efficient than the best classical algorithms, for example for matrix multiplication and graph problems. Extend our knowledge of the ultimate limitations of quantum algorithms, and possible parallelization (which has barely been studied so far).

2. Quantum communication. Communication complexity analyzes the amount of communication needed to solve distributed computational tasks, where separate parties each hold part of the input. Find new
distributed problems where quantum communication outperforms classical communication, and explore links with fundamental physics issues like the role of entanglement and Bell-inequality violations.

3. Classical applications. Apply the newly developed mathematical tools of quantum computing to analyze problems in other areas, as we recently did for linear programs for the traveling salesman problem. This
third workpackage will have impact regardless of progress in building a quantum computer.

So far this field of Quantum Chemistry has been dominated by theory. The difficulty has been to realize in the laboratory low enough collisional velocities between neutral reactants, such that the quantum wave nature could be observed. Recently we have demonstrated a new way of studying cold reactive collisions by magnetically merging two fast neutral supersonic beams. After 40 years where the reactive scattering temperature was limited to above 5 K we were able to continuously tune collision energies from hundreds of Kelvin down to 10 mK temperature, a reduction of almost three orders of magnitude [A. B. Henson et. al, Science 338, 234, 2012]. Importantly, we were able to show that at low temperatures quantum effects start dominating reactive dynamics with the first observation of orbiting resonances in a reactive collision. We propose to extend our novel method to study chemical reactions in the regime of Cold Chemistry where the reactants&#226;&#128;&#153;s de Broglie wavelength becomes larger compared to the characteristic interaction range. Theoretical predictions at low temperatures are extremely sensitive to the parameters used, routinely differing by orders of magnitude leading to contradictions waiting to be settled by experiment.
Our ability to reach low enough collision energies and resolve scattering resonances will be used to bring a radical change to transient species spectroscopy. We believe that our work will not only test the central tenets of Quantum Chemistry, but will also provide valuable information to other fields, such as Astrochemistry helping to understand the synthesis of various molecules in interstellar space at temperatures 10 K and below.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,982,908</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QuantStro"><Rcn>185575</Rcn><Nid>12010</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Quantum-Degenerate Strontium: Mixtures, Molecules, and Many-Body Physics</Name><PI>Florian Schreck</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In 2009 my research team created the first Bose-Einstein condensate of strontium. This breakthrough is the foundation of my research program, which will investigate quantum many-body phenomena with a focus on quantum magnetism and physics related to the quantum Hall effect. We are especially interested in studying unusual, strongly correlated quantum states, among them states with topological order.

The unique properties of strontium make it ideally suited to follow four different approaches to this physics.

1) We will immerse our quantum gas into artificial gauge fields, which e.g. let neutral atoms behave as if they were charged particles in a strong magnetic field. These fields will allow us to study quantum Hall states or topological insulators.

2) We will study SU(N) magnetism, which is an unusual form of magnetism not found in condensed matter, but of high interest for theory. A high degree of frustration can lead to spin liquid behaviour.

3) We will use sympathetic Pomeranchuk cooling of a potassium spin mixture by fermionic strontium to reach low entropy quantum phases. Our goal is to study magnetically ordered states and frustrated antiferromagnetism.

4) We will create RbSr ground-state molecules, which are polar, open-shell molecules. They will allow us to engineer unique quantum-many body systems with long-range interactions, e.g. lattice-spin models that can support topological states.

We will pursue this research not only on our existing Rb/Sr quantum gas mixture apparatus, but we will construct a new K/Sr quantum gas microscope. This machine will be very valuable to explore exotic quantum states. The properties of strontium will enable an innovative single-atom detection method based on shelving in a metastable state and quench cooling, which will allow us to take internal state-resolved, 3D, or super-resolution images of the lattice gas.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,799,148</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REINS"><Rcn>192408</Rcn><Nid>13474</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Responsible Intelligent Systems</Name><PI>Johannes Maria Broersen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>I propose to develop a formal framework for automating responsibility, liability and risk checking for intelligent systems. The computational checking mechanisms have models of an intelligent system, an environment and a normative system (e.g., a system of law) as inputs; the outputs are answers to decision problems concerning responsibilities, liabilities and risks. The goal is to answer three central questions, corresponding to three sub-projects of the proposal: (1) What are suitable formal logical representation formalisms for knowledge of agentive responsibility in action, interaction and joint action? (2) How can we formally reason about the evaluation of grades of responsibility and risks relative to normative systems? (3) How can we perform computational checks of responsibilities in complex intelligent systems interacting with human agents? To answer the first two questions, we will design logical specification languages for collective responsibilities and for probability-based graded responsibilities, relative to normative systems. To answer the third question, we will design suitable translations to related logical formalisms, for which optimized model checkers and theorem provers exist.

In a five year long collaboration with Sorin Popa, we solved many long-standing open problems in this area, including superrigidity theorems for group measure space II_1 factors, results on the possible fundamental groups of II_1 factors, and uniqueness theorems for Cartan subalgebras.

In the first part of the project, we want to establish new unique Cartan decomposition theorems for II_1 factors coming from hitherto intractable groups. Using methods coming from Lie groups, ergodic theory and geometric group theory, we want to reach such results for lattices in higher rank simple Lie groups, and for countable groups with nonvanishing L^2-Betti numbers. An important intermediate step will be the unique Cartan decomposition of Bernoulli crossed products.

Secondly we want to prove classification theorems for type III factors that are equally strong as the existing results for the type II_1 case. This includes a complete classification of the noncommutative Bernoulli shifts of the free groups and will require an intricate combination of Tomita/Takesaki and deformation/rigidity theory.

The methods developed so far bring within reach an attack on two of the most important open problems in operator algebras and functional analysis: the free group factor problem and Connes's rigidity conjecture. The exact progress on these problems is of course unforeseeable, but it is sure that the research on these problems will lead to an even deeper interaction between diverse areas of mathematics as operator algebras, group theory, functional analysis, ergodic theory, and descriptive set theory.

Billions of dollars have been spent trying to cure primary tumors but very little was spent in trying to detect or kill the highly aggressive tumor cells that cause disease spreading.  One of the reasons is that single cell studies of rare cells in blood still present a large challenge.  Single cell analysis remains tedious with many different instruments and protocols, typically taking a few days of hands-on work.  This slows down research, but also hinders the translation to application in future clinical practice.  In SCALPEL, we envisage a high-content, high-throughput cell imaging and sorting platform, more compact and easier to use than any existing single cell analyzer.   The high content results from lensfree digital imaging of single cells on a high speed CMOS active optical pixel matrix to analyze the morphology of cells.  The high throughput results from a highly parallelized fluidic matrix that steers cells at high speed over the CMOS imaging blocks.  Lensfree cell sorters can be realized in a cheap and compact platform, as all optomechanical components (lenses, detectors, nozzles,...) are replaced by nanoelectronics, advanced imaging and signal processing technology.

SCALPEL aims to perform a full feasibility study of this concept and will require to investigate the ultimate limits in:  1) maximizing image resolution and sensitivity to single cell morphological features obtained via lensfree holographic imaging; 2) maximizing cell manipulation speed in microfluidic systems via a high degree of parallelization; and 3) digital image signal processing with extremely low latency at reasonable power consumption.

It permeates and is intertwined with almost all aspects of our government, economy, and society.

From a security perspective, we observe is the tremendous dependency on communication that is being created. Many of the processes we describe above would grind to a halt should communication become unavailable. Although we cannot conclusively
answer what the impact of a 1-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, or 1-week lack of Internet communication on our society would be, but anecdotal evidence
indicates that even short outages have a profound negative impact on governmental, economic, and societal processes. We can only surmise
what the impact of a week-long Internet outage would look like after witnessing the almost complete halt in productivity of a major institution that lost email connectivity for 2 days.

Unfortunately, the current Internet is quite brittle, and has not been designed for high availability in the face of malicious adversaries. Recent patches to
improve Internet security and availability have been constrained by the current Internet architecture and business processes.
Consequently, the current state of safety and availability of the Internet is not commensurate with its importance. Numerous aspects of our society depend on a brittle network that runs with a relatively
small investment compared to its importance.

Nature&#226;&#128;&#152;s ability to replicate has led to the evolution of a wide variety of forms and functions for biological materials which cannot be achieved using current synthetic approaches. It seems likely that if we were able to teach plastics or other polymers how to template new copies of themselves that we would similarly be able to make new, impossible materials and hence further expand the potential function and properties of these materials. These new materials would provide enhanced properties and function (such as replication and evolution) that are not currently available to material chemists. This would allow for a best-of-both-worlds scenario with the development of robust synthetic materials, with tuneable properties including crystallinity, thermal properties, shape memory, and self-healing. Most importantly, by developing an empirical and perhaps even model-based connection between polymer sequence / composition and polymer properties it would be possible to begin to design new materials in a rational and knowledge-based way. Indeed, it could be argued that this advance would ultimately solve one of the major problems in materials science, multiscale modelling of polymer properties. It seems certain that achieving even a portion of these goals would open up a completely new area of material science. Hence, following the model of DNA, we propose developing a number of new routes for the preparation of sequence controlled polymers (SCPs) and specifically a new class of SCPs which are capable of replication and ultimately evolution. This will produce polymers and self-assembled structures with unprecedented physical properties and the ability to functionally interact and communicate with biological materials. Realizing this goal will allow us to bring new function to chemistry, through expanding chemical space to access new precision polymers</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,324,271</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SEARCHLIGHT"><Rcn>185672</Rcn><Nid>10725</Nid><HI>Fundacion Imdea Networks, Spain</HI><Name>A new communication paradigm for future very high speed wireless networks</Name><PI>Joerg Carsten Widmer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Due to the tremendous growth in mobile devices such as smartphones, tablet PCs, and laptops over the past years, a larger and larger fraction of Internet traffic is delivered wirelessly. Dealing with this vast increase in traffic is one of the most important challenges for future wireless networks. State-of-the-art wireless communication already operates close to Shannon capacity. The only viable option to further increase data rates is to use high bandwidth channels in the very high frequency part of the radio spectrum. However, this spectrum suffers from high attenuation and signal absorption, restricting communication primarily to line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios. This in turn requires a radical rethinking of wireless networking. We envision that future wireless networks will consist of many highly directional LOS channels for communication between access points (APs) and end devices. Such an environment is extremely dynamic, in particular for mobile devices. At the same time, such channels experience very little interference and resources that would otherwise be used to handle interference can now be used to further increase achievable data rates.

We propose to build a wireless network architecture that maintains directional LOS channels between several APs and (mobile) end devices. Data is transmitted via all of these channels and end device uses multiple antennas to receive and decode several such data streams simultaneously. The main complexity of the design lies in the selection of APs as well as the beamforming directions of their antennas, given the large number of end devices that future wireless networks will have to support. To speed up this decision process, the system maintains a map of the radio environment and learns likely sequences of beamforming patterns and APs. This further allows to intelligently switch off APs to improve energy efficiency. We believe that such a design is the key element for the scalability of future wireless networks."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,719,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SLIDEQUAKE"><Rcn>111555</Rcn><Nid>11825</Nid><HI>Institut De Physique Du Globe De Paris, France</HI><Name>Detection and understanding of landslides by observing and modelling gravitational flows and generated earthquakes</Name><PI>Anne Mangeney</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE10, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The goal of the project is to take a major step in improving the detection and understanding of landslides and their modelling at the field scale through the analysis of generated seismic waves. The seismic signal generated by landslides (i. e. landquakes) provides a unique tool to estimate the properties of the flow and its dynamics. Indeed, the stress applied by the landslide to the ground, which generates seismic waves, is highly sensitive to the flow history and therefore to the physical properties during mass emplacement. The strategy will be to combine a very accurate description of the landslide source, and the simulation and measurements of landquakes from the laboratory to the natural scale, by leading an ambitious interdisciplinary project involving numerical modelling, laboratory experiments and observation. The methodology will be to (1) develop thin layer models for granular flows over a complex 3D topography to alleviate the high computational costs related to the description of the real topography, taking into account the static/flowing transition and the fluid/grains mixture, both playing a key role in natural flows; (2) simulate the generated seismic waves by coupling landslide models to state-of-the-art wave propagation models. An ambitious objective will be to develop efficient coupling methods; (3) develop laboratory experiments of seismic emissions generated by granular flows to test the models and understand the physical processes at work; (4) analyse, simulate and invert natural landquakes making use of underexploited high-quality seismic and geomorphological data, in particular on volcanoes.
An ultimate objective will be to design a new generation of landslides models, reliable methods and operational tools for detection of gravitational flows, and interpretation of seismic data in terms of landslide properties. This tools will be transferred to the scientific community and to the observatories in charge of monitoring landslide activity.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,241</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPCND"><Rcn>185612</Rcn><Nid>10738</Nid><HI>University Of Southampton, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Supernovae: Physics and Cosmology in the Next Decade</Name><PI>Mark Sullivan</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Exploding stars, or supernovae, impact upon many diverse areas of astrophysics, from galaxy formation, to stellar evolution, to cosmology and studies of dark energy.

As we move towards the next frontier of defining a quantum theory of gravity, it is clear that they will continue to play a predominant role. The current project is aimed at obtaining a comprehensive  understanding of the dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems, exploiting various symmetry properties that one expects on physical grounds. Specifically, the aim is to come up with effective descriptions of a wide class of quantum dynamics in gravitational and non-gravitational theories using the holographic gauge/gravity correspondence.

One of the primary strands of the proposed research involves a critical examination of gravitational theories with higher spin symmetry. We will investigate the phase structure of such theories, the nature of gravitational solutions and notions of classical geometry in the presence of the enlarged gauge symmetry. Using appropriate generalizations of the gauge/gravity correspondence we will try to give gauge invariant characterizations of these concepts and further explore how such higher spin theories can be realized in string theory. A related strand of research concerns a deeper understanding of the gauge/gravity correspondence itself,  with focus on figuring out how collective behaviour of strongly coupled field theories leads to the emergence of extra symmetries, such as local diffeomorphisms in the dual description. Along the way we will also develop effective descriptions for collective dynamics of strongly coupled quantum degrees of freedom, both in and out of equilibrium.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,400,758</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SSS"><Rcn>185547</Rcn><Nid>11972</Nid><HI>It University Of Copenhagen, Denmark</HI><Name>Scalable Similarity Search</Name><PI>Rasmus Pagh</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Similarity search is the task of identifying, in a collection of items, the ones that are &#226;&#128;&#156;similar&#226;&#128;&#157; to a given

recognition, statistics, and machine learning) where data sets are often big, high dimensional, and
possibly noisy. State-of-the-art methods for similarity search offer only weak guarantees when faced with
big data. Either the space overhead is excessive (1000s of times larger than the space for the data itself),
or the work needed to report the similar items may be comparable to the work needed to go through all
items (even if just a tiny fraction of the items are similar). As a result, many applications have to resort to
the use of ad-hoc solutions with only weak theoretical guarantees.

This proposal aims at strengthening the theoretical foundation of scalable similarity search, and
developing novel practical similarity search methods backed by theory. In particular we will:

- Leverage new types of embeddings that are kernelized, asymmetric, and complex-valued.

- Consider statistical models of noise in data, and design similarity search data structures whose
performance guarantees are phrased in statistical terms.

- Build a new theory of the communication complexity of distributed, dynamic similarity search,
emphasizing the communication bottleneck present in modern computing infrastructures.

The objective is to produce new methods for similarity search that are: 1) Provably robust, 2) scalable
to large and high-dimensional data sets, 3) substantially more resource efficient than current state-ofthe-

The major goal of this proposal is to remedy this persistent condition of uncertainty and controversy. The solution to the TP-AGB star conundrum will be provided by a new approach, which stands on the optimised integration of a) state-of-the-art theoretical tools to account for the complex physics of TP-AGB stars (evolution, nucleosynthesis, pulsation, winds, dust formation, etc.), and b) exceptionally high-quality observations of resolved TP-AGB stellar populations in stars clusters and nearby galaxies (Magellanic Clouds, M31, dwarf galaxies up to 4 Mpc) with reliable measurements of their star formation histories. We will adopt a global calibration method, in which TP-AGB evolution models are required to simultaneously reproduce a set of well-defined observational constraints (distributions of luminosities, colours, pulsation periods, dust mass-loss rates, expansion velocities of dusty envelopes, etc.). This project will deepen our understanding of TP-AGB physics profoundly, and provide wide-spread community benefits as well. We will publicly release well-tested and reliable ``TP-AGB products'', including stellar tracks, isochrones in all photometric systems, and chemical yields for both gas and dust.

Although almost all the components of any portable device become smaller, lighter and more powerful by the months, electrochemical technology is far from presenting us with the ideal battery. From a different perspective, the equation mobile device = casing + electronics + battery could be simplified by merging the structural function of the casing with that of the energy source of the battery into a structural battery. This approach would immediately reduce weight and size of our mobile devices.

This project aims at investigating the effect of electrochemical-mechanical interactions on the mechanical performance of structural batteries. Understanding and controlling mechanical degradation in structural batteries is of prime importance given the dual structural-electrical function of these devices. In fact, the main concern when dealing with structural batteries is whether the internal stresses caused by external loads will influence the performance of the battery, and, conversely, whether the functioning of the battery will have a detrimental effect on its mechanical properties.  The complexity of these processes can only be addressed with dedicated computational techniques. This project offers a unique opportunity for the design and implementation of the first multiphysics and multiscale computational framework for the analysis of structural batteries. Macroscale processes originating at the level of a basic components will be elucidated through physically-based constitutive laws.

The overall impact of this project will be felt across many research communities.

While one usually considers the substrate to be perfectly rigid, in many practically important circumstances the surface exhibits strong elastic deformations. Examples of such &#226;&#128;&#156;Soft Wetting&#226;&#128;&#157; phenomena are drops spreading on a gel, or roller bearings under heavy loads. Given the increasing technology to control and tune properties of soft matter, there is a strong need for better understanding of: (i) interaction of surface forces (capillarity) and elasticity, and (ii) coupling between fluid flow and visco-elastic dissipation in the solid. The central objective of the proposed research is to establish the governing principles for Soft Wetting and to develop tools for describing practically relevant situations.

The current approach to elastocapillary interactions is almost exclusively based on macroscopic descriptions, leading to contradictory results. I propose to change this by employing truly microscopic methods, namely Molecular Dynamics simulations and (simplified) Density Functional Theory. This will reveal how elastic stresses &#226;&#128;&#147; induced by liquid interactions on a molecular level &#226;&#128;&#147; are transmitted in the superficial layers of the solid. From a macroscopic perspective, there is mounting evidence that the visco-elastic rheology of the solid is very important for the dynamics of Soft Wetting: for example, drops spread much more slowly than expected on soft elastomeric surfaces. My goal is to reveal the connection between macroscopic motion and the rheology of the substrate. Experimentally, we combine high-speed visualization of drop spreading with a complete characterization of the substrate rheology. These experiments are complemented by Lattice Boltzmann simulations that account explicitly for visco-elastic substrates. As a whole, the project will provide basic knowledge and methods for a broad class of Soft Wetting phenomena.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,782,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SpecMAT"><Rcn>189840</Rcn><Nid>11812</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Spectroscopy of exotic nuclei in a Magnetic Active Target</Name><PI>Riccardo Raabe</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>SpecMAT aims at providing crucial experimental information to answer key questions about the structure of atomic nuclei:

- What are the forces driving the shell structure in nuclei and how do they change in nuclei far from stability?

- Do we understand shape coexistence in nuclei, and what are the mechanisms controlling its appearance?

The position of natural and &#226;&#128;&#156;intruder&#226;&#128;&#157; shells will be mapped in two critical regions, the neutron-rich nuclei around Z = 28 and the neutron-deficient nuclei around Z = 82. The centroids of the shell strength are derived from the complete spectroscopy of those systems in nucleon-transfer measurements. This method will be applied for the first time in the region of neutron-deficient Pb nuclei.

In SpecMAT (Spectroscopy of exotic nuclei in a Magnetic Active Target) a novel instrument will overcome the present challenges in performing such measurements with very weak beams of unstable nuclei. It combines high luminosity, high efficiency and a very large dynamic range and allows detection of both charged-particle and gamma-ray radiation. The instrument owns its remarkable performances to a number of advanced technologies concerning the use of electronics, gaseous detectors and gamma-ray detectors in a magnetic field.

The SpecMAT detector will be coupled to the HIE-ISOLDE facility for the production and post-acceleration of radioactive ion beams in construction at CERN in Geneva. HIE-ISOLDE will provide world-unique beams thanks to the use of the proton injector of the CERN complex.

If successful, SpecMAT at HIE-ISOLDE will produce specific results in nuclear structure which cannot be reached by other programmes elsewhere. Such results will have a significant impact on the present theories and models of the atomic nucleus.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,944,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="StrucLim"><Rcn>192415</Rcn><Nid>13457</Nid><HI>Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia Renyi Alfred Matematikai Kutatointezet, Hungary</HI><Name>Limits of discrete structures</Name><PI>Balazs Szegedy</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Built on decades of deep research in ergodic theory, Szemeredi's regularity theory and statistical physics, a new subject is emerging whose goal is to study convergence and limits of various structures.

Catalysis is a vital component of many potential solutions to contemporary global issues and breakthroughs in catalysis would inevitably bring about change.
Among the most prominent challenges of the 21st century is the functionalization of abundant but unreactive C-H bonds as development of these transformations would enable the sustainable formation of new carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds, needed for the construction of vitally important complex molecules. Even more challenging is the direct, enantioselective functionalization of unreactive C-H and C-C double bonds which would lead to valuable, optically active products which are highly desirable for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemical industries.
The general objective of this proposal is to redefine the synthetic methodology for obtaining highly valuable, optically active products, used in life science applications, by using novel strategies, involving three unprecedented concepts which employ visible light available from the sun.

The main contribution that destabilises the electroweak scale comes from a top-quark loop. The key for addressing the naturalness problem is thus identifying the top partners that are stabilizing the weak scale.
We consider the following two general possibilities in which the partners have escaped detection:
(I) the top partners are light but elusive, this calls for a theoretical explanation as well as for new innovative experimental techniques for signal exhumation;
(II) the partners are  relatively heavy and the signal would consist of energetic (boosted) top from the decay of its partner. I plan to carry out a comprehensive research program designed to attack these challenges, and I believe that I am uniquely prepared to do this.  Regarding (I), as proven below, current searches have not considered the impact of non-trivial flavor physics, e.g. splitting between the first two generation partner masses, as well as the mixing between the top-partners and other flavors. The consequences are: (i) significantly weaker mass bounds on some of the partners (e.g. the scharm, charm-supersymmetric-partner);  (ii) improved naturalness as even the stops (or fermion partners) can be lighter; and (iii) modified Higgs rates in composite models.
Regarding (II), with collaborators I have been the first one to understand the difficulties of dealing with highly boosted top jets, and since then I was intensively involved in developing theoretical as well as novel techniques to study them, including coauthoring two important papers with the CDF and ATLAS collaborations.
To uncover these new possibilities, expertise in collider phenomenology and flavor physics is required. I have a proven record in these frontiers and thus, given the required support, am well positioned to pursue this quest to save naturalness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,434,154</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TOPOTRONICS"><Rcn>111578</Rcn><Nid>10062</Nid><HI>Universiteit Twente, Netherlands</HI><Name>Topological Josephson devices as a novel platform for creating and controlling non-Abelian anyons</Name><PI>Alexander Brinkman</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Surprisingly, in two-dimensional systems quasi-particles may exist that are neither fermions nor bosons. When these particles are interchanged, their joint quantum mechanical wave function is predicted to pick up any phase in between 0 (as for bosons) and pi (as for fermions), hence the name anyons.

Even more intriguing is the class of non-Abelian anyons where interchange of particles completely changes the ground state of the system. This phenomenon lays at the heart of a wealth of theoretical proposals for new types of quantum statistics and topological quantum computation that is robust against decoherence. While theory has well advanced, experimental realizations possess their own challenges and are seriously lacking behind.

It is the objective of this proposal to experimentally realize a platform to detect and control non-Abelian anyons. We propose to combine the particle-hole symmetry of a superconductor with the spin-momentum locking at the surface of a topological insulator. Topological Josephson junctions are predicted to host Majorana type bound states at vortices. We propose to artificially create Josephson vortices at the junction of three phase-biased superconducting islands and to control and braid multiple Majorana states to prove their non-Abelian anyon character.

In preliminary experiments we have shown, as one of the first groups in the world, to be able to induce superconductivity in a topological insulator by the proximity effect. This puts our group in a unique position to open up the field of topological Josephson physics. The great technological challenges of the present proposal lay in the development of topological insulator materials with higher surface mobility and their integration into Josephson electronic circuitry with multiple phase biased superconducting islands. For the phase biasing as well as the read-out of the Majorana states after braiding on-chip SQUID based current amplifiers will be developed."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANS-NANO"><Rcn>111543</Rcn><Nid>11830</Nid><HI>Fondazione Istituto Italiano Di Tecnologia, Italy</HI><Name>"Advancing the Study of Chemical, Structural and Surface Transformations in Colloidal Nanocrystals"</Name><PI>Liberato Manna</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Colloidal inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) are among the most investigated nanomaterials in Nanoscience due to their high versatility. Research on NCs went through much advancement lately, especially on synthesis, assembly and on the study of their transformations, most notably via cation exchange (all fields in which the PI has contributed already). However, the integration of NCs with fabrication tools that employ conditions such as irradiation, etching and annealing is at a very early stage since we do not have a systematic knowledge of what transformations are triggered in the NCs under those conditions. Also, an issue related to the incorporation of NCs in materials/devices is whether, over time, the NCs will remain as they are, or they will transform into other structures. Plus, these transformations in NCs are poorly studied as they require fast recording techniques. This proposal will embark on an ambitious investigation of post-synthetic transformations in solution-grown NCs: by advancing the understanding of various aspects of chemical, structural and surface transformation of NCs, we will uncover new fabrication techniques that will employ such nanostructures as the key ingredients. This in turn will have a strong impact in opto-electronics, as several electronic components entirely made of NCs will be delivered. Four objectives are targeted: i) developing radically new sets of experimental tools for the investigation of chemical transformations in NCs, above all the ability to monitor in real time these transformations; ii) developing solution-grown nanostructures able to undergo programmed transformations under a defined stimulus; iii) understanding the role of irradiation on the fate of surface ligands and on cation exchange reactions in NCs; iv) combining chemical, structural and surface transformations towards NC-based opto-electronics.

We will compute rare transitions trajectories, first between two different turbulent attractors in models of planetary jet dynamics, and second between two configurations of ocean currents for a model of the thermohaline circulation. We will compute the dynamics and the probability for collisions between two planets in the solar system, on time scales of order of billions of years. We will evaluate rare events that lead to extremely large drags or torques on objects embedded in turbulent flows, directly from the dynamics. Because of the huge range of time scales, all those trajectories are not accessible through direct numerical simulations.

The project's unity stems from the methodology based on large-deviations theory. Large deviation rate functions generalize the concept of entropy or free energy in non-equilibrium extended systems: they provide a global characterization of their most probable state, their large fluctuations and their phase transitions. Impressive explicit computations of large deviation rate functions have been recently performed in simple non-equilibrium systems. The main aim of this project is to bridge the gap between those extremely interesting new concepts and algorithms, and complex dynamical systems such as turbulent flows, semi-realistic models of fluids related to climate dynamics, or the long time behavior of the solar system.

In order to achieve this goal, we will use macroscopic fluctuation theory, instanton theory, and other analytical methods in order to compute explicitly large deviation rate functions for essential macroscopic quantities (the velocity or density fields). We will also develop and use algorithms specifically dedicated at computing the statistics of extremely rare trajectories, based on the generalization of importance sampling implemented through cloning or multilevel splitting methods."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,178,760</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRITOS"><Rcn>111427</Rcn><Nid>10095</Nid><HI>Kungliga Tekniska Hoegskolan, Sweden</HI><Name>TRansItions and Turbulence Of complex Suspensions</Name><PI>Luca Brandt</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of this project is to forge a physical understanding of the transitions and of the turbulent flow of semi-dilute/dense non-colloidal suspensions, for different particle features and suspending fluids.
It is estimated that 10% of the world energy consumption is due to the transport and handling of granular materials of which particle suspensions are an important part. A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying the flow of particle suspensions, the transition to turbulence and the turbulence characteristics is crucial for many important practical applications involving engineered complex fluids, such as pastes and paper pulp. A better prediction and control of the flow of suspensions will therefore have a huge impact.
Complex fluids are multiscale by nature where the physics at the microscale affects the macroscopic behaviour of the flow and vice versa giving rise to surprising and spectacular phenomena as well as making this one of the most important practical problem still to solve. Investigating the mechanisms by which the system microstructure determines the macroscopic flow properties and vice versa will not only give valuable insights into the nature of flowing suspensions but also will also lead to new ways to model and control it. Future generations of engineering CFD tools will have to contain models for complex suspensions. The fundamental approach proposed here, combined with challenging scientific and engineering examples backed up by experimental evidence, will make this possible and demonstrate it to a wider engineering community. The proposed project is based on highly accurate simulations of multiphase flow systems and state-of-the-art experiments. Such a holistic approach will enable us to understand the underlying mechanisms of instabilities and suspension turbulence and to develop accurate criteria for their prediction far in advance of what we could achieve with either approach separately."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,350</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TheMoDS"><Rcn>185671</Rcn><Nid>12315</Nid><HI>University Of Cyprus, Cyprus</HI><Name>Theories and Models of the Dark Sector: Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Gravity</Name><PI>Constantinos Skordis</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Modern cosmology assumes that General Relativity (GR) is the correct description of gravity on large scales. With this assumption and according to current data, the cosmological model needs in addition the existence of a Dark Sector: Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We know very little about the nature of DM and it is yet to be detected experimentally. The simplest form of DE compatible with the data, a cosmological constant, has a value incompatible with our understanding of Quantum Field Theory. Given that the extrapolation of GR to cosmological scales has not been tested it is possible that the inference of the Dark Sector also needs to be revised.

I propose to (i) determine the nature of DM and DE to a level not achieved before, (ii) test gravity on cosmological scales and (iii) test the screening of new gravitational degrees of freedom in the solar system. The first two goals will require the use of my general framework to parameterize field equations [Skordis, PRD 79, 123527 (2008); Baker, Ferreira &amp; Skordis, PRD 87, 024015 (2013)]. My team will use this framework to construct simple models and observations to place limits on their parameters. We will employ the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations from ESA's Planck Surveyor and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We will determine the sensitivity of the CMB lensing to the properties of DM and theories of gravity. To break possible degeneracies these data will be supplemented with large-scale structure data, weak lensing and red-shift space distortions. We will also perform forecasting for ESA's EUCLID mission which will give us a handle on how well we will constrain GR with cosmology in the future. For the final goal (iii) we will employ the method of [Padilla &amp; Saffin, JHEP 1207, 122 (2012)] to construct a perturbative expansion of theories that exhibit screening, inside the screening radius. We will determine the compatibility of such theories with solar system and other strong-field data.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,150,691</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TopCoup"><Rcn>111222</Rcn><Nid>11836</Nid><HI>Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Bonn, Germany</HI><Name>Determination of top couplings in associated top pair events using ATLAS data</Name><PI>Markus Cristinziani</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The discovery of a new particle, compatible with the Higgs boson, at the Large Hadron Collider, marked a major triumph of the Standard Model of particle physics. However, many fundamental questions remain and direct or indirect evidence of new physics can be probed with the large number of proton-proton collision data, collected in 2011 and 2012 at 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy.

With this proposal we plan to exploit the large sample of top-quark pair events that is already recorded, and the sample that will be collected from 2015 onwards, at the ultimate energy of 14 TeV. In particular we plan to study the coupling of top quarks to neutral bosons, by measuring the production of associated tt&#204;&#132;&#206;&#179;, tt&#204;&#132;Z and tt&#204;&#132;H. Anomalous electromagnetic or weak couplings could be uncovered by studying kinematic properties of the resulting photon or Z-boson, once the signal is established. By studying the tt&#204;&#132;H production in detail the mechanism of Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to fermions will be tested, possibly providing important confidence in the characterisation of the new boson.

In all measurements we plan to include the tt&#204;&#132; dilepton channel, that, despite the smaller branching fraction has typically superior signal-to-noise ratios. An essential part of the programme will be the calibration of the b-tagging algorithms, where we plan to use tt&#204;&#132; events.

The Applicant&#226;&#128;&#153;s ERC StG has been very successful and opened new doors to several new avenues of pioneering research that were not even conceivable before the work was done. This work extends out from the knowledge achievements of the StG into new, exciting research areas that are completely different. This is a strategically vital to understand yet poorly developed area due to legacy nuclear waste. This project will deliver innovation through studying: (i) uranium-nitrogen triple bonds as benchmarks for uranium bonding and for generating new small molecule activation and materials applications; (ii) homologation of CO to close the carbon cycle and sustainably remove reliance on dwindling oil; (iii) single molecule magnets that have applications in data storage, quantum computing, spintronics; (iv) uranium-metal bonds which act as exemplars for intermetalloids and bonding. This CoG will afford the freedom and impetus via consolidated funding to undertake fundamental, speculative research to deliver &#226;&#128;&#152;big-hits&#226;&#128;&#153;, whole new fields of actinide chemistry, and, based on this higher platform of understanding, new ways of thinking. This will induce previously impossible paradigm shifts in uranium chemistry and be included in future textbooks.

Specifically, we plan to realize and study pairing with orbital angular momentum and pairing induced by long-range interaction. Besides the fundamental interest in unravelling unconventional pairing mechanisms and the interplay between superfluidity and quantum magnetism, our project will also lead to gaining experimental control over topologically protected quantum states. This will pave the way for future topological quantum computers, which are particularly robust to environmental decoherence.
Our project addresses three different aspects: (1) We plan to realize p-wave superfluids in two dimensions. This quantum phase exhibits topological excitations (vortices) with anyonic statistics and an isomorphism to the fractional quantum-Hall effect. We will investigate the unusual properties of p-wave superfluids, such as Majorana fermions, i.e. quasiparticles being their own anti-particles, which are predicted to be localized at vortices. This will boost the long-standing efforts in the cold atoms and condensed matter communities to understand topological states of matter. (2) We aim to realize d-wave pairing in optical lattices using a novel experimental approach. d-wave pairing is closely related to high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates and we are interested in exploring its interplay with magnetic order. Superfluidity and magnetic order are antagonistic phenomena from a conventional BCS-theory point-of-view and hence several fundamental questions will be answered. (3) We plan to induce long-range interactions using a high-finesse optical cavity leading to a light-induced pairing mechanism. We will search for Cooper pairing in spin-polarized Fermi gases mediated by the interaction of Fermions with a quantized light field. This provides access to a new class of combined light-matter quantum states.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,925,525</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ViDa"><Rcn>189848</Rcn><Nid>8693</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Transforming Raw Data into Information through Virtualization</Name><PI>Anastasia Ailamaki</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The unprecedented evolution of computing power, combined with the decreasing costs of computation and storage infrastructure, has revolutionized all scientific fields and enterprises; at the heart of this revolution is the ability to collect unprecedented amounts of data. Real progress, however, depends on how efficiently we can &#226;&#128;&#152;extract value from chaos&#226;&#128;&#153;, i.e., process the collected data and transform it into useful information. Unfortunately, despite the impressive growth of data management technologies,  data analysis application efficiency is hindered by the increasing data growth. The typical business intelligence architecture is far too complex to yield answers productively, with businesses operating large numbers of specialized data processing systems, with data being repeatedly moved, copied or transformed between them. The reason is that, despite tremendous progress, data management tools are based on legacy designs whose requirements are no longer adequate. A novel approach is needed urgently, or users risk losing the ability to leverage their hard-earned data.
In this proposal, we identify assumptions that do not scale with today&#226;&#128;&#153;s massive data explosion, and design a comprehensive end-to-end solution that implements a novel form of data virtualization to vastly simplify data analysis. Our approach removes barriers to data handling and maximizes efficiency for science, businesses, and their users, by enabling new forms of data computation that are unrestrained by how data is collected or stored.

The importance of the evolution of vorticity in incompressible fluid mechanics is very well known.

To date, only nonrigorous approaches are known to try to obtain an evolution equation for isolated vortex lines. Two desingularization procedures are carried out (including a time renormalization) to obtain an evolution equation (the binormal equation). While an isolated vortex line does not fit any known concept of solution (given the singularity of the velocity), and there has been significant recent activity on the nonuniqueness of solutions of Euler (De Lellis &amp; Szekelyhidi, and recently Isett) it is expected that the geometric assumptions made about the solution will still make it possible to find a suitable concept of solution. In the proposal I describe an approach that should help to rigorously understand vortex lines. It is motivated by a programme developed for the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation with C. Fefferman and for some related desingularized models with my student Zoe Atkins (Nov 2012 PhD).

SQG has been of great interest in the PDE community due to the striking similarities it exhibits with 3D Euler. In particular, the evolution of sharp fronts for SQG corresponds to the evolution of vortex lines. In recent years I have developed an approach  that overcomes the divergences known to exist for the velocity field (as in 3D Euler). The positive results obtained for SQG motivate the methodology and tools described in the proposal, including the construction of solutions with very large gradients and simple geometry and the use of a measure-theoretic approach to identify fundamental curves within these objects. Surprising connections with other equations motivate some other directions and linked projects, for example with Prandtl and boundary layer ther theory.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,182,858</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="WII"><Rcn>188684</Rcn><Nid>9909</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Water, Ions, Interfaces: Quantum effects, charge and cooperativity in water, aqueous solutions and interfaces"</Name><PI>Sylvie Roke</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), PE4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Sixty percent of the human body consists of water. Water provides the 3D-network for life&#226;&#128;&#153;s constituents. In a cell there are many interfaces: the average distance between two molecules or a molecule and a membrane interfaces is ~1 nm. Water and the interfaces it interacts with are of paramount importance for biological processes. The structural, dynamic, and biological properties of water, aqueous systems and aqueous interfaces are essential in understanding the complexity of life, and our ability to harness its features for novel technologies.
Waters&#226;&#128;&#153; 3D hydrogen bonded network is important for nearly all the macroscopic properties of water. The network is cooperative, yet it rearranges itself every few femtoseconds, and quantum level interactions determine its properties. Understanding the role water plays in living systems therefore requires information from the quantum level/femtosecond time scale up to the macroscopic level/time scale. Therefore, understanding water remains a considerable challenge.
I propose to investigate the structural, dynamic, and biological properties of water by probing the relationship between the properties of water on vastly different length and time scales. We will investigate quantum effects in water and on interfaces, and study long-range ordering (up from the femtosecond time scale). Furthermore, we will map how ions, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic solutes influence waters structural correlations and water-mediated interactions. Thus, we will use a worldwide unique multiscale toolbox that has for the most part been recently developed in my lab. We will map aqueous solutions by probing the structure of hydration shells, nanoscopic order and correlations between water molecules and viscosity.

Despite progress on coherent soft- and hard-x-ray pulsed sources during the last 10 years&#226;&#128;&#148;e.g. x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) or high-harmonic generation of laser light, nonlinear (e.g. 2D) spectroscopy or phase control of x-ray light remained a major challenge.

for the scientific goals
- (a) time- and quantum-state-resolved measurement of fundamental few- and many-electron dynamics
- (b) generation of soft-(electronic) and hard-x-ray (nuclear) frequency combs

For (a), a 4-quadrant x-ray time-delay unit will generate coherently-timed pulses out of one spatially coherent beam. For (b) a new physical mechanism relating Fano to Lorentz resonances and absorption to gain by a single temporal phase will be harvested.
Scientific impact:
(a): Site-specific 2D-x-ray spectroscopy will phase-sensitively test&amp;promote theory and allow to understand fundamental processes: excitation, ionization, and few-electron dynamics in atoms and molecular bonding orbitals.
(b): Impulsive phase control of resonant gain and absorption represents a disruptive key technology rivalling the LASER especially in the hard-x-ray domain, where long-lived population inversion in dense media seems impossible.

The fundamental nature of the models used is unprecedented and will represent a breakthrough compared to the more commonly applied statistical, correlative relationships. The methodology will focus on the intrinsic kinetics of (potentially) large-scale processes for the conversion of renewable feeds into fuels and chemicals. Non-ideal behaviour, caused by mass and heat transfer limitations or particular reactor hydrodynamics, will be explicitly accounted for when simulating or optimizing industrial-scale applications. The selected model reactions are situated in the area of biomass upgrading to fuels and chemicals: fast pyrolysis oil stabilization, glycerol hydrogenolysis and selective oxidation of (bio)ethanol to acetaldehyde.

For the first time, a systematic microkinetic modelling methodology will be developed for oxygenates conversion. In particular, stereochemistry in catalysis will be assessed. Two types of descriptors will be quantified: kinetic descriptors that are catalyst independent and catalyst descriptors that specifically account for the effect of the catalyst properties on the reaction kinetics. The latter will be optimized in terms of reactant conversion, product yield or selectivity. Fundamental relationships will be established between the catalyst descriptors as determined by microkinetic modelling and independently measured catalyst properties or synthesis parameters. These innovative relationships allow providing the desired, rational feedback in from optimal descriptor values towards synthesis parameters for a new catalyst generation.

It could, in principle, be the only planetary system in the Universe to harbor intelligent life or, indeed, life at all. As such, attempting to reconstruct its history is one of the most fundamental pursuits in the natural sciences. Whereas astronomical observations of star- forming regions provide a framework for understanding the formation of low-mass stars and the early evolution of planetary systems in general, direct information about the earliest solar system can only come from primitive meteorites and their components and some differentiated meteorites that record the birth of the solar system.

Our isotopic measurements will be obtained using state-of-the-art technologies such as second-generation mass spectrometers housed in laboratories directed by the PI and fully dedicated to cosmochemistry. This will allow us to: 1) define the mechanism and timescale for the collapse of the protosolar molecular cloud and emergence of the protoplanetary disk, 2) constrain the source and locale of chondrule-forming event(s) as well as the nature of the mechanism(s) required to transport chondrules to the accretion regions of chondrites, and 3) provide robust estimates of the timing and mechanism of asteroidal differentiation.

For example, mesoionic carbenes engage in bond activation processes via reversible hydrogen capture. Such cooperativity between the metal center and the ligand flattens the potential energy surface of a catalytic reaction and hence rises the competence of the catalyst, thus entailing higher turnover numbers as well as the conversion of more challenging substrates. Likewise, such cooperativity is expected to enhance the catalytic activity of metal centers that are typically not considered to be catalytically very active, such as the &#226;&#128;&#152;rusty&#226;&#128;&#153; first row transition metals (Mn, Fe, Ni). Surprisingly, however, this concept has largely been overlooked when designing catalytic transformations based on these earth-abundant and low-cost transition metals. This project will exploit the synergistic potential of mesoionic carbenes as synthetically highly versatile and actively supporting ligands to access a new generation of sustainable high-performance catalysts based on Me, Fe, and Ni for challenging redox transformations such as dehydrogenative oxidations. Specificlly, 1,2,3-triazolylidenes, which support ligand-metal cooperativity through their mesoionic character, will be utilized for (transient) storage/release of protons and electrons.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold.

In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis. Overall, we thus aim to establish the interplay between tumor hypoxia and the DNA methylome."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,920,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMATINREPAIRCODE"><Rcn>185661</Rcn><Nid>12025</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>CHROMATIN-REPAIR-CODE: Hacking the chromatin code for DNA repair</Name><PI>Haico Van Attikum</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our cells receive tens of thousands of different DNA lesions per day. Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#8217;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#8211; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#8217;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications.

The phenomena of cell competition and its participating genes have the potential to discover novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies against cancer and tissue degeneration."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,968,062</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHAMELEON"><Rcn>191995</Rcn><Nid>11222</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>Cellular Hypoxia Alters DNA MEthylation through Loss of Epigenome OxidatioN</Name><PI>Diether Lambrechts</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA methylation was originally described in the 1970s as an epigenetic mark involved in transcriptional silencing, but the existence of DNA demethylation and the enzymes involved in this process were only recently discovered. In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers.

Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2.  First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis. Overall, we thus aim to establish the interplay between tumor hypoxia and the DNA methylome."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,920,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMATINREPAIRCODE"><Rcn>185661</Rcn><Nid>12025</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>CHROMATIN-REPAIR-CODE: Hacking the chromatin code for DNA repair</Name><PI>Haico Van Attikum</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our cells receive tens of thousands of different DNA lesions per day. Failure to repair these lesions will lead to cell death, mutations and genome instability, which contribute to human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Efficient recognition and repair of DNA damage, however, is complicated by the fact that genomic DNA is packaged, through histone and non-histone proteins, into a condensed structure called chromatin. The DNA repair machinery has to circumvent this barrier to gain access to the damaged DNA and repair the lesions. Our recent work suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) help to overcome this barrier at sites of DNA damage. However, the identity of these CME, their mode of action and interconnections with DNA repair pathways remain largely enigmatic. The aim of this project is to systematically identify and characterize the CME that operate during DNA repair processes in both yeast and human cells. To reach this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that combines novel and cutting-edge genomics approaches with bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy. Epigenetics-IDentifier (Epi-ID) will be used as a tool to unveil novel CME, whereas RNAi-interference and genetic interaction mapping studies will pinpoint the CME that may potentially regulate repair of DNA damage. A series of functional assays will eventually characterize their role in distinct DNA repair pathways, focusing on those that counteract DNA strand breaks and replication stress. Together these studies will provide insight into how CME assist cells to repair DNA damage in chromatin and inform on the relevance of CME to maintain genome stability and counteract human diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,575</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CICHLIDX"><Rcn>185667</Rcn><Nid>10728</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>An integrative approach towards the understanding of an adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes</Name><PI>Walter Salzburger</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#226;&#128;&#153;s The Origin of Species, the identification of the processes that govern the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental problem to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while others have lingered unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote organismal diversity? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively recent species assemblages such as Darwin&#226;&#128;&#153;s finches, the Caribbean anole lizards, or the hundreds of endemic species of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, which are at the center of this proposal. More specifically, I intend to conduct the so far most thorough examination of a large adaptive radiation, combining in-depth eco-morphological assessments and whole genome sequencing of all members of a cichlid species flock. To this end, I plan to (i) sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several specimens of each cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika to examine genetic and transcriptional diversity; (ii) apply stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses in combination with underwater transplant experiments and transect surveys to quantitate feeding performances, habitat preferences and natural-history parameters; (iii) use X-ray computed tomography to study phenotypic variation in 3D; and (iv) examine fossils from existing and forthcoming drilling cores to implement a time line of diversification in a cichlid adaptive radiation. This project, thus, offers the unique opportunity to test recent theory- and data-based predictions on speciation and adaptive radiation within an entire biological system &#226;&#128;&#147; in this case the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,238</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CanaloHmics"><Rcn>189835</Rcn><Nid>10612</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Biophysical networks underlying the robustness of neuronal excitability</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Goaillard</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian nervous system is in some respect surprisingly robust to perturbations, as suggested by the virtually complete recovery of brain function after strokes or the pre-clinical asymptomatic phase of Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease. Ultimately though, cognitive and behavioral robustness relies on the ability of single neurons to cope with perturbations, and in particular to maintain a constant and reliable transfer of information.

So far, the main facet of robustness that has been studied at the neuronal level is homeostatic plasticity of electrical activity, which refers to the ability of neurons to stabilize their activity level in response to external perturbations. But neurons are also able to maintain their function when one of the major ion channels underlying their activity is deleted or mutated: the number of ion channel subtypes expressed by most excitable cells by far exceeds the minimal number of components necessary to achieve function, offering great potential for compensation when one of the channel&#226;&#128;&#153;s function is altered. How ion channels are dynamically co-regulated to maintain the appropriate pattern of activity has yet to be determined.

In the current project, we will develop a systems-level approach to robustness of neuronal activity based on the combination of electrophysiology, microfluidic single-cell qPCR and computational modeling. We propose to i) characterize the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons following different types of perturbations (ion channel KO, chronic pharmacological treatment), ii) measure the quantitatives changes in ion channel transcriptome (40 voltage-dependent ion channels) associated with these perturbations and iii) determine the mathematical relationships between quantitative changes in ion channel expression and electrical phenotype. Although focused on dopaminergic neurons, this project will provide a general framework that could be applied to any type of excitable cell to decipher its code of robustness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,972,797</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DARK"><Rcn>185621</Rcn><Nid>12329</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Dark matter of the human transcriptome: Functional study of the antisense Long Noncoding RNAs and Molecular Mechanisms of Action</Name><PI>Antonin Morillon</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"98% of the human genome is non-protein coding raising the question of the role of the dark matter of the genome. It is now admitted that pervasive transcription generates thousands of noncoding transcripts that regulate gene expression and have broad impacts on development and disease. Among the long non coding (lnc)RNAs, antisense transcripts have been poorly studied despite their putative regulatory importance. Several functional examples include X-chromosome inactivation, maintenance of pluripotency and transcriptional regulation. However, no systematic study has yet addressed the comprehensive functional description of human antisense ncRNA, mainly because of technological issues and their low abundance. Indeed, in budding yeast S. cerevisiae, our group showed the existence of an entire class of antisense regulatory lncRNA extremely sensitive to RNA decay pathways, impinging their study so far. The roles for yeast antisense lncRNAs in shaping the epigenome raises important questions: What are the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which antisense lncRNAs carry out their functions and are they functionally conserved in human cells? We propose that the dark side of the non-coding genome is another layer of gene regulation complexity that needs to be deciphered.
With this proposal, we aim to draw the first exhaustive catalog of human antisense lncRNA in various cell types and tissues using up to date High throughput technologies and bioinformatics pipelines. Second, we propose to determine the functional role of antisense lncRNA on genome expression and stability in the context of cellular stress and cancer. We anticipate that powerful and modern genetic tools such DNA-mediated gene inactivation (ASO) and TALEN approaches will allow precise antisense genes manipulation never achieved so far. Our project is strongly supported by preliminary data indicating an unexpected large number of hidden antisense lncRNA in human cells controlled by RNA decay pathways."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,884</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DDRegulation"><Rcn>185624</Rcn><Nid>10732</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Regulation of DNA damage responses at the replication fork</Name><PI>Niels Mailand</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims at delineating the regulatory signaling processes that enable cells to overcome DNA damage during DNA replication, a major challenge to the integrity of the genome as the normal replication machinery is unable to replicate past DNA lesions. This may result in collapse of the replication fork, potentially giving rise to gross genomic alterations. To mitigate this threat, all cells have evolved DNA damage bypass strategies such as translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), involving low fidelity DNA polymerases that can replicate damaged DNA, albeit in an error-prone manner, offering a trade-off between limited mutagenesis and gross chromosomal instability. How DNA damage bypass pathways are regulated and integrated with DNA replication and repair remain poorly resolved questions fundamental to understanding genome stability maintenance and disease onset. Regulatory signaling mediated by the small modifier protein ubiquitin has a prominent role in orchestrating the reorganization of the replication fork necessary for overcoming DNA lesions, but this involvement has not been systematically explored. To remedy these gaps in our knowledge, I propose to implement a series of innovative complementary strategies to isolate and identify the regulatory factors and ubiquitin-dependent processes that promote DNA damage responses at the replication fork, allowing for subsequent in-depth characterization of their roles in protecting genome integrity by targeted functional studies. This project will enable an advanced level of mechanistic insight into key regulatory processes underlying replication-associated DNA damage responses that has not been feasible to achieve with exisiting methodologies, providing a realistic outlook for groundbreaking discoveries that will open up many new avenues for further research into mechanisms and biological functions of regulatory signaling processes in the DNA damage response and beyond.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,356</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DEEPINSIGHT"><Rcn>192498</Rcn><Nid>13420</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Preclinical micro-endoscopy in tumors: targeting metastatic intravasation and resistance</Name><PI>Peter Friedl</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Poor prognosis of cancer results from two central progression events, (i) the intravasation of cancer cells into blood vessels which leads to metastasis to distant organs and ultimately lethal tumor overload and (ii) cancer cell survival and adaptation to metabolic stress which causes resistance to anti-cancer therapy and limits life expectancy. Using a novel multiphoton microendoscope device recently developed by myself and collaborators, I here aim to overcome tissue penetration limits and identify important progression events deeply inside tumors. The hard- and software of the microendoscope will be optimized for automated position control and panoramic rotation to sample large tissue volumes and validated for stability and safety.

Axon loss not only sculpts neuronal networks in development, but also occurs early in numerous neurological diseases. Indeed, the life-time risk for diseases with an &#226;&#128;&#156;axonopathic&#226;&#128;&#157; component approaches 50%. Pathological axon loss likely involves aberrant activation of developmental programs &#226;&#128;&#147; just as cell death in disease often takes the form of apoptosis, another prominent regressive event in neural development. Over the past few years, the first molecular pathways have emerged for one form of axon loss, Wallerian degeneration, which removes entire axon arbors after severing. However, Wallerian degeneration is of limited clinical significance &#226;&#128;&#147; because the axon is cut and hence incapacitated before it is lost &#226;&#128;&#147; and appears to play only minor roles in development. In contrast, &#226;&#128;&#156;non-Wallerian&#226;&#128;&#157; forms of axon loss that selectively remove individual &#226;&#128;&#156;aberrant&#226;&#128;&#157; branches dominate during development (&#226;&#128;&#156;axon branch loss&#226;&#128;&#157;). Due to the technical challenge of studying axon loss in the complex environment of the developing mammalian nervous system, the subcellular events that precede such non-Wallerian forms of axon branch loss are poorly understood, even though this phenomenon &#226;&#128;&#147; when pathologically reactivated &#226;&#128;&#147; likely contributes to axonal pathology in many neurological disorders. Over the past years, in parallel work on axon development and disease, my laboratory has devised functional imaging techniques that allow studying axon loss in vivo in the mammalian peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) with subcellular resolution and molecular read-outs. Using these unique tools, I will address the following aims:

1 - Axon-intrinsic mechanisms of motor axon branch loss.
2 - Axon-glial mechanisms of motor axon branch loss.
3 - Axon branch loss during CNS development.
4 - Axon branch loss after CNS injury.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIRECT"><Rcn>185650</Rcn><Nid>11384</Nid><HI>Universiteit Maastricht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Disabling Radiotherapy resistance in Cancer Treatment</Name><PI>Marc Antoine Gijsbert Gilles Vooijs</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cancer is a devastating disease affecting 1 in 3 people in their lifetime. The incidence is rising because of our aging population and causes a huge economic impact on our society because of hospitalization and lost productivity. Radiotherapy alone or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy is used in ~50% of all patients and uses ionizing radiation to induce DNA breaks that are lethal to cells. While significant progress has been made, radiotherapy is often limited because of side-effects in normal tissues and tumor control often fails because of resistance and metastases. Novel treatment paradigms are urgently needed. Among the key classical biological factors that determine radiation response in normal and tumor cells are the 4R; Reoxygenation, Repopulation, Redistribution and Repair. They are determined by intrinsic (genetic) as well as extrinsic factors from the tumor microenvironment and underlie tumor heterogeneity a hallmark of cancers and a decisive factor in clinical response. Yet, standard cancer treatments are largely based on the flawed assumption that tumors are homogenous within and between patients. We hypothesized that NOTCH signaling and tumor hypoxia cause tumor heterogeneity and are tumor selective therapeutic targets. First we will study key biological mechanisms that determine intra tumor heterogeneity, second we will establish their role in therapy response and third we will exploit this knowledge to enhance radiotherapy and provide proof of concept of a highly innovative approach to selectively activate cancer therapeutics targeting the NOTCH stem cell pathway in therapy resistant tumor cells without adverse effects in normal tissues.

Somatic cell reprogramming is overcoming this limitation through the derivation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can be differentiated into disease-relevant cell-types. Despite these tantalizing possibilities, there are critical issues to be addressed in order to secure iPSC-modeling as a robust platform for the interrogation of disease aetiology and the development of new therapies. These concern the taming of human genetic variation, the identification of differentiation stages in which to uncover and validate phenotypes, and finally their translational into drug discovery assays. This project confronts these challenges focusing on the paradigmatic case of two rare but uniquely informative disorders caused by symmetric gene dosage imbalances at 7q11.23: Williams Beuren Syndrome and the subset of autism spectrum disorders associated to 7q11.23 microduplication. The hallmark of WBS is a unique behavioral-cognitive profile characterized by hypersociability and intellectual disability in the face of comparatively well-preserved language abilities. Hence, the striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between WBS and 7dupASD points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage-sensitive genes affecting social behaviour and cognition. We build on a large panel of iPSC lines that we already reprogrammed from a unique cohort of WBS and 7dupASD patients and whose characterization points to specific derangements at the level of transcriptional/epigenetic control, protein synthesis and synaptic dysfunction. Through the integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling with targeted mass spectrometry and gene network prediction we propose an innovative drug discovery pipeline for the identification of new therapeutic leads.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,804</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DNAMEREP"><Rcn>185551</Rcn><Nid>12349</Nid><HI>Ifom Fondazione Istituto Firc Di Oncologia Molecolare, Italy</HI><Name>The role of essential DNA metabolism genes in vertebrate chromosome replication</Name><PI>Vincenzo Costanzo</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Faithful chromosomal DNA replication is essential to maintain genome stability. A number of DNA metabolism genes are involved at different levels in DNA replication. These factors are thought to facilitate the establishment of replication origins, assist the replication of chromatin regions with repetitive DNA, coordinate the repair of DNA molecules resulting from aberrant DNA replication events or protect replication forks in the presence of DNA lesions that impair their progression. Some DNA metabolism genes are present mainly in higher eukaryotes, suggesting the existence of more complex repair and replication mechanisms in organisms with complex genomes. The impact on cell survival of many DNA metabolism genes has so far precluded in depth molecular analysis. The use of cell free extracts able to recapitulate cell cycle events might help overcoming survival issues and facilitate these studies. The Xenopus laevis egg cell free extract represents an ideal system to study replication-associated functions of essential genes in vertebrate organisms. We will take advantage of this system together with innovative imaging and proteomic based experimental approaches that we are currently developing to characterize the molecular function of some essential DNA metabolism genes. In particular, we will characterize DNA metabolism genes involved in the assembly and distribution of replication origins in vertebrate cells, elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the role of essential homologous recombination and fork protection proteins in chromosomal DNA replication, and finally identify and characterize factors required for faithful replication of specific vertebrate genomic regions.

By combining transgenic Drosophila lines carrying secreted fluorescent proteins to monitor the barrier function
in vivo with a genome-wide siRNA screen we will establish a unique system to directly identify gene

primary podocyte cultures originating from transgenic mice that are TORC1 deficient, TORC2 deficient or
TORC1 hyperactive (TSC1 KO) solely in the podocytes.
(3) Potential role of podocyte regeneration in DN: Finally, to target mechanisms that could potentially
reverse the disease process (by repopulating lost podocytes), we invented a strategy to quantitatively monitor
podocyte turnover from different stem cell niches allowing us to precisely assess and potentially
manipulating the capacity of podocyte regeneration in DN.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,920</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DPR-MODELS"><Rcn>185652</Rcn><Nid>11990</Nid><HI>Deutsches Zentrum Fuer Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen Ev, Germany</HI><Name>C9orf72 repeat expansion in FTD/ALS- from mechanisms to therapeutic approaches</Name><PI>Dieter Johannes Edbauer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping genetics and pathology. The most common known cause is expansion of a GGGGCC repeat in the first intron of the gene C9orf72.

DPR aggregates outnumber the previously identified TDP-43 inclusions in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum. Some patients exclusively show DPR pathology, strongly suggesting DPR production is a key pathomechanism in C9orf72 mutation carriers.  However, we know next to nothing about the mechanisms of translation, toxicity, aggregation and clearance of DPR proteins. With this grant I will characterize this unusual pathomechanism in detail.
First, I will generate monoclonal antibodies for a comprehensive analysis of all DPR species to determine the best pathological correlate of disease progression. Insights from patients will drive mechanistic studies and will help to identify therapeutic targets within the DPR cascade.

There are few efficient anti-inflammatory drugs to treat chronic inflammation and thus, there is an urgent need to validate novel targets. We now know that innate immunity is the main coordinator and driver of inflammation. Recently, we and others have shown that the activation of purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) in immune cells is a novel and increasingly validated pathway to initiate inflammation through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of IL-1&#206;&#178; and IL-18 cytokines. However, how NLRP3 sense P2X7R activation is not fully understood. Furthermore, extracellular ATP, the physiological P2X7R agonist, is a crucial danger signal released by injured cells, and one of the most important mediators of infection-free inflammation. We have also identified novel signalling roles for P2X7R independent on the NLRP3 inflammasome, including the release of proteases or inflammatory lipids. Therefore, P2X7R has generated increasing interest as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases, being drug like P2X7R antagonist in clinical trials to treat inflammatory diseases. However, it is often questioned the functionality of P2X7R in vivo, where it is thought that extracellular ATP levels are below the threshold to activate P2X7R.

In order to do so, epithelia have developed, bearing ring-like paracellular barriers, with specialised membrane surfaces facing either the environment or the inner space of the organism. In animals, such polarised epithelia use specialised protein assemblies, called tight junctions, to seal the extracellular space, which have been a topic of active research for decades. Plant roots need to extract inorganic elements from the soil. A plethora of transporters are expressed in plant roots, yet, as in animals, transporter action is contingent upon the presence of efficient paracellular (apoplastic) barriers. Therefore, an understanding of the development, structure and function of the root apoplastic barrier is crucial for mechanistic models of root nutrient uptake. The endodermis is the main apoplastic barrier in roots, but, in contrast to animals, molecular data about endodermal differentiation and function has been virtually absent. We recently gained insights into the factors that drive endodermal differentiation, largely due to efforts from my research team. Our work has led a foundation of mutants, markers and protocols that provide an unprecented opportunity to test the many supposed roles of the root endodermis. Our preliminary insights indicate that generally accepted views of endodermal function have been overly simplistic. The topic of this proposal is to develop better tools and much more precise molecular analysis of nutrient uptake, centered around the endodermis. I propose to investigate our specific barrier mutants with new tools that allow visualisation of changes in nutrient transport at cellular resolution. The results from this project will provide a new foundation for models of plant nutrition and help us to understand how plants manage, and sometimes fail, to extract what they need from the soil."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,985,443</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EVOCOGN"><Rcn>185630</Rcn><Nid>11380</Nid><HI>The University Of Exeter, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Evolution of Cognitive Performance</Name><PI>Joah Madden</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"I aim to determine how cognitive abilities evolve under natural selection; one of the most important, yet poorly understood issues in modern biology. Comparative studies inform us how species differ, and hence, one can infer selective pressures. However, studies of how heritable inter-individual cognitive differences determine fitness in the face of natural selection are absent. I will use methods and paradigms developed in comparative psychology, cognitive science and behavioural ecology, applying them to free-living animals, and so determine how cognition evolves. Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) present an ideal system. Large numbers (100s) of individuals can be reared under controlled conditions and then exposed to natural selection pressures. Precocial chicks can be reared without differences in parental care. During rearing, chicks will complete a suite of automated cognitive training and testing, and their performance will be recorded. Conditions before and during rearing will be manipulated including maternal investment in eggs and diet complexity during rearing. Crucially, these captive reared birds will be released and exposed to natural selection. Surviving birds will be recaptured and bred from, producing large broods so that heritability can be studied. Empirical work will describe how individuals vary in their performance across a suite of cognitive domains; how such performance links to their natural behaviours; how their performance contributes to their fitness; how variation in performance is inherited; and how variation in performance is influenced by early life maternal or environmental factors. These are all significant steps in themselves, but the real strength of this project is addressing them in synchrony in a single, free-living study system. This provides a robust framework to tackle the broad question of how cognitive performance evolves that can be applied across a wider suite of conditions and taxa, including humans."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,450,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EVOLECOCOG"><Rcn>192566</Rcn><Nid>13444</Nid><HI>University College Cork, National University Of Ireland, Cork, Ireland</HI><Name>The evolutionary ecology of cognition across a heterogeneous landscape</Name><PI>John Leo Quinn</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Why do individuals vary in their cognitive abilities? This proposal takes the disciplines of cognition and evolutionary biology into a natural setting to answer this question by investigating a variety of proximate causes and population-level consequences of individual variation in cognitive ability. It represents the first large-scale integrative study of cognitive ability on any wild population. State of the art observational (remote sensing and automated self-administration trials of learning in the wild), chemical (stable isotope analysis of diet), physiological (stress, energetics, immunocompetence), molecular (DNA fingerprinting and metabarcoding) and analytical (reaction norm, quantitative genetic) techniques will be used.

The proposal&#226;&#128;&#153;s broad scope is captured in three objectives: 1) To characterise proximate causes of variation in cognitive (associative/reversal learning; problem solving; brain size) and other traits (the reactive-proactive personality axis; bill morphology), all of which can influence similar ecologically important behaviour. Quantitative genetic, social, parasite-mediated, and physiological causes will be explored. 2) To examine links between these traits, and key behaviours and trade-offs, e.g., space use, niche specialization, predation, parental care and promiscuity; and 3) To examine the consequences of this variation for life histories and fitness. The research team consists of the PI, five early career biologists, and three PhD students, and will collaborate with eight researchers from Europe and further afield. The project will reveal ground-breaking insight into why individuals vary in their cognitive ability.

In order to further enhance the evolutionary comparison of molecular sequences, this project will develop a complementary approach, the use of large complex similarity networks (typically a few million nodes and tens of millions of edges), adapted to evolutionary biology questions. Such networks, inspired by the studies on social and regulatory networks, are only currently studied by a limited number of research teams. They allow for fast inclusive comparative analyses of both (highly) divergent and conserved sequences, fully or partly similar. This project will consist in developing similarity networks to (i) identify and study chimeric genes and genomes, (ii) detect and analyze the common genetic goods shared between gene families and within microbial communities, (iii) test whether genetic diversity in environmental sequences is significantly larger, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than genetic diversity in the gene families of cultured organisms (and their MGE), (iv) improve the statistical framework to compare similarity networks.

What are the genetic mechanisms underlying neural circuit evolution? The project addresses this fundamental question in the Drosophila olfactory system, a superior ""evo-neuro"" model for several reasons: (i) as in mammals, the Drosophila olfactory system has a modular organization, with individual olfactory receptors functionally and anatomically defining discrete sensory circuits that can be traced from the periphery to the brain; (ii) these circuits are dynamically evolving, with frequent acquisition (and loss) of receptors, olfactory neurons and odor-evoked behaviors with the ever-changing landscape of environmental volatiles; (iii) Drosophila offers unparalleled experimental accessibility to visualize and manipulate neural circuits; (iv) a wealth of insect genomes permits comparative studies to relate intra- and interspecific genotypic and phenotypic variation. Five aims address distinct aspects of olfactory circuit evolution: 1. Evolution of receptor specificity; 2. Evolution of receptor expression; 3. Evolution of sensory neuron targeting; 4. Evolution of interneuron wiring; 5. Evolution of olfactory behavior. This multidisciplinary project uses cutting-edge approaches in comparative genomics, electrophysiology, neurogenetics, transcriptomics, behavioral tracking and population genetics. By addressing how particular olfactory circuits and behaviors have evolved in Drosophila, it will provide general insights into the genetic mechanisms of nervous system evolution relevant both for other brain regions and for other species.

Our lab has recently developed new methods to study by lineage tracing the cellular hierarchy that sustains homeostasis and repair of the epidermis and to identify distinct populations of SCs and progenitors ensuring mammary gland and prostate postnatal development.

While quantitative clonal analysis combined with mathematical modeling has been used recently to decipher the cellular basis of tissue homeostasis, such experimental approaches have never been used so far in mammals to investigate the cellular hierarchy acting during tissue expansion such as postnatal development and tissue repair.

In this project, we will use a multi-disciplinary approach combining mouse genetic lineage tracing and clonal analysis, mathematical modeling, proliferation kinetics, transcriptional profiling, and functional experiments to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating tissue expansion during epithelial development and tissue repair and how the fate of these cells is controlled during this process.

1. We will define the clonal and proliferation dynamics of tissue expansion in the epidermis, the mammary gland and the prostate during postnatal growth and adult tissue regeneration.
2. We will define the clonal and proliferation dynamics of tissue expansion in the adult epidermis following wounding and mechanical force mediated tissue expansion.
3. We will define the mechanisms that regulate the switch from multipotent to unipotent cell fate during development of glandular epithelia.

Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tissue growth and expansion during development and how these mechanisms differ from tissue regeneration in adult may have important implications for understanding the causes of certain developmental defects and for regenerative medicine.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,400,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EpiMechanism"><Rcn>188671</Rcn><Nid>13164</Nid><HI>Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, Portugal</HI><Name>Mechanisms of Chromatin-based Epigenetic Inheritance</Name><PI>Lars Jansen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Epigenetic mechanisms heritably maintain gene expression states and chromosome organization across cell division. These include chromatin-based factors that are propagated independent of local DNA sequence elements, and are critical for normal development and prevent reprogramming, e.g. during induction of pluripotency. We focus on the role of nucleosomes, the histone-DNA complexes that make up chromatin. While prominently implicated in epigenetic memory, how histones and their local modifications can actually be inherited is largely unknown. We take aim at three fundamental aspects that we argue are central to this problem: stability of the epigenetic mark, self-templated duplication, and cell cycle coupling.
We developed a unique pulse-labeling strategy to determine whether silent and active chromatin can be inherited and how this relates to transcription, both in cancer cells and in vitro differentiating stem cells. By coupling this strategy to an imaging-based RNAi screen we aim to identify components controlling nucleosome assembly and heritability. We achieve this by focusing on the human centromere, the chromosome locus essential for chromosome segregation which serves as an ideal model for epigenetic memory. This locus is specified by nucleosomes carrying the histone H3 variant, CENP-A that we have previously shown to be highly stable in cycling cells and to be replicated in a strict cell cycle coupled manner. We build on our previous successes to uncover the molecular mechanism and cellular consequences of the coupling between CENP-A propagation and the cell cycle which we postulate, ensures proper centromere size and mitotic fidelity. Furthermore, by genome engineering we developed a strategy to delete an endogenous centromere to determine how centromeres can form de novo and how CENP-A chromatin, once formed, can template its own duplication. With this multi-facetted approach we aim to uncover general mechanistic principles of chromatin-based memory.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,621,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EpiREPRO"><Rcn>188681</Rcn><Nid>12223</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Epigenetic Control of Mammalian Reproduction</Name><PI>D&#195;&#169;borah Bourc'his</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>By standing at the crossroads of generations, germ cells ensure species continuity. At the time of fertilization, the oocyte and spermatozoon carry the genetic material but also non-genetically encoded, epigenetic information. Gametic epigenetic modifications have immediate effects on gametic production and fertility. They also have long-term consequences on somatic phenotypes when transmitted to the progeny. Our team has previously made some important contributions to the emergence of these concepts. Here we propose to explore further the epigenetic control of mammalian reproduction, with a specific emphasis on DNA methylation-related events. How are DNA methylation patterns shaped? How do they impact on germ cell identity and integrity? How much gametic DNA methylation is transmitted to the progeny and how does this influence phenotypes across generations?
Our projects can be subdivided into three interconnected themes, which are at the heart of mammalian developmental biology and are not usually investigated as a common effort: 1) Trans and cis determinants of de novo DNA methylation, 2) DNA methylation and transposon control, and 3) DNA methylation and genomic imprinting. Our approach is mainly fundamental, using the mouse as a mammalian model, and will involve a powerful combination of genetics, cellular and developmental biology, with large-scale genomic and biochemical strategies. We are also extending our research to humans, in the hope of uncovering new causes of impaired or malignant gametogenesis. Correct DNA methylation patterns are paramount for the generation of functional gametes capable of forming viable and healthy offspring, but also for the regulation of pluripotency states and the maintenance of genome architecture and function in somatic cells. Our work therefore not only impacts on the field of reproduction and development, but also on stem cell biology and cancer.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,416</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EvoGeneticsTFBinding"><Rcn>185597</Rcn><Nid>11368</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Evolutionary genetics of transcription factor binding in closely related mammals</Name><PI>Duncan T Odom</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The genetic differences found in gene regulatory regions are the largest contributing factor to the diversity of phenotypes within and between mammalian species. However, the micro-evolutionary mechanisms active in closely-related species remain poorly explored, particularly in mammals.
In Aim 1, we will exploit five recently sequenced mouse species to determine how often genetic sequence differences alter both the genome-wide binding and regulatory output of a core set of tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) known to act combinatorially in liver. This project aim will establish the micro-evolutionary processes that drive interspecies changes in transcriptional regulation.
In Aim 2, we will create first-generation intercrosses of a subset of these mouse species to dissect the cis and trans contributions to TF binding differences between species, and to explore the functional implications for nearby chromatin and gene expression. This aim will also establish whether any tissue-specific TF binding sites show parent-of-chromosomal origin effects.
In Aim 3, we will use classically generated TF knockout mice to identify a set of functionally enriched TF binding sites, which will be further categorized by their conservation across the five mouse species. Then, using the revolutionary ability to rapidly and precisely delete individual binding sites (as well as combinations of binding sites) in the mouse genome by zinc finger nucleases, we will test whether conservation of these protein-DNA contacts can predict functional activity at target genes.
This integrated approach combines the comparison of TF binding in closely-related mammals with powerful new experimental tools to afford a comprehensive understanding of the genetics and mechanisms underlying the micro-evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,910,107</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EvolRecombAdapt"><Rcn>189843</Rcn><Nid>11809</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Recombination in Adaptive Evolution</Name><PI>Felicity Clare Jones</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Meiotic recombination is a key source of genetic diversity with considerable implications for the genomic landscape and evolutionary process. By shuffling parental alleles to produce novel haplotypes, recombination impacts the strength of selection on nearby polymorphisms, and can increase the rate of adaptation in natural populations. Recombination defects can have serious phenotypic consequences: inviable gametes, miscarriages and developmental abnormalities. Strikingly, recombination rate differs by orders of magnitude across the genome, among individuals, sexes, populations and species. Despite recent progress, we know little about how molecular constraints and evolutionary forces interact to shape recombination in natural populations. We will close this knowledge gap using threespine stickleback fish&#226;&#128;&#148;an exceptional evolutionary model system that bridges molecular genetic studies and adaptive evolution in the wild. This research program combines next-generation genomics with cutting-edge molecular biology and transgenics. We will 1) create kilobase-scale maps of the recombination landscape in adaptively diverging populations; 2) genetically dissect factors cis- and trans-acting factors that cause recombination variation; 3) characterize molecular mechanisms of recombination modifiers using cutting-edge techniques; and 4) test evolutionary theory that predicts natural selection favours recombination suppression in hybrids. This will significantly improve our understanding of recombination and introduce sophisticated genetic engineering techniques that further cement sticklebacks as an evolutionary model organism.

We will develop methods to analyse those responses using neuroimaging tools in order to create a new probabilistic atlas of functional tractography of the human brain, which will be made freely available to the clinical and neuroscience community. Several thousands of stimulation runs performed in several hundreds of patients will be included in the atlas database to reach a nearly full coverage of the human cortex (inclusion of 540 patients retrospectively and of 172 patients/year prospectively, from 8 French and 1 Czech epilepsy surgery centres). As a proof of concept, we generated for F-TRACT scientific document a preliminary database of 1535 stimulation runs performed in 35 adult patients.

Since tumor infiltrating Tregs can display function heterogeneity, depending on both the tumor type and the inflammatory milieu, only inhibition of the right Treg activity should result in the unleash of an effective anti-tumor T cell responses. Experimental plan: To identify the Tregs that truly inhibit anti-tumor T cells, we will profile by RNA-Seq the transcriptome of Tregs infiltrating both tumor and healthy tissues. In particular, we will focus on LncRNAs and the gene networks they modulate, since they have recently emerged as relevant epigenetic regulators of cell differentiation and identity. We will exploit this new knowledge to create a panel of regulatory transcripts, which will be assessed at single cell level on tumor infiltrating Tregs, so to determine the association of specific transcripts with different Treg populations. Since downregulation of specific lncRNAs might be an efficient way to inhibit the &#226;&#128;&#156;unwanted&#226;&#128;&#157; Tregs at tumor sites, we aim at targeting lncRNAs uniquely expressed in these Tregs and propose to develop AsiCs, chimeric molecules composed by an aptamer, single stranded oligonucleotides that bind to cell surface markers, and a siRNA, short RNAs downregulating specific lncRNAs. Deliverables and conclusions: this proposal will provide new knowledge on tumor infiltrating Tregs possibly allowing definition of molecular signatures of Tregs with either positive or negative effects on antitumor T cell responses. Moreover, we will develop new molecules that specifically target lncRNAs of interest and that will help identifying new antitumor therapeutic targets. In conclusion, the possibility to modulate Tregs effector functions may not only offer new anti-tumor therapy but more in general may be relevant to any immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GENEREGULATION"><Rcn>185550</Rcn><Nid>11979</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Deciphering the code of gene regulation using massively parallel assays of designed sequence libraries</Name><PI>Eran Segal</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Many gene expression changes that are associated with disease states have in turn been linked to changes in the genes&#226;&#128;&#153; regulatory regions. However, without a &#226;&#128;&#152;regulatory code&#226;&#128;&#153; that informs us how DNA sequences determine expression levels, we cannot predict which sequence changes will affect expression, by how much, and by what mechanism.

Here, we aim to arrive at a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of how expression levels are encoded in DNA sequence using a combined experimental and computational approach. To this end, we will construct libraries of &gt;50,000 sequences, fuse them to fluorescent reporters, and genomically integrate them to yeast or human cells. We will then develop methods for accurately measuring, in parallel, the expression of each fused sequence within a single experiment, and for measuring the DNA binding state of each sequence at single cell resolution, resulting in ~1000-fold increase in the scale with which we can study the effect of sequence on expression.

Notably, we will design our experimental system to be modular, allowing us to propose a highly ambitious yet realistic plan in which we will study the effect of sequence on (1) transcriptional and (2) post-transcriptional regulation; (3) Unravel the effect of genetic variation across human individuals on expression; (4) Quantify how cellular fitness depends on the expression level of individual endogenous genes; and (5) Construct a predictive model of the effect of DNA sequence on expression.

Each of our libraries should provide novel insights into a different aspect of gene regulation, leading to new means by which we can interpret whole genome sequencing, which is rapidly being collected for many individuals. In particular, our unified model should allow us to predict expression changes among human individuals based only on their genotypic variation, greatly enhancing the ability to identify common or rare sequence variants that may affect molecular function or cause disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GlycoTarget"><Rcn>185647</Rcn><Nid>12320</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>Exploring the targeted delivery of biopharmaceuticals enabled by glycosylation control</Name><PI>Nico Luc Marc Callewaert</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Most biotechnological therapeutics used in the clinic today and under current development, are of protein nature. Eukaryotic expression systems (such as yeasts and mammalian cells) for these therapeutic proteins add carbohydrate moieties (glycans) to the proteins, and these glycans strongly modulate the protein's in vivo biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy. Until recently, no adequate tools were available to accurately control glycosylation structure in these expression systems, but bio-engineering research in our lab and elsewhere has now largely overcome this problem.
In the GlycoTarget ERC Consolidator grant project, we aim at exploring the relation between the structure of the glycans on therapeutic proteins and the in vivo targeting properties of these modified proteins to different tissues/cells/subcellular organelles.
As highly medically relevant test cases for this exploration, we have selected three diseases with strong unmet therapeutic need, that could potentially be treated with glyco-targeted biopharmaceuticals through three different routes of protein delivery: progressive liver disease (intravenous), allergic asthma (subcutaneous immunization) and active tuberculosis (intrapulmonary delivery).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,760</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GreenProteases"><Rcn>189827</Rcn><Nid>11818</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Proteolytic Machinery of the Plant Apoplast: from Basic Understanding to Improved Recombinant Protein Production</Name><PI>Renier Adrianus Leonardus Van Der Hoorn</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The plant proteolytic machinery involves over 700 proteases that control the (in)activation of proteins. Surprisingly, although every protein is regulated by proteolysis, only very few natural substrates of plant proteases have been identified, and the diverse roles of e.g. secreted proteases are still poorly understood. These questions have become even more urgent since glyco-engineered plants are increasingly used for the production of recombinant proteins (RPs) to produce therapeutic antibodies, enzymes and hormones. Notably, transient expression by infiltrating leaves with Agrobacterium cultures (agroinfiltration) is cheaper, safer, more scalable and faster than any other protein expression system. However, glycosylated RPs are secreted into the apoplast where they are cleaved and degraded by plant proteases, many of which accumulate upon agroinfiltration. Therefore, secreted plant proteases cause heavy yield losses and obstruct the true potential of molecular farming in plants.

The aim of this project is to comprehensively understand the roles of proteases in the plant apoplast and to use this knowledge to improve recombinant (glyco)protein production in plants by targeted protease depletion.

To achieve this aim, my four objectives are to:
1) identify the major apoplastic proteases and their natural substrates and unravel proteolytic pathways;
2) annotate biological roles to secreted proteases in cellular homeostasis and microbial colonization;
3) understand substrate selection and develop software to predict cleavage sites in apoplastic substrates;

Remarkably, driver mutations of the histone H3.3 variant and its loading machinery have been recently found in paediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a devastating neoplasm originating from transformed neural precursors. Thus, the very basic building blocks of chromatin can be mutated in cancer.
The present challenge is to define at which level altered H3.3 loading influences GBM pathogenesis and provide clues into the underlying mechanisms. Based on work from our group and others, we hypothesise that alterations of H3.3 function/deposition would lead to epigenetic changes, deregulated transcription at bivalent loci and other genomic regions, and alterations of telomere maintenance mechanisms, in turn contributing to tumourigenesis.

The main objectives of this proposal are to:
1. Examine the impact of H3.3 mutations on brain cancer pathogenesis, by determining the effect of mutant H3.3 expression on neural precursor cell transformation (A), and tumour maintenance (B).
2. Define the molecular changes caused by incorporation of H3.3 mutants into the genome and their involvement in tumourigenesis, by A. determining the genome-wide distribution of WT and mutant H3.3 proteins, B. identifying mutant H3.3-driven transcriptional and epigenetic changes, C. defining effects on telomere maintenance mechanisms, and D. connecting mutant H3.3-driven molecular changes to the biological phenotypes.

The discovery of mutations in histones and their loading machinery represents a paradigm change in the field of cancer epigenetics. We anticipate this study to provide key insights into the role of these alterations in chromatin regulation and cancer pathogenesis. More broadly, this work will increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing chromatin modification in mammalian cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HEALTHMPOWR"><Rcn>192003</Rcn><Nid>11184</Nid><HI>Folkehelseinstituttet, Norway</HI><Name>A New Paradigm for Public Health Surveillance: Unlocking the Potential of Data to Empower Women and Health Systems</Name><PI>Jahn Frederik Froen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Rationale: State of the art health registries, cornerstones of public health surveillance, have hardly capitalized on the information and communication technology revolution. Many continue to be static, fragmented, and passive data repositories disseminating outdated reports only to a closed loop of public health officials.
Aim: In a radical departure from traditional science, this proposal introduces a new paradigm for public health surveillance: Maximizing the potential of data by disseminating data-driven individualized real-time information directly to women and providers to empower self-care in pregnancy and better healthcare delivery.
Research question: Is routine, data-driven and automated feedback from a reproductive health registry (RHR) effective in improving health behaviour and quality of care?
Plan: Based on the roll-out of a RHR in the Palestinian West Bank, four stepped wedged cluster randomized controlled trials will be undertaken to investigate the comparative effectiveness of a series of feedback modules to women and care providers. Main outcomes include adherence to evidence-based guidelines for providers, and self-care and care seeking among women.
Impact: Coalescing with WHO/NIPH&#226;&#128;&#153;s dissemination of the harmonized Reproductive Health Registries (hRHR) Initiative, the scientific horizons emerging from this proposal have potential for exceptional impact.

New technologies are driving an explosion of high-dimensional datasets that will sustain a continuing need for new methods, theory and computationally efficient software.

The methods development will be driven by, and applied to, several cutting-edge datasets in the fields of human disease genetics, population genetics and plant and animal breeding, guaranteeing impact on exciting scientific questions.

The first part concerns a wide circle of ideas around haplotype estimation, genotype imputation and analysis of sequencing data. The overarching aim is to provide a suite of methods that can estimate haplotypes and impute genotypes in a unified and computationally efficient manner.  In addition, we will work to create a reference set of haplotypes from tens of thousands of European and worldwide samples that will form a central resource for human disease and population genetic studies.

The second part concerns the development of models for high-dimensional phenotypic data in genome-wide association studies.

G-4s have been found in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, while very little information is available on viruses. The applicant research group has recently shown that HIV-1, which integrates into the human chromosomes and exploits cellular factors to activate transcription, takes advantage of G-4-mediated transcription regulation. G-4 disruption stimulates promoter activity while G-4 stabilization by small molecules inhibits it, showing a striking parallelism between HIV-1 LTR and eukaryotic promoter G-4s. Preliminary results indicate that similar G-4 structures form also in the viral RNA genome before retrotranscription. Available G-4 ligands, developed as anticancer drugs targeting DNA G-4, recognize both viral and cellular G-4s. Therefore, they cannot be straightforwardly used as anti-HIV compounds. The aim of this project is to develop highly specific anti-HIV-1 drugs targeting LTR DNA and/or RNA G-4s, using both reversible G-4 ligands and G-4-selective alkylating/cleaving agents, triggered by external stimuli. These approaches will be taken: a) to increase selectivity by 1) screening of ligands against LTR G-4s to select the best hits among libraries of G-4 ligands; 2) conjugation of the most promising leads to modified nucleic acids complementing LTR G-4 loop/flanking regions, to deliver the drug to its target; b) to stabilize binding by conjugation of the ligands to 3) an alkylating/cleaving subunit, and 4) an activable moiety (such as quinone methides) that alkylates the target only once the drug has reached it. Physico-chemical, biomolecular, cellular and viral assays will be used to tests the compounds. This approach should deliver reversible and irreversible ligands that selectively inhibit viral transcription and/or reverse transcription, thus preventing virus production and/or integration into the host genome.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,989,471</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HMRI"><Rcn>191254</Rcn><Nid>10603</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Non-Invasive In-Vivo Histology in Health and Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</Name><PI>Nikolaus Weiskopf</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding of the normal and diseased brain crucially depends on reliable knowledge of its microstructure. Important functions are mediated by small cortical units (columns) and even small changes in the microstructure can cause debilitating diseases. So far, this microstructure can only be determined using invasive methods such as, e.g., ex-vivo histology. This limits neuroscience, clinical research and diagnosis.

My research vision is to develop novel methods for high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T-9.4T to reliably characterize and quantify the detailed microstructure of the human cortex.

This MRI-based histology will be used to investigate the cortical microstructure in health and focal cortical degeneration. Structure-function relationships in visual cortex will be elucidated in-vivo, particularly, ocular dominance columns and stripes. Specific microstructural changes in focal cortical degeneration due to Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease and monocular blindness will be determined, including amyloid plaque imaging.

To resolve the subtle structures and disease related changes, which have not previously been delineated in-vivo by anatomical MRI, unprecedented isotropic imaging resolution of up to 250 &#194;&#181;m is essential. Methods for high-resolution myelin and iron mapping will be developed from novel quantitative MRI approaches that I have previously established. Super-resolution diffusion and susceptibility imaging will be developed to capture the neuropil microstructure. Anatomical imaging will be complemented by advanced high-resolution functional MRI. The multi-modal MRI data will be integrated into a unified model of MRI contrasts, cortical anatomy and tissue microstructure.

My ambitious goal of developing in vivo MRI-based histology can only be achieved by an integrative approach combining innovations in MR physics, modelling and tailored (clinical) neuroscience experiments.

In the present project, we will continue working on the immune homeostasis of the gut and we will focus on fundamental questions in mucosal immunity.
Three important and novel questions will be addressed in this project. The first aims at understanding how the gut microbiota is restrained from reaching systemic sites and hence it is tolerated only locally. We think that we have identified a new barrier at mucosal sites that avoids systemic spreading of bacteria via the blood stream. This is a very selective barrier that resembles the blood brain barrier and occurs at the level of enteric endothelial cells. The second question is closely related and tries to identify the role of the microbiota in the establishment/maintenance of this barrier and to understand its role during infection with enteric pathogens or in other circumstances (like pregnancy, liver disease). Finally, we want to characterize the activity of an anti-inflammatory mediator that we have identified. This is a short isoform of the well-known cytokine called TSLP. We think that this isoform is the one involved in the homeostasis of the intestine as it is the only one produced by epithelial cells in health and is downregulated during chronic inflammation.
This project is divided into three major aims.
1. Analysis of a putative gut vascular barrier that resembles the blood brain barrier and of the mechanisms leading to its disruption
2. Analysis of the role of the microbiota in the formation and maintenance of the Gut vascular barrier (GVB).
3. Elucidation of the activity of TSLP short isoform.

LSDs are fatal diseases of childhood occurring in 1:5000-7000 live births; in &gt;50% of the cases, LSD patients experience a severe neurological deterioration. Most LSDs with central nervous system (CNS) involvement lack a curative treatment. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) form healthy donors is applied to LSD patients in order to repopulate the recipient myeloid compartment, including CNS microglia, with donor-derived cells expressing the defective functional hydrolase. Over the past three decades, about 1000 HCTs have been performed for patients with LSDs with a variable benefit exerted on the CNS. The positive results obtained in Hurler syndrome and few other LSDs and the benefit observed in our on going Phase I/II clinical trial of HSC gene therapy for the demyelinating LSD metachromatic leukodystrophy indicate that migration of the transplanted Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs)/their progeny into the affected human brain occurs. However, timing of resident CNS macrophages and microglia replacement by the transplanted cell progeny is frequently too slow for clinical benefit due to the rapid progression of the primary neurological disease, particularly in the most aggressive LSD variants. Thus, a deep understanding of the modalities, time course and factors that affect this phenomenon might allow enhancing clinical benefit of HSC-based approaches for treating the LSD brain disease. The proposed work, combining basic and innovative preclinical research with the information derived from a pioneering clinical experience, will generate the basis for designing more efficacious and safer transplant approaches for these fatal diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,751,147</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Hairy Cell Leukemia"><Rcn>191330</Rcn><Nid>10769</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Perugia, Italy</HI><Name>Genetics-driven targeted therapy of Hairy Cell Leukemia</Name><PI>Enrico Tiacci</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL),  a chronic B-cell neoplasm, is initially sensitive to chemotherapy with purine analogs, but ~40% of patients eventually relapses and becomes less responsive to these drugs. Furthermore, purine analogs may cause myelotoxicity, immune-suppression and severe opportunistic infections. Therefore, molecularly-targeted less toxic drugs are highly desirable in HCL. However, its low incidence and the initial efficacy of purine analogs has made HCL an orphan in the world of cancer research and has spoiled the academic and industrial interest in developing better treatments for this disease. But recently we identified the V600E activating mutation in the BRAF kinase as the key genetic lesion of HCL (similar to BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia). Orally available specific BRAF inhibitors (e.g., Vemurafenib) have in the meantime showed remarkable efficacy in melanoma patients harboring the BRAF-V600E mutation, although resistance to such drugs eventually develops in this malignancy through reactivation of MEK (the downstream target of BRAF). The ground-breaking objective of this project is to introduce for the first time in HCL, by means of phase-2 investigator-driven pilot clinical trials, the concept of BRAF and/or MEK inhibition as an oral, non chemotherapy-based, entirely out-patient, genetics-driven and rationally designed treatment strategy, first in patients with active disease despite (or severe toxicity from) previous chemotherapy with purine analogs, and then, potentially, in the frontline setting. In comparison to melanoma, deeper and longer effect of BRAF inhibition may be expected in HCL, due to its much lower genetic complexity and proliferation rate. Anyway, potential mechanisms of resistance will be searched for to identify other genes recurrently mutated or aberrantly expressed in HCL patients developing resistance to BRAF inhibition (if any), and the clinical feasibility of combined BRAF and MEK inhibition will be addressed.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HostingTOXO"><Rcn>188655</Rcn><Nid>12210</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Toxoplasma gondii secretes an armada of effector proteins to co-opt its host cell transcriptome and microRNome to promote sustained parasitism</Name><PI>Mohamed-Ali Hakimi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread obligate intracellular protozoan parasite causing toxoplasmosis, a severe disease in immunocompromised or congenitally infected humans. It can infect any type of nucleated cells and grow inside a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) from where it directs profound changes in their transcriptome, proteome and microRNome. During invasion and creation of the PV membrane, apically oriented organelles called micronemes and rhoptries are discharged, followed later by release of dense granules content (DG). Recent advances have highlighted few strain-specific parasite effectors released from the rhoptry into the host cells where they neutralize cell autonomous immunity defences or subvert the host cell transcriptome thereby governing the fate of immune response and disease outcomes. Considering the magnitude of the repertoire of mRNA- and microRNA-encoding genes that is differentially regulated in host cells, it seems certain that other critical rhoptry- and DG-resident proteins that interact with host signaling pathways await discovery. By integrating diverse genomic-scale analyses and using reverse genetic, we identify novel DG proteins that are singularly exported beyond the tachyzoites-hosting PV to the host cell nucleus, thus extending the scope of the function of DG proteins beyond their dedicated role in vacuole formation. This collection of novel parasite effectors will be invaluable towards our goal of understanding how T. gondii actively remodels the genome expression of its hosting cell with profound and coupled impact on both parasite developmental process and the host immune response. We propose i) to characterize thoroughly the function of novel effector proteins secreted by T. gondii and ii) to explore how their synergistic or antagonist effects on host gene regulation contribute to promote sustained parasitism. An original line of research will be dedicated to determine by which means T. gondii re-programs the host microRNome.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,968,644</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IR-DC"><Rcn>189826</Rcn><Nid>11819</Nid><HI>Fundacio Centre De Regulacio Genomica, Spain</HI><Name>Individual Robustness in Development and Cancer</Name><PI>Benjamin Lehner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Biological systems are robust to perturbations, with many genetic, stochastic and environmental challenges having no or little phenotypic consequence.  However, the extent of this robustness varies across individuals, for example the same mutation or treatment may only affect a subset of individuals.  The overall objective of this project is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that confer this robustness and why it varies across individuals.

We will address three specific questions:
1. Why do inherited mutations have different outcomes in different individuals, even when they are genetically identical and share a common environment?
2. What are the mechanisms during development that confer robustness to mechanical deformation?
3. How can the loss of robustness be exploited to specifically kill cancer cells?

To address the first two questions, we will use live imaging procedures that we have developed that make the C. elegans embryo a unique animal system to link early inter-individual variation in gene expression and cellular behaviour to later variation in phenotypes.  To address the third question, we will apply our understanding of genetic robustness and genetic interaction networks in model organisms to the comprehensive analysis of cancer genome datasets.  The predictions from these hypothesis-driven computational analyses will then be evaluated using wet-lab experiments.

Understanding and predicting variation in robustness is both a fundamental challenge for biology and one that is central to the development of personalised and predictive medicine. A patient does not want to know the typical outcome of a mutation or treatment; they want to know what will actually happen to them.  The work outlined here will contribute to our basic understanding of robustness and its variation among individuals, and it will also directly tackle the problem of predicting and targeting variation in robustness as a strategy to kill tumour cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,812</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InflaMet"><Rcn>185586</Rcn><Nid>11386</Nid><HI>Stichting Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut-Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis, Netherlands</HI><Name>Mechanistic insights into the impact of tumor-associated neutrophils on metastatic breast cancer</Name><PI>Karina Elizabeth De Visser</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Metastatic disease is still largely unexplored, poorly understood and incurable. Accumulating evidence indicates that cells and mediators of the immune system can facilitate metastasis. Neutrophil accumulation in cancer patients has been associated with metastasis formation. In mouse tumor models, neutrophils have been reported to be pro- or anti- metastatic, but the underlying mechanisms involved in either function remain largely elusive. This proposal outlines a research program aimed at resolving the pro-metastatic role of neutrophils in breast cancer, as our preliminary data indicate that neutrophils proactively mediate breast cancer metastasis. Using a state-of-the art spontaneous breast cancer metastasis mouse model, we will mechanistically study how neutrophils facilitate metastasis formation and how mammary tumors provoke the metastasis-facilitating function of neutrophils. Building upon my previous studies and our current data, we will focus on the unexplored crosstalk between the adaptive immune system and neutrophils in facilitating spontaneous metastatic disease. These crucial questions will be addressed by undertaking a multidisciplinary approach, involving sophisticated mouse models for metastatic breast cancer, RNA sequencing on tumor-associated neutrophil populations, state-of-the-art mouse engineering, intravital imaging and in vivo neutrophil manipulations. Moreover, we will validate our findings from the mouse metastasis model in human breast cancer samples. We will determine the metastasis predicting power of the identified murine pro-metastatic neutrophil-specific pathways by immunohistochemistry and multi-parameter immunofluorescence on breast cancer samples and blood of untreated patients of which clinical follow-up is available. Thus, we will identify novel molecular pathways that can be targeted to selectively inhibit the pro-metastatic activity of the immune system.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,360</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InflammAct"><Rcn>191234</Rcn><Nid>11902</Nid><HI>Universitaetsklinikum Bonn, Germany</HI><Name>Activation and Regulation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome</Name><PI>Eicke Latz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The innate immune system protects the host from infections, detects and repairs tissue damage and functions to maintain tissue homeostasis. Several families of signaling receptors can recognize microbial substances or altered host molecules and orchestrate a coordinated inflammatory response. Inflammasomes are signaling platforms that control proteolytic activation of highly proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1&#206;&#178; family and thus, are relevant for infection control and numerous inflammatory conditions. In addition to recognizing foreign signals, the NLRP3 inflammasome can sense sterile tissue damage and various endogenous danger signals that appear in many common chronic inflammatory conditions. NLRP3 can be triggered by material released from dying cells and aggregated or crystalline substances, and its activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prevalent diseases in Western societies, such as type 2 diabetes, COPD, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by diverse signals however, the molecular mechanisms leading to its activation remain poorly understood. Using chemical biology screens and proteomics analysis, we identified that NLRP3 activity is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination. This project aims to identify the enzymes and signaling mechanisms leading to NLRP3 activation. In an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, we will employ chemical biology screening to identify novel targets that act to regulate NLRP3, and will describe the NLRP3 interactome in response to various triggers. Data obtained by these approaches will be analyzed by bioinformatics, and signaling mechanisms identified will be confirmed by RNA interference and gain-of-function studies. Utilizing a range of biochemical, biophysical and immunological techniques, we will determine the mechanisms by which the identified molecules can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and assess their physiological relevance in models of inflammation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,906</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IonDynDev"><Rcn>189850</Rcn><Nid>11804</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Ionic dynamics and plasticity in developing neuronal networks</Name><PI>Colin Jon Akerman</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Ionic gradients are a fundamental feature of the nervous system and its development. They are established by the actions of ion pumps, transporters and channel proteins that reside in the membrane of cells. And maintaining these gradients is a prerequisite for generating fluxes of ions, which in turn drive cellular processes. Ion regulatory mechanisms often differ between cell types and changes in intracellular ion concentration have been implicated in multiple processes in the developing brain, from proliferation, to process outgrowth and the refinement of synaptic circuits. One of the limitations however, has been the shortage of experimental tools for dissecting intracellular ion dynamics in the developing nervous system. Here I propose to capitalise upon methods we have developed for directly measuring and manipulating ion concentrations in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. The proposal focuses upon two key ions: chloride ions and hydrogen ions, which can exhibit intracellular changes over a range of timescales. Working in the neocortex of developing mice, optical reporters will be used to measure ion dynamics at key stages of mammalian brain development and light-activated proteins will be used to selectively control intracellular ion levels. The first series of experiments will investigate chloride and hydrogen ion dynamics in neuronal progenitor cells and relate this to cellular processes during cortical neurogenesis. We will then compare how developing neurons and astrocytes establish their ion gradients, as our data indicate that these two cell types possess different regulatory mechanisms. We will examine how emerging network activity influences ion dynamics and then selectively manipulate these dynamics to examine their contribution to synaptic development and ongoing network activity. The final series of experiments will examine whether developing neurons show homeostatic responses when their intracellular ion gradients are challenged.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,689,631</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LEARN2SEE"><Rcn>185638</Rcn><Nid>12019</Nid><HI>Scuola Internazionale Superiore Di Studi Avanzati Di Trieste, Italy</HI><Name>"Invariant visual object representations in the early postnatal and adult cortex: bridging theory, model and neurobiology"</Name><PI>Davide Franco Zoccolan</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our visual system can effortlessly recognize hundreds of thousands of objects in spite of tremendous variation in their appearance, resulting, for instance, from changes in object position and pose. Achieving such an invariant representation of the visual world is an extremely challenging computational problem that even the most advanced artificial vision systems are not fully able to solve. This is why understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying object vision is one of the major challenges of systems neuroscience and a crucial step towards developing artificial vision systems and visual prostheses.
Little is known yet about how the brain develops and maintains invariant object representations. The leading theory is that visual neurons exploit the spatiotemporal continuity of visual experience (i.e., the natural tendency of different object views to occur nearby in time) to learn to produce similar responses for temporally contiguous stimuli, so as to factorize object identity from other variables (such as position, size, etc.). This Unsupervised Temporal Learning (UTL) strategy has been instantiated in a number of computational frameworks, but its empirical investigation has received little attention. My proposal will use the visual system of the rat to address key questions about the nature of UTL and other learning theories, such as their impact on recognition behavior and object representations at both single-neuron and population level, and their role during early postnatal development. This will be achieved through a highly multidisciplinary approach, including high-throughput behavioral testing, in vivo neuronal recordings, immediate-early gene labeling, controlled-rearing in virtual visual environments, and computational modeling. This will lead to ground-breaking insights into the learning principles that sculpt the cortical representations of visual objects through unsupervised exposure to the spatiotemporal statistics of visual experience."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LEUKEMIABARRIER"><Rcn>185573</Rcn><Nid>12338</Nid><HI>Lunds Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>The Leukemia-Initiating Cell: Genetic Determinants, Escape Mechanisms and Ontogenic Influence</Name><PI>David Bryder</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults and strongly associated in incidence to advanced age. AML arises from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells via a sequential multistep process, but the nature of these steps remains to a large extent unknown. Therefore, while significant efforts have previously been invested in characterizing the molecular properties of late-stage AML, as diagnosed in patients, less information is available on the events that underlie leukemia initiation and progression. This includes the identity of potential mechanisms that restrict or eradicate developing leukemic cells; hurdles evaded at some point in time for AML to occur.
We have developed an inducible transgenic mouse model of AML that, when combined with high-resolution cell fractionation of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, offers a unique opportunity to track development of AML from the very first stages of cancer development. Using this, I propose to: 1) Identify and functionally validate molecular determinants that underlie why only some hematopoietic progenitor cells progress into AML, 2) To explore the extent and identity of immune surveillance/editing that accompany progression into AML, and 3) By building on my previous work on hematopoietic aging, to explore AML progression in the context of aging.
I anticipate the LEUKEMIABARRIER project to generate novel basic knowledge, not excluding with clinical relevance, with the potential to open up several new fields for further studies.

Ub can form polymers via 7 Lys residues of Ub itself. Recently, we have discovered that an E3 ligase complex, Linear Ubiquitin chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC)  generates a novel type of Ub polymer linked via Met-1, &#226;&#128;&#152;linear Ub chain&#226;&#128;&#153; and regulates NF-kB signalling in mice. Because linear Ub is unique and the study of it is still in infancy, the only E3 ligase known is LUBAC, comprising a catalytic protein HOIP, and two regulatory subunits SHARPIN and HOIL-1L. We have shown that SHARPIN deficiency leads inflammation in mice. A mutation in HOIL-1L gene of human was shown to lead immunodeficiency. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms of HOIP catalytic activity and the biological implications remain poorly understood. Here, we aim to

- Elucidate the roles of HOIP in Drosophila
- Elucidate the roles of ubiquitination and ligase activities of mammalian HOIP in vivo
- Identify novel substrates of human HOIP and clarification of their roles

We recently identified an orthologue of HOIP in Drosophila, yet its genome does not encode SHARPIN or HOIL-1L. We aim to elucidate how dmHOIP mediates linear ubiquitination in the absence of regulatory subunits and the roles of HOIP in the NF-kB signalling by genetically deleting HOIP in Drosophila. We further aim to elucidate the role of HOIP E3 ligase activity and ubiquitination in inflammation by generating the conditional knockin mice of HOIP mutants. Moreover, we will develop a protein chip assay to identify new substrates of HOIP and determine how they contribute to the biological functions.

Since Ub plays such a wide variety of pathological functions including cancer, inflammation and neuronal diseases, I believe the expected results not only will lead to a better understanding of functional role of HOIP but will also identify novel aspects of linear ubiquitination in human diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,908</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LifeWithoutInsulin"><Rcn>188654</Rcn><Nid>12207</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; De Gen&#195;&#168;ve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Metabolic actions of brain leptin receptors signaling in type 1 diabetes</Name><PI>Roberto Coppari</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>An established dogma is that insulin is absolutely required for survival. This notion has been supported by the fact that the sole life-saving intervention available to the millions affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM; an illness caused by pancreatic &#206;&#178;-cell loss and hence insulin deficiency) is insulin therapy. This treatment however does not restore normal metabolic homeostasis. In fact, the life-expectancy and -quality of T1DM people is worse compared to normal subjects. In part, this is due to challenging morbidities of T1DM, as for example heart disease and hypoglycemia, both of which are thought to be caused by insulin therapy itself. Indeed, owing to insulin&#226;&#128;&#153;s lipogenic actions, this treatment likely contributes to the ectopic lipid deposition (i.e.: in non-adipose tissues) and extremely high incidence of coronary artery disease seen in T1DM subjects. Also, due to insulin&#226;&#128;&#153;s potent, fast-acting, glycemia-lowering action, this therapy significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia; a disabling and life threatening event. Because insulin therapy does not restore metabolic homeostasis in T1DM subjects, better intervention is urgently needed. To these ends, we and others have shown that the hyperglycemic and lethal consequences of insulin deficiency can be rescued by administration of the adipocyte-secreted hormone leptin. Not only these results challenge an established view, they also raise a fundamental biological and medical question: what are the mechanisms by which leptin improves hyperglycemia and permits survival in the context of insulin deficiency? This proposal aims at identifying the critical cellular and molecular components underlying the beneficial effects of leptin in the context of insulin deficiency. Once identified, manipulation of these components has the potential to improve life-expectancy and -quality of the millions affected by insulin deficiency (e.g.: T1DM and also some late-stage type 2 diabetics).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MALMASQ"><Rcn>185589</Rcn><Nid>12012</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Understanding immune evasion by malaria parasites</Name><PI>Ron Dzikowski</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The deadliest form of human malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, which annually infects millions worldwide. Its virulence is attributed to its ability to evade the human immune system, by modifying the host red blood cell surface to adhere to the vascular endothelium and to undergo antigenic variation. Antigenic variation is achieved through switches in expression of hypervariable surface ligands named PfEMP1. These proteins are encoded by a multi-copy gene family called var. Each individual parasite expresses a single var gene at a time, whereas the remaining ~60 var genes found in its genome are maintained in a transcriptionally silent state, a phenomenon known as ""allelic exclusion"". These antigenic switches allow the parasite to avoid the human immune response and maintain a long-term infection. How mutually exclusive expression is regulated is still elusive.
The rationale of the proposed study is that understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the parasite evade human immune attack would lead to the development of therapeutic approaches that disrupt this ability and would give the human immune system an opportunity to clear the infection and overcome the disease.
I will focus this research project on understanding one of the unsolved mysteries in gene expression which is responsible for regulating antigenic variation in P. falciparum: the nature of ""communication"" between genes that allows expression of only a single gene at a time and the selection of the ""chosen one"" for activation while the rest of the gene family remains silent.
The expected outcome of this knowledge is new concepts for disrupting the parasite&#226;&#128;&#153;s ability to evade immune attack which will be exploited for the discovery of novel targets for drug and vaccine development. In addition, it will unravel mechanisms of allelic exclusion that extend beyond malaria virulence into fundamental aspect of gene expression in other organisms."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="META-BIOME"><Rcn>185584</Rcn><Nid>12002</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Deciphering the molecular language orchestrating host-microbiome interactions and their effects on health and disease</Name><PI>Eran Elinav</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The gastrointestinal tract hosts the microbiome, one of the highest microbial densities on earth. Diverse host-microbiome interactions influence a multitude of physiological and pathological processes, yet the basic mechanisms regulating host-microbiome interactions remain unknown. Deciphering the codes comprising the host-microbiome communication network and factors initiating loss of homeostasis (termed dysbiosis) will enable the recognition of pathways and signals critically important to initiation and progression of common immune and metabolic disorders. We recently identified the NLRP6 inflammasome as a critical innate immune regulator of colonic microbial ecology, with its disruption resulting in auto-inflammation and tumorigenesis. We will use this unique system, coupled with innovative robotic high-throughput modalities, gnotobiotics, metagenomics and multiple genetically altered mouse models to generalize our studies and decipher the critical principles governing host-microbiome interactions. We will elucidate the host-derived microbiome recognition signaling pathway at its entirety, from its upstream activators to the downstream effector molecules controlling microbial ecology; uncover the principles generating a stable microbiota composition; and develop and apply computational modelling to dissect the general mechanisms disrupting microbiome stability leading to dysbiosis. Using this innovative experimental and computational toolbox we will study the impact of dysbiosis on key components of the metabolic syndrome, and apply our findings to devise the first rational proof-of-concept approach for individualized microbiome-based treatment for these common disorders. At the basic science level, unraveling the principles of host-microbiota interactions will lead to a conceptual leap forward in our understanding of physiology and disease.

Recent studies indicate that socio-demographic and environmental factors are more important for disease development than genetics, and we and others have demonstrated that the gut microbiota can be considered an environmental factor that contributes to obesity. Effective treatment for obesity remains a challenge and bariatric surgery is the only available therapy that is proven to maintain weight loss. Intriguingly, bariatric surgery also improves glucose metabolism, but the underlying molecular mechanisms for this beneficial effect are unclear. An altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases and pilot studies indicate that the gut microbiota is also altered upon bariatric surgery; these findings suggest that some of the improved metabolic features following bariatric surgery may be mediated by altered composition of the gut microbiota. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate clinical research with mechanistic studies in mice to determine if and how the gut microbiota mediates the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery. We will define how bariatric surgery alters the gut metagenome in humans, both at a species and at a functional level. By transferring the fecal microbiota from these patients before and after surgery to germ-free mice, we will determine if an altered gut microbiota directly modulates host metabolism. Finally, we will establish surgical methods in germ-free mice to directly test whether the beneficial effects observed following surgery require a microbiota. Increased understanding of these mechanisms may provide the basis for non-surgical treatments based on supplementation of novel probiotics to treat metabolic diseases. Follow-up work in larger clinical cohorts may also indicate how patients can be stratified to determine who would benefit the most from bariatric surgery."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MICARUS"><Rcn>185605</Rcn><Nid>12331</Nid><HI>Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie Van Wetenschappen - Knaw, Netherlands</HI><Name>MicroRNA function in cardiac and metabolic disease</Name><PI>Eva Van Rooij</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite numerous treatment options the prevalence of cardiovascular indications continues to increase, underscoring the need for new therapeutic strategies.

In recent years, prominent roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been uncovered in a variety of cardiovascular disorders. miRNAs are short, single stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression by suppressing multiple, often related, mRNAs.
Our studies have focussed on the cardiac specific miRNA, miR-208. We showed that, in the setting of heart failure, genetic deletion as well as therapeutic inhibition of miR-208 resulted in reduced cardiac remodeling (less hypertrophy and fibrosis), the inability to upregulate beta-MHC (a sensitive marker of pathological cardiac stress) and improved survival.
Unexpectedly, mice treated with antimiR-208 displayed resistance to obesity and enhanced glucose metabolism in a mouse model of type II diabetes. These effects suggest that the heart plays a previously unrecognized role in systemic metabolic control via a miR-208 dependent mechanism.
Although these studies indicate a crucial role for miR-208 in cardiac remodeling and systemic metabolism, the mechanism of action still remains to be defined. Our preliminary gene expression data indicate a cohort of miR-208 targets to be regulated in our stress models, many of which so far have unknown or ill-studied cardiac functions.

The aim of the present proposal is to use genetics, gene expression analyses, stress models and antimiR approaches to study the relevance of downstream miR-208 targets for cardiac remodeling and total body metabolism and explore whether additional miRNAs besides miR-208 are relevant for cardiometabolic disease. Together these projects will increase our mechanistic understanding of miRNA function in cardiac and metabolic disease which will advance the clinical application of miRNA therapeutics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MIRNABETAIDENTITY"><Rcn>185656</Rcn><Nid>11997</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>microRNAs confer robustness to adult beta&#226;&#128;&#147;cell identity</Name><PI>Eran Hornstein</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Normal physiology depends on defined functional output of differentiated cells.

These discoveries necessitate investigations of key questions: How is cell&#226;&#128;&#147;type identity robustly maintained for decades in the adult organism? What are the genetic mechanisms for continuous maintenance of differentiation and identity? microRNAs, are known to impart robustness to differentiation. Do they play important roles in maintenance of adult &#206;&#178;&#226;&#128;&#147;cell identity?

Our overarching objective is to explore the exciting hypotheses that

(ii) microRNAs confer robustness to adult &#206;&#178;&#226;&#128;&#147;cell identity by repressing disallowed genes that are deleterious to &#206;&#178;&#226;&#128;&#147;cells.

The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#206;&#179; coactivator 1&#206;&#177; (PGC-1&#206;&#177;) is one of the major regulatory hubs of muscle adaptation to endurance training. Accordingly, elevated expression of PGC-1&#206;&#177; in muscle is sufficient to induce a trained phenotype in mice. Inversely, mice lacking a functional PGC-1&#206;&#177; gene in skeletal muscle exhibit many signs of pathological inactivity. Finally, PGC-1&#206;&#177; expression is dysregulated in pathological contexts in human muscle, including type 2 diabetes and aging. Therefore, the study of the regulation and function of PGC-1&#206;&#177; in muscle has the potential to yield important insights into the molecular mechanisms that control muscle health.
Unfortunately, the characterization of PGC-1&#206;&#177; is drastically hampered by the high complexity of the transcriptional network controlled by this coactivator protein, which binds to many different transcription factor binding partners in a cell context-specific manner. Moreover, PGC-1&#206;&#177; seems to directly couple transcription to RNA processing, thereby further complicating the analysis of PGC-1&#206;&#177;-controlled biological programs.

Firmicutes bacteria utilize as thiol redox buffer bacillithiol (Cys-GlcN-Mal, BSH) and Actinomycetes produce the related redox buffer mycothiol (AcCys-GlcN-Ins, MSH). In eukaryotes, proteins are post-translational modified to S-glutathionylated proteins in response to oxidative stress. S-glutathionylation has emerged as major redox-regulatory mechanism and protects cysteine residues against overoxidation to sulfonic acids. Using thiol-redox proteomics and mass spectrometry (MS) we have recently discovered protein S-bacillithiolations as mixed BSH protein disulfides in response to oxidative stress in Firmicutes bacteria. Protein S-bacillithiolation controls the activity of the redox-sensing OhrR repressor and protects active site cysteine residues of metabolic enzymes, antioxidant function proteins and translation factors. However, it is unknown if ROS and infection conditions cause protein S-mycothiolations and affect the cellular MSH redox potential in pathogenic Mycobacteria and Corynebacteria.

In pregnant women, malaria infected red blood cells express a protein that binds to a distinct carbohydrate structure present only on cells of the maternal side of the placental circulation, but not elsewhere in the vasculature. This highly evolved binding system enables the parasite to evade clearance and infect placental tissue, causing pregnancy-associated malaria. This malaria protein binds to most cancer cells with a highly specific and strong interaction. It is apparent that cancer cells commonly express this modified glycoprotein, also found on placental cells, but rarely on normal somatic cells. The carbohydrate structures enable cancer cells to migrate and invade surrounding normal tissue, and to play a role in metastatic spread of the primary lesion.
I have preliminary data showing that (1) the malaria protein binds specifically to a wide range of cancer cells and patient cancer tissues including melanoma, lymphoma, carcinomas and sarcomas, whereas no binding is detected to normal healthy cells or tissue, and (2) cancer cells treated with the malaria protein have markedly reduced growth and migration capacity.
This raises the intriguing possibility that we can use this naturally refined parasite-host interaction mechanism as a tool to specifically target cancer and inhibit the metastatic potential. Furthermore, as the malaria protein binds strongly to patient-derived cancer tissues, the malaria protein could be used to differentiate between specific subtypes of cancers and possibly advance the diagnostic process in clinical settings. The proposed project augments a novel strategy of targeting a wide range of receptors involved in human disease using pathogen derived evolutionary refined ligands. I expect this project to pioneer the use of inherently refined parasite-host interactions as a tool to combat human malignant disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MechComm"><Rcn>189852</Rcn><Nid>11262</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>Mechanotransduction in Cell-to-Cell Communication</Name><PI>Ana Isabel De Sousa Teixeira</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Cell-to-cell communication pathways coordinate cellular functions in multicellular organisms.

The objective of this research program is to address the hypothesis that the physical context of the ligand/receptor interaction contributes to defining the fundamental mechanisms of action of cell-to-cell communication pathways and their cellular outcomes.
The research program relies on the development of tools that provide well-defined physical inputs to cells, not confounded by simultaneous changes in chemical inputs. Therefore, beyond state-of-the-art developments in nanotechnology are here integrated with cell biology. In particular, DNA origami technology is applied to the development of ligand nanoclusters with customized spatial organization and mechanical properties. These ligand nanoclusters are used to probe the roles of physical properties of the ligand presentation on the activation of intracellular signalling pathways.
We will focus on the ephrin/Eph cell-to-cell communication pathway, which regulates embryonic development and the homeostasis of adult organs. ephrin/Eph signalling is commonly disrupted in cancer, showing tumour suppressing or tumour promoting character. The mechanisms that generate the diversity of outcomes of the ephrin/Eph pathway are largely unknown. We will use DNA origami/ephrin ligand nanoclusters to investigate whether the spatial organization and mechanical properties of ephrin ligand assemblies impact Eph receptor function and contribute to generating diversity in the pathway.

In turn, mechanical forces can also feedback on the molecular network to govern development. Several mechanosensitive proteins have been identified in animals but their role in multicellular development remains poorly documented. Plants are ideal systems to study mechanotransduction in development because their mechanics is mainly mediated by the cell wall. Here we propose to identify the plant mechanotransduction pathways and investigate their role in development, using Arabidopsis cell culture, cotyledons and shoot apical meristems as experimental systems.

We will conduct a multiscale investigation into mechanotransduction, at the level of a cell, of a small group of cells, and of the tissue. We have already characterized the response of microtubules to mechanical stress using a set of micromechanical tools in these three systems, and we have identified a mechanosensing protein, which, when impaired, causes growth coordination defects in the epidermis and altered morphogenesis. We will identify and characterize other elements of the plant mechanotransduction pathways, including mechanosensitive genes and proteins, based on preliminary results and on a well-designed screen. Scaling up, we will generate transgenic lines in which patches of cells with altered mechanical properties can be induced, and we will test whether mechanical heterogeneities are used to coordinate cell wall remodeling and cell division in neighboring cells. Last, we will investigate whether these biophysical coordinating mechanisms contribute to patterning and cell fate in organs, focusing on the epidermis, the boundaries between expression domains, and stem cell identity. We will investigate whether mutants exhibiting identity defects can be rescued with applied mechanical forces or locally modified mechanical properties.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,869,823</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Micro-RIP"><Rcn>185578</Rcn><Nid>12336</Nid><HI>Jyvaskylan Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Functional analysis of uncultivated microbes using radioisotope probing</Name><PI>Marja Tiirola</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Environmental microbiology calls for more advanced research methods for resolving microbial functions and regulation in environmental samples.

Hybridization of experimentally labeled RNA and radioactivity measurement would provide a second dimension for the sequencing analysis, facilitating various new applications in environmental microbiology, as well as potential applications for different needs of biochemistry and medical research.
The project aims to develop and test three novel RIP applications to analyse functional diversity, transcriptional regulation and mRNA processing in microbial communities, especially focusing on prokaryotic species. The applications are utilized for studying regulation of microbial decomposition, which is the key question, when predicting the effects of climate change. It is hypothesized that more frequent flood, droughts and redox fluctuations can prime the biodegradation of otherwise stable boreal carbon pools.
Functional diversity of microbes utilizing model and complex substrates is studied in terrestrial and aquatic environments using time-series samplings and labeling experiments.

A great challenge in medical mycology is to understand how fungal virulence evolves. The vast majority of fungal species are not human pathogens and, for those that are, virulence appears to have evolved independently on many different occasions.  Identifying the step(s) that convert an environmental fungus into a human pathogen, as well as subsequent changes in virulence within a pathogenic lineage, is therefore of fundamental importance.  Based on a number of lines of evidence, I hypothesise that a critical regulator of fungal virulence in animal hosts is the activity of the fungal mitochondrion, an energy-generating organelle present in almost all eukaryotes.  I propose to test this hypothesis comprehensively by combining genetic and cell biological approaches with high-resolution imaging methods.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,991,629</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MitoShape"><Rcn>188679</Rcn><Nid>12215</Nid><HI>Max-Delbruck-Centrum Fur Molekulare Medizin In Der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, Germany</HI><Name>Structural basis of mitochondrial inner membrane shape and dynamic</Name><PI>Oliver Daumke</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Here, I propose to study the structure and mechanisms of the cellular machineries mediating the shape and dynamics of the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM). The mitochondrial IM contains membrane invaginations called cristae. These are connected by tubular openings, the crista junctions, to the remaining IM. Mitochondrial shape constantly changes due to membrane fission and fusion events, and a balance of both processes is required for proper functioning of mitochondria. Abnormal mitochondrial shape and altered dynamics are associated with severe diseases, such as cancer and neurodegeneration.
Sourcing my group&#226;&#128;&#153;s expertise in dynamin superfamily GTPases, I wish to understand the molecular mechanisms of how OPA1 can achieve mitochondrial IM fusion and cristae formation. To this end, the X-ray crystallographic structure of OPA1 will be determined and complemented by a comprehensive biochemical characterization. Cell-based assays will be employed to decipher the exact mechanism by which OPA1 carries out its two functions and how specific mutations in OPA1 disturb these processes and, thereby, induce human disease.
The multiprotein MINOS complex was recently shown to be involved in the formation of crista junctions. I propose to explore the architecture of the MINOS complex. To this end, X-ray crystallographic structures of single components, subcomplexes and, eventually, the complete complex will be determined. Based on these structures, the mechanism of MINOS in mitochondrial membrane remodeling and crista junction formation will be dissected using a structure-based mutagenesis approach.
Components of MINOS were shown to interact with OPA1 and with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The interactions of MINOS with OPA1 and SAM will be biochemically mapped and structurally characterized. To understand their functions, the effect of disrupting mutations on crista junction formation and mitochondrial dynamics will be explored.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,972</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MoMAAV"><Rcn>189846</Rcn><Nid>11807</Nid><HI>Universite Pierre Et Marie Curie - Paris 6, France</HI><Name>Molecular signatures and Modulation of immunity to Adeno-Associated Virus vectors</Name><PI>Federico Mingozzi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Experience with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer in human trials has unveiled the therapeutic potential of this approach, with some of the most exciting results coming from clinical studies of gene transfer for hemophilia B, congenital blindness, and the recent market approval of the first AAV-based gene therapy in Europe. Follow-up data of subjects treated with AAV vectors is showing sustained correction of the disease phenotype for several years after gene transfer, and recent data confirmed that AAV vectors can drive expression of a transgene in humans for &gt;10 years. With clinical development, however, some of the limitations of the approach, not entirely identified in preclinical studies, became obvious; in particular it is well established that the host immune system represents an important obstacle to be overcome in terms of both safety and efficacy of gene transfer in vivo with AAV vectors. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain critical, missing knowledge on the interactions between AAV vectors and the immune system in order to develop strategies to achieve safe, effective, and long-lasting gene transfer in humans.
In this proposal we will: 1) Define the molecular signatures of the immune system in humans undergoing gene transfer with AAV vectors using cutting-edge, high-content immunophenotyping technologies; 2) Study the role of anti-AAV antibodies as determinants of AAV capsid immunogenicity using both in vitro and in vivo systems; 3) Identify novel pharmacological and cellular approaches to overcome T cell immunity to AAV; 4) Develop novel strategies to overcome pre-existing antibody responses to AAV.
This proposal exploits the knowledge and the skills available in our lab to develop new tools and to provide novel, basic insights into the human immune responses to AAV that will have a direct impact on the quality of life of patients affected by inherited disorders.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,730,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MultiPOC"><Rcn>185592</Rcn><Nid>12005</Nid><HI>Kungliga Tekniska Hoegskolan, Sweden</HI><Name>Highly Multiplexed Affinity Proteomics for Point of Care Diagnostics</Name><PI>Helene Andersson Svahn</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The main objective is the development of highly multiplexed affinity proteomics tools for point of care diagnostics. Enabled by the world's largest resource of antibodies to human protein targets generated within the framework of the Human Protein Atlas program, the aim of this application is to develop new concepts in translational medical research to allow dramatic improvement in performance and accessibility of point of care tests in both high and low resource clinical settings in infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions and several cancers. To achieve the goal, developments will be made in 1) detection principles and sample preparation, 2) rapid and low cost protein microarrays assays and 3) novel amplification strategies. Strategies will be developed to for the first time enable highly multiplexed sandwich detection across the analytical range of the plasma proteome. Four different novel microarray formats amenable for point of care are presented that each will allow dramatically improved multiplexity and high performance. Different types of new multifunctional silica/gold nanoparticles exhibiting combinations of magnetic, fluorescent, electro-active, enzymatic and optical qualities that will allow deterministic actuation and multimodal detection options will be synthesized and applied for exquisite sensitivity and rapid detection. Following the technology development, developed assay systems will be implemented for full plasma proteome analysis and in the three clinical areas: infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions and cancers. Collaborations with clinical researchers in all the relevant fields have already been established. In theses clinical fields, a body of previous research efforts has shown that highly multiplexed plasma analysis may dramatically improve diagnostic accuracy, and it is here that the novel comprehensive point of care systems presented in this proposal may conceivably create the largest impact for patients and health care systems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Mycinhibinclinic"><Rcn>189847</Rcn><Nid>11806</Nid><HI>Fundacio Privada Institut D&#226;&#128;&#153;Investigacio Oncologica De Vall-Hebron, Spain</HI><Name>Pushing Myc inhibition towards the clinic</Name><PI>Laura Soucek</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Deregulation of the Myc oncogene promotes tumorigenesis in most if not all cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis. However, targeting Myc has long been considered impossible because of potential catastrophic side effects in normal tissues. Despite this general assumption, we showed that Myc inhibition displays extraordinary therapeutic benefit in various transgenic mouse models of cancer, and caused only mild, well-tolerated and reversible side effects in normal tissues. For these studies we have employed a dominant negative of Myc, called Omomyc, which we designed and validated, and that is able to inhibit Myc transactivation function both in vitro and in vivo. Omomyc has so far been utilized exclusively as gene therapy and served the purpose of pre-clinically validating the therapeutic impact of systemic Myc inhibition. In this proposal we intend to push such a therapeutic approach further towards the clinic, making use of
1. Omomyc-based Cell Penetrating Peptides (CPPs): a novel, state-of-the-art potential method for directly utilising Omomyc itself (or a similar peptide) as a drug;
2. A new generation of Myc inhibitory small molecules generated by our collaborators at the Roswell Park Cancer Center.

Anaphylaxis is thought to rely on mechanisms involving mast cells that bear allergen-specific IgE and that release histamine when encountering allergen. Clinical cases, however, report anaphylaxis in the absence of specific IgE or medical history of allergy. We reported that murine models of anaphylaxis rely on IgG, rather than on IgE, that enable neutrophils, monocytes and basophils, rather than mast cells, to release Platelet Activating Factor following engagement of their IgG receptors. Supporting these findings, allergen-specific IgG are found in anaphylactic patients, and we reported that anaphylaxis in mice expressing a human IgG receptor relies also on circulating myeloid cells.

We aim at unravelling the parameters that control anaphylaxis in a novel clinically-relevant model of drug-induced anaphylaxis, strengthened by human-based studies involved patients undergoing drug-induced anaphylaxis in collaboration with clinicians and, altogether, rethink the principles of anaphylaxis. Do allergen-specific IgG concur to anaphylaxis in humans? Do these IgG antibodies regulate IgE-induced reactions? Which IgG receptors are involved? In which tissue does the anaphylactic reaction start? Which cell type(s) are responsible? Among the mediators that are released, which ones are responsible for the shock? Can an anaphylactic reaction be stopped specifically for an allergen? We propose to address these questions by exploiting humanized mice we obtained and by establishing novel models, by visualizing anaphylactic reactions in real time in vivo, by dissecting the cascade of events leading to the shock. Finally, we aim at establishing the proof of concept of allergen capture/encapsulation and propose the first allergen-specific strategy for treating the life-threatening clinical situation that represents drug-induced anaphylaxis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,704</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEURALCHUNK"><Rcn>191295</Rcn><Nid>11894</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

Although basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in action chunking, little is known about how individual elements are concatenated into a behavioral unit at the neuronal level. Using a differential reinforcement procedure where mice learn to chunk rapid action sequences, we uncovered neuronal activity encoding entire sequences as single actions in basal ganglia circuits. Besides activity signaling sequence initiation (start), we found neurons with sustained or inhibited activity throughout the execution of an entire sequence. These findings clearly show that basal ganglia circuits display neural activity related to the execution of whole action sequences, rather than unitary elements. Neurons with start, sustained and inhibited sequence-related activity were observed throughout the basal ganglia, namely in the main input (striatum), and output (substantia nigra reticulata) nuclei of the basal ganglia. However, the basal ganglia have different cell types/subcircuits linking input to output, the so called direct ves. indirect  pathways. Furthermore, basal ganglia output projects to different target areas. Here we will 1) determine if these correlates of motor concatenation are differentially expressed in direct versus indirect basal ganglia pathways by optogenetic identification of cell types in the striatum and in vivo imaging, 2) test the necessity and sufficiency of these two pathways in action sequence initiation and performance, and 3) test if different basal ganglia output circuits express and mediate different aspects of action chunking.

Understanding function seems to be on relatively solid grounds at the periphery where both anatomy and physiology converge in a simplified manner. However, as one ascends higher into the central nervous system, anatomy and physiology become increasingly more complex and functions become difficult to study. To reveal function, we will take a structure/function approach that synergizes between anatomical, physiological and behavioral methods. Namely, we will study the physiology of identified neurons to a rich set of stimuli bearing different behavioural contingencies and in the context of their anatomical boundaries. Specifically, my proposal aims to uncover function and structure of the mouse auditory cortex. First, we will redefine local and distant functional architecture in the auditory cortex using novel tracing techniques. Second, we will test a specific hypothesis whereas individual cortical neurons are multifunctional and part of distinct but multiple sub-networks. Third, we will use novel genetic techniques to tag and manipulate distinct cortical processing streams that are active during natural behaviors and specific learning paradigms. These experiments will answer whether specific sub-networks are instructive, permissive or necessary for perception. Finally, we will study how single neurons and sub-networks change in face of perceptual learning. As a whole, the main premise of this grant is to set the stage for, and eventually crystallize the experimental means to tease out functional diversity of single neurons in complex anatomical networks. Charting these basic principles for single neurons will impact how we study neuronal function and plasticity not only in the auditory system but across the mammalian brain."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NImO"><Rcn>191233</Rcn><Nid>11903</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Neural and Immune Orchestrators of Forebrain Wiring</Name><PI>Sonia No&#195;&#169;mie Garel</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Forebrain functioning relies on complex circuits that begin to be established in the embryo by intrinsic developmental programs. Such programs coordinate the assembly of millions of neurons via an integrated choreography of neuronal migration and axonal navigation, which remains largely to be explored. In addition, intrinsic programs can be modulated by maternal environment, as illustrated by the fact that prenatal inflammation is a major risk factor for schizophrenia and autism. Understanding how embryonic programs and maternal signals control forebrain wiring is essential not only to progress in our comprehension of cerebral morphogenesis but also to provide a framework for assessing the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.
We have shown that two cell populations, corridor neurons and more recently microglia, act by their specific positioning and properties as orchestrators of forebrain wiring. Migrating corridor neurons regulate the ordering of thalamocortical axons, a main input to the neocortex. Microglia, the resident brain macrophages that are activated by prenatal inflammation, specifically regulate the progression of cortical and dopaminergic axons and the positioning of migrating cortical interneurons. Our work not only reveals the complex interactions governing forebrain wiring, but also a remarkable interplay in the development of the neural and immune systems. We now aim at deciphering the roles of these neural and immune cells during embryonic wiring of the forebrain. By multi-disciplinary approaches in mice we will investigate: i) how corridor neurons govern the ordering of thalamic axons; ii) how microglia regulate axonal progression and neuronal migration; iii) how microglia depletion or prenatal activation impacts in the long-term on forebrain functions. This ambitious project will provide essential knowledge on the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing forebrain wiring during normal and pathological development.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,994,659</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NO-DISEASE"><Rcn>185541</Rcn><Nid>13170</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Developing novel therapies for systemic disorders by regulating Nitric Oxide (NO) substrates' availability</Name><PI>Ayelet Erez</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential signalling molecule for diverse physiological and disease processes.  The current paradigm of how NO production is regulated focuses at the level of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), with respect to substrate and co-factor availability and the precise spatial and temporal arrangement of protein complexes.  However, the respective unique or combined genetic deficiencies of the NOS isoforms exhibit relatively modest phenotypes in mice.  Moreover, approaches targeted at modulating NOS activities have not successfully translated into different disease applications.  All NOS isoforms are dependent on arginine as their sole substrate and interestingly, only one enzyme in mammals argininosuccinic lyase (ASL), can generate endogenous arginine. We propose that global regulation of NO production occurs earlier at the step of regulating arginine substrate availability within the cell.  Until now, regulation at the level of arginine availability has been under-appreciated since arginine is readily available from external and dietary sources, irrespective of endogenous cellular production.  However, extracellular arginine levels can affect NO production even though the intracellular levels of arginine are saturated.
In humans, the natural history of argininosuccinic aciduria caused by deficiency of ASL shows systemic and chronic features that reflect in part global dysregulation of NO homeostasis.  This led us to discover that ASL is required for the channelling of both endogenously synthesized arginine and exogenous arginine to NOS.   By challenging the existing paradigm, I hypothesize that regulating ASL would allow us to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NO flux regulation at normal and pathological conditions, for therapeutic applications. This proposal is hence novel both in its concept but also in its approach that is based on targeting therapy for systemic disorders through regulating cellular metabolism.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,915,555</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuroKinematics"><Rcn>188674</Rcn><Nid>12222</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Neuronal Dynamics of the Basal Ganglia and the Kinematics of Motor Habits</Name><PI>David Robbe</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Motor habits are well learned spatiotemporally ordered sequences of movements executed without being explicitly motivated by a goal. Habits are formed following long trial-and-error learning periods but once acquired they tend to persist even when their beneficial outcome is degraded. Despite the behavioral importance of habits and their dramatic alteration in several pathologies (Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome, addictions) the neuronal mechanisms behind habitual actions are unclear. On the one hand, lesions or dysfunction of the basal ganglia (BG) are well known to alter the formation and execution of habits. On the other hand, it is generally assumed that the function of the BG is to initiate adapted actions while inhibiting unwanted ones. This action selection model implies that the BG does not contribute to the control of the kinematics of actions (how selected actions are executed). A major problem of the action selection model is that it does not explain why BG dysfunctions result in specific deficits in movement kinematics.

Here, on the basis of recent findings from our team, we will test the hypothesis that, rather than selecting actions, neuronal activity in the BG plays a crucial role in controlling the kinematics of habitual actions. We will combine large-scale recordings of spiking activity in the BG (striatum) and related structures (primary motor cortex and thalamus) with optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations of neuronal activity in behaving rodents. Importantly we will use new behavioral tasks specifically designed to capture the often overlooked spatiotemporal structure of habits. The results obtained will shed new lights on the network and cellular mechanisms driving habits, the controversial function of the BG and the broader issue of motor learning. A better understanding of these topics is a required step toward improving the treatment of the numerous diseases of the BG, including those impairing habits.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,846,073</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuroMT"><Rcn>189837</Rcn><Nid>10802</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Building the Neuronal Microtubule Cytoskeleton</Name><PI>Casper Cassander Hoogenraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Microtubules (MTs) are one of the major cytoskeletal components of the cell, essential for many fundamental cellular and developmental processes, such as cell division, motility and polarity. In large and highly polarized cells like neurons, MTs have been regarded as essential structures for stable neuronal morphology and serve as tracks for long-distance transport; however, fundamental new insights into the role of neural MTs have emerged. New findings demonstrate that the MT cytoskeleton plays an active role during different phases of neuronal development: MTs determine axon formation, control polarized cargo trafficking, and regulate the dynamics of dendritic spines, the major sites of excitatory synaptic input. Failures in MT function have been linked to various neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and recent studies highlight MTs as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
How neuronal MTs are formed and stabilized during neuronal polarity and differentiation is largely unknown, and whether this requires the centrosome is under debate. The overall aim of this proposal is to investigate basic mechanisms responsible for organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton during neuronal development. Here, we will take a multidisciplinary approach and combine biochemistry, neurobiology, molecular engineering, and advanced microscopy to study the role of MTs at three stages of neuronal differentiation. We propose to determine: i) the role of (non-)centrosomal MT nucleation during early development, ii) the mechanism by which dendrites organize MTs into anti-parallel arrays, iii) the relation between MTs spine entry and cargo transport in mature neurons. We anticipate that these studies will uncover how the MT cytoskeleton is built and organized at different phases of neuronal development, which will be relevant for understanding polarized transport, synaptic processes and associated neurodegenerative disorders.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuroMolAnatomy"><Rcn>192402</Rcn><Nid>13472</Nid><HI>Universitaetsmedizin Goettingen - Georg-August-Universitaet Goettingen - Stiftung Oeffentlichen Rechts, Germany</HI><Name>The Molecular Anatomy of Neurons</Name><PI>Silvio Olivier Rizzoli</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The brain is nowadays the object of a number of extensive systematic studies that focus on seemingly all aspects of its morphology and function, from overall brain architecture to neuronal connections, neuronal morphology and gene expression. However, at least one basic aspect is as yet incompletely studied: the molecular anatomy of the neuron, i.e., the copy numbers and the spatial arrangement of molecules within the neuronal cell. This cannot be addressed by gene expression or proteomics approaches, as they do not have sufficient spatial precision. Electron microscopy, ideal for unraveling the neuronal morphology, does not have sufficient protein labeling efficiency. My project aims to fill this gap by a combination of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, advanced fluorescence labelling techniques and advanced biochemistry tools such as quantitative mass spectometry. My objectives are fourfold: 1) to determine the molecular organization of at least 200 major neuronal proteins: their exact copy numbers and their position within the cell determined with nanoscale precision; 2) to generate a bank of biochemistry and microscopy sample preparations that will be available world-wide for the characterization of 1000-2000 additional proteins; 3) to integrate results into an in silico neuronal model that can be used for modelling functional neuronal parameters; 4) to use this technology to determine the changes in neuronal anatomy caused by neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s and Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s Diseases.

In order to uncover how different regions of the neocortex process sensory information, it is necessary to understand how the pattern and properties of synaptic connections in a specific sensory circuit determine the computations it performs. I propose to establish the relationship between synaptic connectivity and neuronal function in primary visual cortex (V1) with the aim of revealing circuit-level mechanisms of sensory processing. To this end, my laboratory has developed a new method, by which visual response properties of neurons are first characterised with two-photon calcium imaging in vivo, and then synaptic connections between a subset of these neurons are assayed with multiple whole-cell recordings in slices of the same tissue. We will use this method to determine how connectivity, synaptic and intrinsic properties of different excitatory and inhibitory cell types relate to the emergence of their visual receptive fields (RFs). Specifically, we will test the dependence of connections on RF position, structure and other visual response properties, the specificity of connections between simple and complex cells, and the relative contribution of feedforward and recurrent excitation and inhibition towards shaping RFs.

Phenotypic evolution is thought to be largely founded on developmental gene regulatory changes, which determine species-specific tissue morphologies and thus lay the foundation for their typical physiological properties. We recently performed the first cross-mammalian transcriptome comparisons for adult organs, providing many insights into the molecular evolution of organ physiologies, but the evolution of developmental transcriptomes remains largely unstudied. I propose to generate comprehensive RNA sequencing data for a collection of adult tissues and developmental precursors from many mammals and tetrapod outgroup species (birds, reptiles, amphibians). The data will include dense ontogenetic time courses for key reference species, covering embryonic stages and, for mammals, placental tissues. We will identify coding and noncoding genes constituting core ancestral tissue transcriptomes and assess relative contributions of gene expression changes and the emergence of new genes to the evolution of phenotypically relevant expression patterns. We will also empirically evaluate global models of evolutionary conservation patterns during embryogenesis and placentation. To understand the dynamics of functional and regulatory interactions of different gene types and their evolutionary relevance, we will reconstruct evolutionary transcription networks and assess associated regulatory mechanisms. Overall, this inter-disciplinary &#226;&#128;&#156;evo-devo&#226;&#128;&#157; project will unveil ontogenetic and adult gene expression programs underlying shared (ancestral) and lineage-specific morphological and physiological phenotypes.

The project will apply design and selection strategies aiming at nucleic acid molecules that can be controlled by irradiation with light and which we have developed in preliminary studies. This will now be taken significant steps forward by generating modular allosteric ribonucleic acid (RNA) assemblies that respond to light. These assemblies provide a generic solution and represent long-sought methods to complement the optogenetic toolbox. The aim of this project is the generation of allosteric molecules built from at least two RNA domains; one domain that binds to a soluble photoreceptor protein (PRP) in a light-dependent manner and a second RNA domain, whose protein inhibiting function in turn depends on the binding state of the PRP-recognizing part. We will construct light-responsive allosteric RNA assemblies that can be ubiquitously used in cells and in vivo, independent of specific model organisms, for optogenetic control and spatiotemporal analysis of endogenous, intracellular biomolecule function. The project is highly interdisciplinary and will open novel routes for biomolecule analysis in cells and in vivo. It has implications ranging from life sciences to optogenetics, and from combinatorial biochemistry to synthetic biology. As these new tools will be applicable by any scientist to analyse protein function at high spatiotemporal resolution, the project bears an enormous innovative potential.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PANDA"><Rcn>189825</Rcn><Nid>11820</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Phylogenetic ANalysis of Diversification Across the tree of life</Name><PI>H&#195;&#169;l&#195;&#168;ne Morlon</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Explaining the tremendous disparity in the number of species among different taxonomic groups and geographic regions is one of the greatest challenges in biodiversity research.  This project aims to significantly advance our fundamental understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that explain how species richness is distributed on earth and in the tree of life. The first part of the project consists in significantly improving phylogenetic approaches to diversification. This implies developing stochastic lineage-based birth-death models that account for species interactions, stochastic lineage-based birth-death models integrating phylogenetic and fossil information, and stochastic individual-based birth-death-speciation models. The second part of the project consists in implementing these models, as well as other recently developed models, in efficient and user-friendly software packages. Finally, the third part of the project consists in applying these phylogenetic tools to large datasets spanning the tree of life in order to understand how and why speciation and extinction rates vary over evolutionary time, geographical space, and species groups. We will use our new phylogenetic comparative methods to uncover diversity-through-time curves for a wide variety of taxonomic groups, evaluate the relative role of the biotic and the abiotic environment in driving diversification, shed new light on the latitudinal diversity gradient, and consider microbial diversity with a macroevolutionary perspective.

Climate warming, atmospheric deposition of acidifying and eutrophying pollutants and land-use change are three of the most important threats to biodiversity in temperate forests. However, most studies focused on the effects of single factors over short time periods, such that our ability to predict the combined effects of multiple global change drivers over longer time periods remains rudimentary. The lack of knowledge on effects of global change drivers on forest herb layer communities is particularly striking, since the herb layer contains the largest part of vascular plant diversity in temperate forests and provides key ecosystem services. Therefore PASTFORWARD will build an integrative understanding of the interactive effects of land-use change, atmospheric deposition and climate warming on forest herb layer communities, starting from the insight that changes in herb layer communities are driven primarily by past land use, but can be modulated by atmospheric deposition, climate warming and forest management. Indeed, it is still largely ignored that sensible predictions of herb layer development trajectories under global change can only be made by taking the forest&#226;&#128;&#153;s land-use history into account, as legacies of past land use can leave century-long imprints on forest herb layer communities. Three complementary data sources (a database with resurveyed vegetation plots, field measurements in a pan-European network of resurvey plots, and a multi-factor experiment) combined with an ecosystem model will be used. Furthermore, concepts and tools from different disciplines, ranging from history over sylviculture to community and ecosystem ecology will be applied. The results of PASTFORWARD will help forest managers and policy makers in taking more informed decisions on how to combine resource extraction with biodiversity conservation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,887,780</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PATHPHYLODYN"><Rcn>185560</Rcn><Nid>11373</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Pathogen Phylodynamics: Unifying Evolution, Infection and Immunity"</Name><PI>Oliver Pybus</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Genetic sequences represent a rich source of information about evolutionary and ecological processes in natural populations. However the development of methods to recover this information is being outpaced by the explosion in sequence data, especially since the introduction of &#226;&#128;&#152;next-generation&#226;&#128;&#153; sequencing. This problem is particularly acute for the inter-disciplinary field of pathogen phylodynamics. The rapid evolution of many pathogens means their ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur on the same timescale and therefore new analytical methods are required to study this joint behaviour. Further, the small genome sizes and medical importance of many viruses mean that hundreds of thousands of homologous sequences are already available, and sample sizes will continue to grow. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply multiple new frameworks of evolutionary analysis, to unlock the full potential of current data and to exploit new types of sequence data for which no rigorous analytical methods currently exist. Across four related themes I will use these novel methods to answer major unsolved questions about the evolutionary dynamics of viruses and their hosts: (i) How can we measure adaptation in data sets comprising many thousands of genomes? (ii) Can we reveal the adaptation of viral lineages to the genetic variation in immunity present in host populations? (iii) How can we combine mathematical ecological models with viral genomics to better predict the outcome of chronic HIV and hepatitis C virus infection, or the success of anti-viral drug therapy? (iv) Can we apply methods from ecology and evolution to analyse new data on immune receptor diversity, and use them to better understand the dynamics of leukaemia and viral infection?

For different reasons, much less attention has been given to the process of change within the somatic line of a multicellular individual. The formation of cancer tumors due to uncontrolled cell proliferation is one of the most prominent forms of somatic evolution. The evolution of cancer tumors in a body can be likened with the evolution of populations in more or less fragmented habitats. The tumor is usually a expanding population of clonal cells, which may differentiate to a bigger or lesser extent (population structure) and disperse to contiguous (range expansion) or more distant tissues (long distance colonization). During tumor progression, this population of cells is subject to distinct somatic evolutionary processes like mutation, drift, selection or migration, which can act at different points in time and geographical space. Very recently, the discovery of extensive intratumor heterogeneity, together with the rise of single cell genomics, has created an unique opportunity to study the phylogeography of cancer tumor cells. So far evolutionary inferences drawn from cancer genomes have been mostly qualitative. Here we propose to study a thousand single cell genomes from different regions in primary tumors and matched metastases. We will develop and apply state-of-the-art statistical and computational techniques from phylogenetics, phylogeography and population genomics to understand the tempo and mode of evolution of cell lineages within and between cancer tumors. By doing so we aim to construct a robust theoretical and methodological evolutionary framework that can contribute to a better understanding of the process of somatic evolution and shed light into the biology of cancer."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="POLLOX"><Rcn>185636</Rcn><Nid>11994</Nid><HI>Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen Deutsches Forschungszentrum Fuer Gesundheit Und Umwelt Gmbh, Germany</HI><Name>ANAEROBIC POLLUTANT DEGRADATION WITH OXYGEN</Name><PI>Tillmann Joachim L&#195;&#188;ders</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Contamination with organic pollutants is widespread in nature and a notorious threat to our water resources. Two central paradigms are currently understood to control biodegradation in groundwater and sediments: (i) Redox gradients and interphases between compartments are hot-spots for contaminant breakdown, and (ii) biodegradation is primarily limited by local electron acceptor availability, in particular of oxygen. My group has published leading contributions to this understanding in recent years, especially in elucidating the ecology of anaerobic toluene degraders in aquifers.
This project now aims to question these established paradigms and to elaborate a ground-breaking new perspective of the role of molecular oxygen in pollutant degradation in anoxic compartments. The hypotheses at the heart of the project originate from a combination of own recent findings, partially inconsistent with the current understanding of process and degrader stratification at redox gradients. These are now interpreted in the light of exciting recent advances in the fields of electromicrobiology and oxygenic anaerobic respiration.
POLLOX postulates that oxygen-dependent degradation of pollutants in anaerobic compartments is possible by two unrecognised physiological adaptations of degraders. I want to verify the hypothesis that filamentous Desulfobulbaceae can anaerobically oxidise toluene via long-distance (1-2 cm) electron transfer to oxygen across redox gradients (aim 1). Furthermore, I postulate that monooxygenase-dependent toluene degraders, in absence of external oxygen, can be active via self-sustained production of oxygen by nitric oxide dismutation (aim 2). POLLOX proposes to perform targeted lab experiments and field surveys to verify both hypotheses and to elaborate the ecological niches in which respective degraders and processes are relevant in situ (aim 3). The generic mechanisms to be elaborated here have the potential to open new doors for bioremediation in the future."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,888,920</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PREMETAZOANEVOLUTION"><Rcn>185646</Rcn><Nid>12321</Nid><HI>Universidad Pompeu Fabra, Spain</HI><Name>Unravelling the unicellular prehistory of metazoans with functional analyses and single-cell genomics</Name><PI>I&#195;&#177;aki Ruiz Trillo</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"How multicellular animals (metazoans) emerged from their single-celled ancestor remains a long-standing evolutionary question. Recent genome data has shown that the unicellular ancestor of metazoans already had a complex gene repertoire for genes involved in cell adhesion, cell signaling and transcriptional regulation, including integrins, cadherins, T-box genes, and protein tyrosine kinases. Thus, besides a few metazoan-specific genes, gene co-option and, probably, an increase in gene regulation played important roles into the origin of Metazoa. However, the lack of genetic tools among metazoan&#226;&#128;&#153;s closest relatives has so far precluded further investigations at the molecular level. Our recent establishment, for the first time, of transgenesis methodologies in two close unicellular relatives of metazoans (both the ichthyosporean Creolimax fragrantissima and the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki), allow us to approach these questions in ways that were not previously possible. Thus, we aim to push forward these two model systems and infer, by cell biology and functional genomics, the ancestral function of those genes key to multicellularity in order to understand how they were co-opted for new multicellular functions. In addition, we will analyze the regulation of the different cell stages and the colony formation (syncitial and aggregative multicellularity) in these two organism by functional genomics and identify when and how the metazoan histone code (an important regulatory layer of gene expression) evolved by analyzing the histone code in these taxa. Finally, to understand the ecology, distribution and adaptation of these unicellular taxa we will obtain the complete genome sequence of uncultured lineages by using single-cell genomics. This research will not only markedly improve our understanding of a major biological question (the origin of metazoan multicellularity) but will also generate new data relevant to a broad range of researchers."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,967,535</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PROTEODYNAMICS"><Rcn>189829</Rcn><Nid>10613</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zu Koeln, Germany</HI><Name>Global Dynamics of Proteolytic Quality Control Networks in Stress Response and Aging</Name><PI>Thorsten Hoppe</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Accumulation of damaged and aggregated proteins is associated with age-related neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s and Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s patients. The ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is a major proteolytic route functioning in a cellular network that maintains the proteome during stress and aging. Degradation of damaged proteins is mediated by the 26S proteasome upon attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) proteins (ubiquitylation). Another proteolytic system supporting protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is the autophagy-lysosome pathway that degrades proteins inside activated autophagosomes. An age-related impairment of either of these systems causes enhanced protein aggregation and affects lifespan, suggesting functional overlap and cooperation between UPS and autophagy in stress and aging. Despite the progress made in searching for key substrates that are destined for degradation, the major challenge in the field is to understand how these proteolytic systems are mechanistically coordinated to overcome age-related proteotoxicity. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to assemble a global picture of stress-induced proteolytic networks critical for aging of multicellular organisms. The tissue-specific regulation of protein degradation pathways will be addressed using the powerful genetic model of Caenorhabditis elegans. The suggested project will systematically analyze: inducible protein degradation pathways (Aim 1), the regulation of UPS and autophagy by microRNAs (miRNAs) (Aim 2), and tissue-specific adaptation of proteolytic networks (Aim 3) in stress response and aging. To this end, comprehensive transcriptome analysis, large-scale genetic screenings combined with deep-sequencing technology, and candidate approaches based on in vivo imaging and degradation assays will be performed. Together, we propose a highly complementary research plan that aims to break new grounds in the understanding of proteolytic networks in aging and disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PROduCTS"><Rcn>188652</Rcn><Nid>12208</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Anstalt Fuer Wasserversorgung Abwasserreinigung Und Gewaesserschutz, Switzerland</HI><Name>Predicting environment-specific biotransformation of chemical contaminants</Name><PI>Kathrin Barbara Fenner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The ability to predict rates and products of microbial biotransformation for a broad variety of chemical contaminants accurately is essential not only for chemical risk management but also in the context of contaminated site remediation or the development of green chemical alternatives. Existing prediction methods, however, fall short of fulfilling these needs mostly because they base predictions on chemical structure only, disregarding the microbial communities responsible for degradation and their actual metabolic potential as shaped by environmental conditions. The long-term goals of the proposed research are to develop the scientific basis and appropriate modeling algorithms for considering the metabolic potential of environmental microbial communities (i.e., the available pools of catalytic enzymes) in biotransformation prediction. It is proposed that enzyme-catalyzed biotransformation reactions are established as the explicit core elements of biotransformation prediction. The reactions so defined will serve as mechanistic basis to (i) experimentally explore the linkage between microbial community gene expression profiles and their observed potential for contaminant biotransformation, and (ii) use chemometrics and pattern analysis in high-dimensional space to mine environment-specific chemical biotransformation data for probabilities of biotransformation reactions. The resulting novel algorithms for the environment-specific prediction of biotransformation rates and products will be implemented into an existing, publically-accessible biotransformation prediction system (http://www.umbbd.ethz.ch/predict). The proposed research is highly interdisciplinary and will profit from the most recent technological and scientific advances in the fields of analytical chemistry, molecular biology and chemo-/bioinformatics to develop a ground-breaking approach for profiling the capacity of microbial communities for contaminant biotransformation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,352</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PS3"><Rcn>188663</Rcn><Nid>10639</Nid><HI>Migal Galilee Research Institute Ltd, Israel</HI><Name>An artificial water-soluble photosystem by protein design</Name><PI>Dror Noy</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project aims at producing a fully functional light energy conversion system that is inspired by, but does not necessarily mimic, the fundamental solar energy conversion unit of natural photosynthesis &#226;&#128;&#147; the photosystem.

Here, this knowledge and capabilities will be further developed and utilized for the design and construction of multi-cofactor, multi-subunit protein complexes with photosystem functionality. These will be designed to efficiently capture light in the visible and near infrared range, exploit it for driving the oxidation of a molecular redox carrier at one end, and providing highly reducing electrons at the other end.

Constructing protein scaffolds that will assemble and organize arrays of multiple pigments, and chains of redox cofactors are significant challenges at the forefront of the field of protein de novo design, and current theories of biological energy and electron transfer.
Success will set a new standard, well beyond the current state of the art, for our ability to use computational protein design methods for assembling functional protein-cofactor complexes.  These can be used as benchmarks to test and validate the engineering principles of biological energy conversion systems, as well as new ideas about their evolution.

Proteins are typically joined by reversible or non-specific linkages. We have designed a unique way to connect protein building blocks irreversibly and precisely, via spontaneous isopeptide bond formation. This involves modifying proteins with a short peptide tag (SpyTag) that is based upon remarkable chemistry used by pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. Here we will develop this novel approach to address major challenges in synthetic biology. We will engineer SpyTag capture towards infinite affinity (defined as diffusion-limited on-rate and no off-rate), to transform the sensitivity of peptide detection in living systems. We will also apply SpyTag to create a new generation of protein polymers, irreversibly assembled with molecular precision and tailored branching. In parallel we will harness SpyTag to enhance circulating tumor cell (CTC) capture, one of the most promising ways to achieve early cancer diagnosis. In capturing CTCs and other rare cells from blood, the high forces mean that even the strongest non-covalent linkages fail. SpyTag covalent bridging, in concert with super-resolution live cell fluorescence microscopy, will give us the opportunity to answer key questions about the forces and membrane dynamics at the magnetic bead:cell synapse. We will exploit these insights and SpyTag-assembled antibody polymers to dramatically reduce the threshold of antigen expression for CTC capture.

Nuclear positioning depends on connections between nuclear envelope proteins and the cytoskeleton. In migrating cells, we found that the nucleus is positioned away from the front of the cell and this event is important for cell migration. We performed an RNAi screen for nuclear positioning and found new nuclear envelope proteins involved in nuclear positioning. In fully developed myofibers, nuclei are specifically positioned at the periphery of the myofiber, while during development and regeneration, as well as in multiple muscle pathologies, the nucleus is centrally positioned. We found new mechanisms drive nuclear movement during myofiber formation. We also showed that nuclear position is important for muscle function. However why nuclear positioning is important for myofiber activity remains an open question.

We now propose to use unique systems to monitor cell migration and myofiber formation in combination with biochemistry, cell biology, high- and super-resolution microscopy approaches to:

1) Identify novel molecular mechanisms that mediate nuclear positioning during cell migration and myofiber formation.

3) Determine a role for nuclear positioning in myofiber function as well as the significance of altered nuclear positioning in different forms of muscle pathology.

The proposed work will establish new mechanisms for nuclear positioning. Importantly, by identifying mechanisms and understanding the role of nuclear positioning in myofiber function, we will lay the foundations for future studies to ameliorate or treat muscle disorders as well as other conditions where nucleus positioning may prove to play a role such as cancer.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,968,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PolyDorm"><Rcn>185659</Rcn><Nid>12317</Nid><HI>Tel Aviv University, Israel</HI><Name>Uncovering the molecular and cellular mechanism of tumor dormancy for the rational design of theranostic nanomedicines</Name><PI>Ronit Satchi-Fainaro</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS7, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Tumor progression is dependent on a number of sequential steps, including initial tumor-vascular interactions and recruitment of blood vessels, as well as an established interaction of tumor cells with their surrounding microenvironment. Failure of a microscopic tumor, either primary, recurrent or metastatic, to complete one or more of these early stages may lead to delayed clinical manifestation of the cancer and a state of stable non-progressing disease. Micrometastasis, dormant tumors, and residual tumor cells contribute to the occurrence of relapse, and constitute fundamental clinical manifestations of tumor dormancy that together are responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths. However, although the tumor dormancy phenomenon has critical implications for early detection and treatment of cancer, its biology and genetic characteristics are poorly understood. We now propose to investigate the molecular and cellular changes in tumor-host interactions that govern tumor dormancy, which may lead to the discovery of novel tumor dormancy targets and provide tools for dormancy-dependent tumor therapy strategies. In order to achieve this goal, we will integrate the following basic and translational approaches: (i) Establishment of mouse models of dormant and fast-growing tumor pairs; (ii) Functional and molecular characterization of dormant versus fast-growing tumors, (iii) Design of dormancy-promoting tailor-made polymer therapeutics delivering a combination of microRNAs with chemotherapies; (iv) Polymer conjugation to a prodrug designed to be activated by specific enzymes overexpressed in tumors, Turning-ON a near infra-red (NIR) fluorescence signal.
When completed, this proposal will shed light on this fundamental cancer biology phenomenon.

Recent estimates indicate that the overall number of people with visual loss is 285 million globally, of whom 39 million are blind. In Europe, approximately 1 in 30 individuals experience sight loss and 75% of those are unemployed, a social burden which is anticipated to double by 2020 as the population of Europe ages. Diseases affecting the retina, the light sensitive extension of the central nervous system lining the back of the eye, account for approximately 26% of blindness. To date, there are no treatments to restore lost retinal cells and visual function and there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. A pioneering breakthrough has highlighted the possibility of generating synthetic retinae from stem cells under laboratory conditions. This research is in its infancy and needs to be developed so human synthetic retinae can be produced efficiently and reproducibly from patient-specific stem cells. Very recently, my group has developed a unique method that results in conversion of human embryonic stem cells to fully laminated retinae containing all retinal cell types under laboratory conditions. In this project we aim: (1) to develop a robust differentiation method for generation of synthetic retinae that can be applied efficiently to a large number of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells; (2) to  investigate that laboratory derived synthetic retinae contain functional retinal cells which are equivalent to native cells arising during human development and can contribute to restoration of vision upon transplantation into degenerate retinae and (3) to develop preclinical tools that will enable us to select functional retinal cells for cell replacement therapies in humans.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,599,857</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RNAiMMUNITY"><Rcn>192002</Rcn><Nid>10714</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Dynamics of the RNAi-mediated antiviral immunity</Name><PI>Maria Carla Saleh Bottegoni</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific, gene-silencing mechanism that is induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Double-stranded RNA is commonly generated during viral replication and is considered to be a molecular pattern associated with viral infection. Our previous work demonstrated that viral infections in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are countered by an antiviral RNAi response: the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway is the major antiviral defence mechanism in insects. Recently, another RNAi pathway was also suggested to be involved in antiviral defence, the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway.
The field of insect immunity has been largely dominated by studies on antimicrobial immunity, while antiviral immunity has received relatively little attention. Based on a combination of basic and applied science as well as bioinformatic approaches, we propose to investigate the molecular and cellular aspects underlying the immune dynamics of the antiviral response. We want to uncover fully the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in insects and its main attributes, such as memory, long-lasting immunity, specificity, and effect on the virus.

While there is ample evidence from model systems that small RNAs are the lynchpin of powerful mechanisms that silence transcription, the demonstration of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) mediated by a small RNA in humans is lacking. We have recently shown that the HIV-1 LTR is controlled by premature termination of transcription and TGS mediated by a small RNA derived from the stem-loop structure, TAR, that forms the 5&#226;&#128;&#153; end of HIV-1 transcripts. This pathway depends on Microprocessor, Xrn2, Setx and Rrp6. Cleavage of TAR by Microprocessor has major consequences 1) it provides a substrate for Rrp6, which generates a small RNA that represses HIV-1 transcription, 2) it creates an entry site for Xrn2 and termination factors that lead to premature termination of transcription. Loss of Microprocessor or Rrp6 leads to recruitment of RNAPII to the LTR and activation of transcription. These findings not only provide the first evidence showing that small RNA-mediated TGS acts in human cells, but they also uncovered a new mechanism of gene regulation involving premature termination of transcription by RNAPII. Several important questions now need to be answered. What is the mechanism underlying small RNA-mediated TGS? Does small RNA-mediated TGS operate at human genes? What is the contribution of TGS coupled to premature termination in the global control of transcription? We will use a battery of biochemical and molecular approaches to dissect the molecular mechanism of RNA-mediated TGS. The global importance of small RNA-mediated TGS and premature termination of transcription in the control of human gene expression will be addressed using complementary genome-wide approaches. RNA-mediated TGS coupled to premature termination, if confirmed as a widespread mechanism controlling transcription, will fundamentally change our perspective of transcriptional control in humans</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,974</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RSHEALTH"><Rcn>185676</Rcn><Nid>10722</Nid><HI>Fundacion Centro Nacional De Investigaciones Oncologicas Carlos Iii, Spain</HI><Name>Investigating the causes and consequences of replication stress in mammalian health</Name><PI>Oscar Fernandez-Capetillo Ruiz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA damage (DD) is the cause of several diseases, including cancer, and it is also linked to the organ decline that arises in ageing. Yet, the contribution of different sources of DD to these processes is not understood. Sources of DD such as chromosome breaks, eroded telomeres or oxidative stress are been heavily investigated. For establishing my group, I decided to focus on a source of DD that arises every time a cell replicates its DNA, and which is known as replication stress (RS). In short, RS stands for the excessive accumulation of single-stranded DNA at replication forks that, due to its recombinogenic nature, can initiate genomic rearrangements. Consistently, RS is now known to be a key source of genomic instability in human tumors. In mammalian cells, a signalling cascade initiated by ATR and Chk1 kinases suppresses RS. Unfortunately, the essential nature of these kinases significantly limited the study of the RS-response in mammals. In the initial years of our lab we have developed several tools that facilitate the study of RS in mammals. These include a cellular system where ATR can be activated at will, potent and selective ATR inhibitors, and mice with reduced or increased levels of ATR and Chk1 kinases. These tools have allowed us to start exploring how RS impacts on cancer and ageing, as well as to investigate the potential of targeting ATR for cancer therapy. Yet, the field of RS is still poorly developed, and many basic questions are still in the need of answers.

This application outlines a plan for our research in the next five years, and explains how I propose to investigate RS at molecular, cellular and animal levels. Whereas I plan to capitalize on the tools (published and unpublished) that we have generated within the last few years, I also propose several innovative strategies for the study of the RS-response in mammals. This grant would allow us to consolidate our still young group as a solid laboratory for the study of RS in mammals."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,819</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RariTOR"><Rcn>192573</Rcn><Nid>13443</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>mTOR pathophysiology in rare human diseases</Name><PI>Mario Pende</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of growth. mTOR is a protein kinase that exists in two distinct complexes in the cell and transduces virtually all anabolic signals from the environment: nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, growth factor peptides, such as insulin and insulin like growth factors, oxygen, mitochondrial metabolites, energy status. mTOR is required to sustain cell responses to nutrient availability including cell growth, proliferation, macromolecule biosynthesis, and suppress autophagy. During the past ten years we have generated and characterized a wide panel of mouse mutants in the mTOR pathway. We were involved in revealing specific phenotypes that increased our knowledge of mTOR roles in pathophysiology: mutants with small cells, mutants resistant to tumorigenesis in specific tissues and after specific oncogenic insults, mutants mimicking caloric restriction and promoting longevity, mutants with muscle dystrophy, mutants with altered insulin action.
The overall goal of our research proposal for the next five years is twofold. From one hand we want to better understand fundamental processes including cell size control and organismal longevity. To this end we want to determine the molecular targets of the mTORC1/S6 kinase cassette that may explain the alterations in cell size and lifespan when these kinases are deregulated (project 1). From the other hand we want to understand and cure rare human genetic diseases that arise from pathological changes in the activity of the mTOR pathway in children or that may benefit from therapeutical intervention on this pathway. These diseases include Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, PEComas and hemangiomas (project 2), metabolic diseases (projects 3), lysosomal storage diseases (project 4).

A failure to maintain the integrity of replicating chromosomes leads to genome instability, an early event in tumorigenesis. Most common anti-cancer drugs also interfere with DNA synthesis, by largely undefined mechanisms. My lab specializes in the structural and molecular characterization of DNA replication stress in higher eukaryotes, combining standard cell and molecular biology with specialized single molecule analysis of replication intermediates.

The first aim of our research is to gain mechanistic information about the elusive impact of oncogene activation on DNA replication. By direct structural analysis of tissue culture models of tumorigenesis, we have recently uncovered specific defects in DNA synthesis associated with DNA damage checkpoint activation. We plan to expand these studies to compare the effect of different oncogenes and to identify cellular factors modulating oncogene-induced genotoxicity.

We are also elucidating the cytotoxic mechanisms of anti-cancer drugs that challenge DNA replication. Comparing the molecular consequences of chemotherapeutic treatments in control cells and cells lacking cancer-related factors, we plan to uncover how precisely different drugs interfere with replication and which cellular players mediate their cytotoxicity. We plan to complement these studies with a proteomic-based screen, to identify novel factors modulating replication of a damaged template.

Finally, we plan to analyze replication features in different populations of stem cells, as the cellular response to replication stress was recently proven essential for stem cell maintenance. We aim to provide mechanistic insight into the constitutive activation of the DNA damage response reported in embryonic stem cells. We also plan to expand these investigations to hematopoietic stem cells, where we recently observed similar phenomena upon stimuli-induced proliferation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,846,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SASATIN"><Rcn>111576</Rcn><Nid>11824</Nid><HI>University Of Strathclyde, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Soft and Small: Acoustic Transducers Inspired by Nature</Name><PI>James Frederick Charles Windmill</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS9, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The use of sound by humanity is ubiquitous. We utilise sound across a far greater range than we can hear for numerous extremely beneficial tasks. In Nature many animals have evolved ears, many of which are sensitive to sounds beyond human audibility. This includes an enormous variety of insects whose miniature ears detect sound to communicate, to detect their prey, or to avoid their own predators. Over recent years our understanding of the different insect ear functions, such as frequency filtering, analysis and tuning, has improved greatly. Insect ears can also be far more sensitive than equivalently sized artificial microphones, and have embedded &#226;&#128;&#152;active&#226;&#128;&#153; and  &#226;&#128;&#152;passive&#226;&#128;&#153; functions, for example to actively tune their response, or passively match impedance to ensure sensitivity. However, we still know very little about the mechanical and physiological basis behind these functions.

This project will use our knowledge of how insects hear to inspire the design and prototyping of artificial acoustic sensors. Existing microphones and ultrasonic devices have severe physical sensitivity limitations. This project seeks to change the fundamental approach to sensor design using inspiration from biology, such that previous limitations on size, functionality, power consumption, and robustness are avoided, whilst advancing fundamental understanding of the insect ear&#226;&#128;&#153;s sensing capacity.

We are particularly interested in answering fundamental questions about how the molecules that regulate gene expression and DNA replication operate in the intracellular environment. These questions include how transcription factors and RNA polymerases have evolved to rapidly find and bind their specific binding sites on chromosomal DNA, how the initiation of DNA replication is coordinated with cell growth, how cells can filter out leakage during replication of repressed genes, and other questions related to how the physical limitations of molecular interactions constrain cellular regulation.
Answering these questions requires better methods to study intracellular kinetics at high spatial and temporal resolution. For this purpose we will develop single-molecule methods to probe kinetics without perturbing the system. The project depends on development in five different fields (1) new labeling methods using unnatural amino acids, (2) new hardware solutions for single molecule tracking, (3) new microfluidic designs for controlled growth conditions and image analysis, (4) new computational tools to extract the maximal amount of information from many short single molecule trajectories and (5) accurate ways of computing synthetic microscopy images.
In addressing the specific questions stated above the experiments are necessarily combined with biophysical modeling that makes it possible to tell if the experimental results are expected from the previously known interactions and physical limitations due to for example stochasticity, slow diffusion and confined geometries. Overall the project is unique in its ambition to make a physically consistent quantitative description of central processes of life at the molecular level.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,398,823</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPERMDESTRUCT"><Rcn>188680</Rcn><Nid>12224</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Cellular Destruction Mechanisms that Create New Lives</Name><PI>Eli Arama</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Apoptosis, the major form of programmed cell death (PCD), is executed by caspases. However, activation of caspases can also promote a variety of vital cellular processes. Furthermore, cell death can sometimes proceed in the absence of apoptotic caspases by triggering alternative cell death (ACD) pathways. The main goal of my proposal is to delineate the molecular mechanisms, pathways and components underlying three distinct, evolutionarily conserved, cellular destruction processes, all associated with the Drosophila sperm life cycle, and to screen blood DNA samples from fertility clinics for mutations in human homologous genes. The first process, termed germ cell death (GCD), eliminates about 25% of the pre-meiotic germ cells through an ACD pathway. In the second process, the bulk cytoplasmic contents of the terminally differentiating spermatids are removed in a process called &#226;&#128;&#152;individualization&#226;&#128;&#153;, which involves active caspases. The third process occurs immediately after fertilization to selectively eliminate the sperm mitochondrial derivative. Similar cellular processes are also instrumental for the development and homeostasis of a variety of tissues and organs in essentially all multicellular organisms. Therefore, not only will this study enhance our understanding of male germ cell maturation and function, this unique system also provides an opportunity to study these important cellular processes using physiological conditions. The extraordinary degree of anatomical and molecular conservation of spermatogenesis in animals with flagellated sperm also signifies the extension of these studies to human patients. Although human infertility is a major health problem affecting 7% of men world-wide, we are still rather ignorant about the genetic causes of male infertility. My proposed approach, therefore, is feasible and efficient, and can overcome technical, practical, and ethical limitations associated with large-scale studies in humans.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPOT.COM"><Rcn>188676</Rcn><Nid>12230</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Evolution of a Drosophila wing pigmentation spot, a sexual communication system</Name><PI>Benjamin Prud'homme</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Explaining the origin of complex morphological innovations, in particular conspicuous male ornaments, remains one of the most challenging and exciting questions in the field of evolution. Indeed, conspicuous male-specific traits, either displayed to females during courtship, or used as weapons in battles, likely represent liabilities and should be opposed by natural selection. Darwin proposed that sexual selection is responsible for the evolution of these sexual traits. Since Darwin's time this hypothesis has received considerable theoretical and empirical support. Sexual selection is now perceived as a pervasive force shaping sexual communication systems, acting both on male signaling traits and female preference for these traits. Beyond this generic setup, however, the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of male ornaments, and the female preference for these traits, remain largely elusive.
The objective of this project is to decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of a sexual communication system in Drosophila species that have evolved a novel male-specific wing pigmentation pattern displayed to females during courtship. We will examine the emergence, the diversification, and the independent evolution of the male wing pigmentation pattern.
We will in particular (i) determine the genetic architecture underlying the formation of the male wing spot in Drosophila biarmipes; (ii) map the genetic sources of male wing spot divergence among species (shape, color, and intensity); (iii) identify the genetic and functional bases of the recurrent evolution of the wing spot, and (iv) characterize the nature of the female&#226;&#128;&#153;s reproductive preference.

Fifty years of intense research have revealed many key elements of the biology of this neurodegenerative disorder. However, our understanding of the molecular bases of the disease is still very limited, and the available medical treatments for AD are purely symptomatic and hardly effective. It is now clear that the modulation of a single target is unlikely to yield the desired outcome, and we should move from gene-centric to network-centric therapeutic strategies. In addition, we should focus on early (asymptomatic) phases of AD, before the brain damage is irreversible, and the identification of molecular biomarkers to monitor the response of patients is paramount.

Accordingly, the main objective of our proposal is the identification of novel biomarkers in AD to monitor the onset and progression of the pathology from very early stages, and to discover combinations of drug targets and chemical compounds able to modify the biology of the disease. We will first run proteomics and transcriptomics experiments, in AD mouse models, to reveal the organization of proteins and genes that are up- or down-regulated at different ages and AD stages, and their potential translocation into/out of mitochondria. We will then construct the AD-associated network, incorporating clinical data, which we will use as a framework for the integration and analyses of the &#226;&#128;&#147;omics data collected. We will transform the static data snapshots, corresponding to the different AD stages, into a dynamic model able to explain the progression of the disease, providing hints as to the best strategies to monitor and modulate AD evolution. We will finally design and validate a systems pharmacology strategy, based on concerted multi-target perturbations with small molecules, to modify the biology of the disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,296,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="THESEUS"><Rcn>189854</Rcn><Nid>11801</Nid><HI>The Francis Crick Institute Limited, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Tumour Heterogeneity and Somatic Evolution of Unstable cancer genomes</Name><PI>Robert Charles Swanton</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Summary
The majority of metastastic solid tumours remain incurable. In-depth analysis of tumour genomes is revealing evidence for branched evolution and cancer subclonal spatial and temporal intratumour heterogeneity (ITH). Drivers of ITH such as chromosomal instability (CIN) are associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. However, despite increasing knowledge of tumour diversity, there is limited insight into the mechanisms driving genomic instability and ITH or the processes that shape cancer genome evolution over time and space. Many animal tumour models fail to recapitulate patterns of genomic instability witnessed in human tumours, limiting insight into the forces that shape tumour evolution in vivo. We have found evidence for parallel subclonal evolution, resulting in the same gene or signal transduction pathway being subject to distinct inactivating or activating somatic events in different regions of the same tumour (Gerlinger NEJM 2012). These data suggest that in-depth analysis of tumour evolution may help define routes through which tumours must progress, offering opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches. We will develop new animal models of ITH, by developing knock-out strains for two suppressors of replication stress and CIN, recently identified in our laboratory (Burrell Nature 2013). These models will be used to study cancer evolution in order to decipher the impact of selection pressures, such as DNA damaging agents and cancer cytotoxics, on genomic complexity and diversity in emergent resistant subclones. In addition, through combined cancer informatics and functional genomics approaches we aim to identify novel mechanisms driving tumour heterogeneity and biological processes that permit the propagation of heterogeneous cells using novel transposon based approaches.

TOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and derivatives, are used clinically to treat cancer, cardio-vasculature disease and to prevent organ rejection.

We recently reported that both TORC1/2 are wired in feedback loops, where their downstream cellular effectors are at the same time upstream regulators.  It is this feedback loop that ultimately mediates the intrinsic role of TORC1/2 in cellular homeostasis:  TORC1/2 detects deviations from a steady-state condition and by means of these feedback loops returns the cell to its homeostatic situation.  We propose to systematically identify the TORC1/2 homeostatic signalling loops.  Subsequent characterization will focus on the signalling networks controlling intermediary metabolism.  Our ultimate goal is to comprehensively unravel the TORC1/2-dependent metabolic networks composed of regulatory feedback loops which will reveal the fundamental role of the TOR Complexes as molecular devices to achieve cellular homeostasis."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,991,686</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSLATE"><Rcn>185675</Rcn><Nid>12032</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Specificity of translational control during unfolded protein response</Name><PI>Jernej Ule</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated by multiple types of cellular stress, and can promote either cell survival or apoptosis. The balance between these opposing outcomes is delicately regulated, and when lost, contributes to diverse diseases. UPR enables cells to halt general translation, while inducing translation and transcription of specific mRNAs that escape repression. Even though the general machinery controlling translation is well understood, several fundamental open questions remain: 1) how are mRNAs selected for translation during UPR, 2) what role does mRNA structure and sequence play in this selection, 3) what role does UPR pathway play in the highly differentiated cells, such as neurons? My lab employs an integrative approach to understand how RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control specific mRNAs. We recently developed hiCLIP, a method that globally quantifies interactions between RBPs and double-stranded RNA in live cells. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that a double-stranded RBP binds to structured motifs in mRNAs to control stress-induced translation. I propose to determine how combinatorial recognition of RNA sequence and structure by RBPs controls mRNA localisation, stability and translation during UPR. In addition, we will assess the role of UPR pathway in neuronal differentiation. Taken together, this study aims to elucidate how cells select specific mRNAs for translation, and thereby survive during stress or respond to signals that control differentiation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,435</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRNAPROLIF"><Rcn>185635</Rcn><Nid>12339</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Control of translation efficiency in proliferating and differentiated mammalian cells</Name><PI>Yitzhak Pilpel</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Translation maps the transcriptome onto the proteome.

tRNAProlif offers an approach that consists of genome-wide measurements and analyses of the tRNA and mRNAs pools, and the interplay between them, in proliferative and differentiated cells. The project will explain how changes in translation affect, and are affected by, these two states.
We rely on our preliminary results that show a striking dichotomy in codon usage: genes involved in cellular proliferation have distinct codon usage compared to genes involved in differentiation and other multi-cellular process. Further, the tRNA pool consists of two distinct sub-populations: tRNAs whose codons are enriched among the proliferation genes are induced in proliferation and cancer, and tRNAs whose codons are enriched in differentiation genes are repressed in proliferation and are induced in differentiation. Towards understanding this &#226;&#128;&#156;tRNA Switch&#226;&#128;&#157; we aim at:
Causality: We will determine whether the tRNA pool affects the proliferation/differentiation status of cell. Conversely, we will determine the effects of the proliferation/differentiation status on the tRNA pool.

Among such physical cues, mechanical tension is emerging as central regulator of cellular fate and function. To explain tension regulation, current research emphasizes molecular mechanisms at an ever increasing level of detail. How these local mechanisms are integrated to give rise to global patterns of tissue tension is unknown, however. The goal of this project is to provide a multiscale understanding of tension regulation within epithelial cell monolayers. We propose two pairs of competing mechanisms for tension regulation: fluidization vs. reinforcement and cell division vs. apoptosis. These competing mechanisms are inherently multiscale in the sense that they span and couple multiple levels of tissue organization, from the local actomyosin contraction to the multicellular rearrangement. For each of these competing mechanisms we plan to study how local processes and interactions give rise to global tensional patterns. To do this, we propose to develop an integrated experimental setup to map and perturb monolayer tension at different length scales.

At a macroevolutionary scale this leads to the prediction that speciation is driven by the rate of trait evolution rather than the state of the trait. Despite the established theoretical links between trait evolution and speciation, most macroevolutionary studies focus on predicting speciation as a state dependent process. To date the hypothesis that rapid speciation is driven by rapid trait evolution has rarely been tested. If the rate or degree of divergence in species traits is an important factor in driving differences in speciation rates among lineages then there must also be variation in rates of trait evolution among lineages. Using my recently completed phylogeny of all extant birds, novel datasets of ecomorphological and secondary sexual traits, and computer simulations, I will carry out the first large-scale analyses to determine the extent to which rates of phenotypic evolution vary among lineages and across space, test the causes of non-constant evolutionary rates, and derive and test predictions on the effects of rates of trait evolution on speciation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,717,624</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TransMETH"><Rcn>188667</Rcn><Nid>12217</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Identification of novel functions and regulators of DNA methylation in mammals</Name><PI>Micha&#195;&#171;l Philippe Weber</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The development of complex organisms entails sequence-specific transcription factors and also epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. Methylation of DNA occurs on cytosines and can be transmitted over many cell generations to sustain epigenetic memory. Yet we still know very little about how DNA methylation is attracted to specific sites in the genome and how this ultimately influences cellular destiny. This is a fascinating challenge that deserves intensive investigations because DNA methylation is critical for both normal and pathological cellular functions.
I propose to initiate an ambitious research project that will identify novel functions and regulators of DNA methylation in the mouse. My objectives are to (1) use genome-wide mapping and elegant mouse genetics to elucidate the role of DNA methylation in lineage identity in physiological contexts in vivo; (2) design original high-throughput RNAi screens to identify novel factors that shape the DNA methylome in mammalian genomes; and (3) develop tools for targeted engineering of the methylome that will allow, for the first time, to test predictive models by interfering with DNA methylation at specific sites in the genome.
This combination of innovative approaches will lead to major breakthroughs that go beyond the current state-of-art. We will assess causal and mechanistic relationships between DNA methylation and cell identity at the genome level, and identify novel epigenetic regulators for long term studies to characterize their mechanism of action.

Therefore, many studies address the central transcriptional pathways that regulate cholesterol metabolism. However, transcriptional regulation does not allow cells to quickly adapt to the cholesterol fluxes that they encounter. For this, rapid and reversible post-transcriptional modifications are used, in conjunction with transcriptional control. Ubiquitylation - the post-transcriptional conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins &#226;&#128;&#147; is studied in relation to many cellular processes. Much less is known about the contribution of the ubiquitin-proteasomal-system (UPS) to regulation of lipid metabolism and development of cardiovascular disease.

I recently identified the E3-ubiquitin ligase IDOL as a novel post-transcriptional regulator of the LDLR pathway. My lab also recently identified two genes, the E3-ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 and the de-ubiquitylase USP2, for which no role in sterol metabolism was known, as important regulators of cellular cholesterol metabolism. With IDOL, these genes control key nodes of cholesterol synthesis and uptake and represent previously unrecognized mechanisms to control cholesterol homeostasis. To study the contribution of these genes to cholesterol metabolism, we will use state-of-the-art mutant mouse models, in vitro assays, and a unique collection of dyslipidemic patient material. Our goal is to characterize the contribution of these genes to cholesterol homeostasis and to examine their involvement in the development of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.

Investigating these novel regulatory systems will provide important mechanistic insight into the contribution of the UPS to cholesterol metabolism in health and disease. As components of the UPS are amenable to pharmacological manipulation these studies could potentially lead to novel targets for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UbInflam"><Rcn>192477</Rcn><Nid>13445</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Regulation of inflammasome activity through NLRP3 ubiquitination level</Name><PI>Benedicte Francoise Py</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The innate immunity constitutes an efficient barrier by rapidly detecting pathogens and tissue damages through pattern recognition receptors including NLRP3. On the other hand, inappropriate NLRP3 activation causes deleterious inflammation and contributes to various conditions including atherosclerosis, diabetes, gout and Alzheimer's diseases. Therefore NLRP3 requires tight regulation that remains poorly characterized. Activated NLRP3 assembles a multimeric inflammasome complex serving as activation platform for caspase-1 that controls processing and release of cytosolic cytokines including IL-1&#206;&#178;. We recently evidenced that inflammasome assembly requires NLRP3 deubiquitination by the deubiquitinase BRCC3. The aim of this proposal is to decipher this new ubiquitin-dependent regulatory pathway critical for NLRP3 activation. We propose to identify stimuli, signaling pathways and enzymatic complexes controlling NLRP3 ubiquitination level. Using both cell biology and biochemistry approaches, we will decipher the molecular mechanisms beneath the regulation of the deubiquitinase and ubiquitin ligase complex activity, as well as the loss of activity of ubiquitinated NLRP3. Lastly, we will test the in vivo relevance of NLRP3 ubiquitination using both mouse models, patients study and pharmacological approach. Altogether, this project will thoroughly characterize this new pathway controlling inflammasome activity and provide new therapeutic targets against inflammation related diseases that are highly prevalent in the European Union.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,933,724</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ViVARNAsilencing"><Rcn>185604</Rcn><Nid>12009</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Antiviral Defense in the Vector Mosquito Aedes aegypti: induction and suppression of RNA silencing pathways</Name><PI>Ronald Van Rij</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes and other blood-feeding arthropods transmit important human and animal viruses (arthropod-borne viruses, arboviruses). With the increasing global threat of arboviruses, it is essential to understand the virus-vector interactions that determine virus transmission. The mosquito antiviral immune response is a key determinant of virus replication and transmission. We recently showed that arboviruses are targeted by a poorly-understood RNA silencing pathway in the major vector mosquito Aedes aegypti: the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Our (published and unpublished) observations imply that the piRNA pathway contributes to antiviral defense against different classes of viruses in somatic tissues of mosquitoes. Moreover, we identified a novel class of endogenous gene-derived piRNAs in mosquitoes that may form a new paradigm for piRNA-based regulation of cellular gene expression.

AIM: This proposal has a three-fold aim: i) to delineate the biogenesis and function of the novel classes of virus- and gene-derived piRNAs, ii) to characterize mechanisms by which (arbo)viruses suppress or evade antiviral RNA silencing pathways, and by doing so, iii) to establish mosquitoes as an experimental model to characterize the complex piRNA machinery.

APPROACH: We will use Aedes cell lines that recapitulate all aspects of piRNA biogenesis. This allows us to use a unique, powerful approach of genomic, cell biological, biochemical, and proteomic methodologies to study piRNA biogenesis and function.

IMPORTANCE AND INNOVATION: This is the first study to comprehensively characterize viral and cellular piRNA biogenesis and function in mosquitoes. This proposal provides novel insights into the antiviral response in mosquitoes and may uncover novel regulatory functions of endogenous piRNAs. Moreover, it establishes a platform for functional and biochemical dissection of the complex biogenesis of piRNAs - the most enigmatic class of small silencing RNAs.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="WaterWalking"><Rcn>185626</Rcn><Nid>12015</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Water-walking insects: marrying evo-devo with ecology for a better understanding of morphological evolution</Name><PI>Abderrahman Khila</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), LS8, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding the origin of the remarkable biodiversity in nature is an important goal in biological studies. Despite recent advances in evolutionary developmental biology, our understanding of the interaction between developmental genetic processes and the ecological environment in shaping the phenotype remains largely fragmented. This is mainly because of the difficulty to transfer molecular genetic tools to natural systems where we have a good understanding of the ecology. In this proposal, we combine original natural systems, water-walking insects, with state of the art tools of functional and developmental genetics, to study the interplay between developmental genetic pathways and the ecological environment, and how this interaction can shape adaptive phenotypic change. About 200 million years ago, the common ancestor of water-walking insects (Heteroptera, Gerromorpha) invaded water surface and radiated into a diverse array of niches, from shorelines to open oceans. This ecological transition and specialization is associated with an array of adaptive changes that enabled these insects to support their body weight and generate efficient propulsion on the water surface.
In this project, we aim to develop a multilevel functional approach that combines developmental and evolutionary genetics, ecology, and comparative genomics and transcriptomics, to study a set of key morphological traits directly associated with the initial event of transition to water surface life, and the diversification that followed. To achieve this, we chose three water-walking insects, along with a terrestrial and under-water outgroups, based on their morphology, ecology, and amenability for laboratory culturing and functional experiments. We will identify the genes and genetic changes responsible for the development and evolution of the hydrophobic bristles &#226;&#128;&#147;a key trait that was instrumental in the transition from terrestrial to water surface life.

To determine how these bio-molecules assemble into a highly organized molecular system has remained a major challenge. Here, we aim to unravel how dozens of proteins assemble into a large molecular machinery that degrades mRNA in an efficient and regulated manner.

On an atomic level, we will determine the static structures of the enzymes involved in the mRNA degradation pathways. In parallel, we will develop and exploit novel methods in NMR spectroscopy to correlate molecular motions with catalytic activity. Especially for the 450 kDa eukaryotic exosome complex, these studies will significantly push the limits of what is currently achievable. On a molecular level, we will reconstitute the mRNA degradation machinery from purified components in a stepwise manner. In this challenging approach, we will use NMR spectroscopy to follow how the enzymes engage in a network of interactions that regulate the mRNA degradation process. These studies will also provide us with the unique possibility to reproduce complex cellular behavior in a well defined and easy to manipulate in vitro system. On a microscopic level the mRNA degradation machinery assembles into cytoplasmic processing bodies. The role of these conserved cellular foci is a matter of debate and we aim to determine both the atomic details that result in this self-organization as well as the catalytic advantages that result from this clustering.

Our study will provide a very detailed and accurate description of how essential and central molecular processes in mRNA degradation are regulated and modulated. The level of detail that we aim to achieve is currently not available for any cellular pathway of such complexity. In that regard, our projects also provide knowledge and methodology required to study additional and complex cellular functions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,966,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACQDIV"><Rcn>191230</Rcn><Nid>10607</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Acquisition processes in maximally diverse languages: Min(d)ing the ambient language</Name><PI>Sabine Erika Stoll</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Children learn any language that they grow up with, adapting to any of the ca. 7000 languages of the world, no matter how divergent or complex their structures are. What cognitive processes make this extreme flexibility possible? This is one of the most burning questions in cognitive science and the ACQDIV project aims at answering it by testing and refining the following leading hypothesis: Language acquisition is flexible and adaptive to any kind of language because it relies on a small set of universal cognitive processes that variably target different structures at different times during acquisition in every language. The project aims at establishing the precise set of processes and at determining the conditions of variation across maximally diverse languages. This project focuses on three processes: (i) distributional learning, (ii) generalization-based learning and (iii) interaction-based learning. To investigate these processes I will work with a sample of five clusters of languages including longitudinal data of two languages each. The clusters were determined by a clustering algorithm seeking the structurally most divergent languages in a typological database. The languages are: Cluster 1: Slavey and Cree, Cluster 2: Indonesian and Yucatec, Cluster 3: Inuktitut and Chintang, Cluster 4: Sesotho and Russian, Cluster 5: Japanese and Turkish. For all languages, corpora are available, except for Slavey where fieldwork is planned. The leading hypothesis will be tested against the acquisition of aspect and negation in each language of the sample and also against the two structures in each language that are most salient and challenging in them (e. g. complex morphology in Chintang). The acquisition processes also depend on statistical patterns in the input children receive. I will examine these patterns across the sample with respect to repetitiveness effects, applying data-mining methods and systematically comparing child-directed and child-surrounding speech."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADaPt"><Rcn>189849</Rcn><Nid>11805</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype: understanding the roles of climate, natural selection and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer adaptability</Name><PI>Jay Stock</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Relative to other species, humans are characterised by considerable biological diversity despite genetic homogeneity. This diversity is reflected in skeletal variation, but we lack sufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms to adequately interpret the archaeological record. The proposed research will address problems in our current understanding of the origins of human variation in the past by: 1) documenting and interpreting the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation relative to genetic phylogenies and climatic variation; 2) testing the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation among genetically related hunter-gatherers from different environments; 3) examining the adaptability of living humans to different environments, through the study of energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs associated with locomotion; and 4) investigating the relationship between muscle and skeletal variation associated with locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved by linking: a) detailed study of the global pattern of hunter-gatherer variation in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene with; b) ground-breaking experimental research which tests the relationship between energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans. The first component tests the correspondence between skeletal variation and both genetic and climatic history, to infer mechanisms driving variation. The second component integrates this skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans to, for the first time, directly test adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. ADaPt will provide the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics that may have shaped our success as a species.

Apartheid routinely breached the separation that it names. Whereas the South African regime was deeply isolationist in international terms, new research links it to the Cold War and decolonization. Yet this trend does not consider sufficiently that the global contest over the meaning of apartheid and resistance to it occurs on the terrain of culture. My project argues that studying the global circulation of South African cultural formations in the apartheid era provides novel historiographic leverage over Western liberalism during the Cold War. It recasts apartheid as an apparatus of transnational cultural production, turning existing historiography inside out. This study seeks:
&#8226; To provide the first systematic account of the deterritorialization of &#8220;apartheid&#8221;&#8212;as political signifier and as apparatus generating circuits of transnational cultural production.
&#8226; To analyze these itinerant cultural formations across media and national borders, articulating new intersections.
&#8226; To map the itineraries of major South African exiles, where exile is taken to be a system of interlinked circuits of affiliation and cultural production.
&#8226; To revise the historiography of states other than South Africa through the lens of deterritorialized apartheid-era formations at their respective destinations.
&#8226; To show how apartheid reveals contradictions within Western liberalism during the Cold War, with special reference to racial inequality.
Methodologically, I introduce the model of thick convergence to analyze three periods:
1. Kliptown &amp; Bandung: Novel possibilities, 1948-1960.
2. Sharpeville &amp; Memphis: Drumming up resistance, 1960-1976.
3. From Soweto to Berlin: Spectacle at the barricades, 1976-1990.
Each explores a cultural dominant in the form of texts, soundscapes or photographs.

This question is facing statisticians as they grapple with standardising national census methods so that their numbers can be assembled into a European population. Yet, by so doing&#8212;intentionally or otherwise&#8212;they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.

Why is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'

ARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago. At the same time it will attend to how these practices affect the constitution of who are the people of Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,833,649</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINandMINDFULNESS"><Rcn>192255</Rcn><Nid>13231</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Impact of Mental Training of Attention and Emotion Regulation on Brain and Behavior: Implications for Neuroplasticity, Well-Being and Mindfulness Psychotherapy Research</Name><PI>Antoine Lutz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Mindfulness-based therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment to reduce stress, increase well-being and prevent relapse in depression. A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#8217;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development. Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving.
I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks.
Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate.
Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development.

Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix.

The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level.

What does creativity mean in the context of China, and what does it do? When both the state and profoundly globalised creative industries are so deeply implicated in the promotion of creativity, what are the possibilities of criticality, if any?

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACQDIV"><Rcn>191230</Rcn><Nid>10607</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Acquisition processes in maximally diverse languages: Min(d)ing the ambient language</Name><PI>Sabine Erika Stoll</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Children learn any language that they grow up with, adapting to any of the ca. 7000 languages of the world, no matter how divergent or complex their structures are. What cognitive processes make this extreme flexibility possible? This is one of the most burning questions in cognitive science and the ACQDIV project aims at answering it by testing and refining the following leading hypothesis: Language acquisition is flexible and adaptive to any kind of language because it relies on a small set of universal cognitive processes that variably target different structures at different times during acquisition in every language. The project aims at establishing the precise set of processes and at determining the conditions of variation across maximally diverse languages. This project focuses on three processes: (i) distributional learning, (ii) generalization-based learning and (iii) interaction-based learning. To investigate these processes I will work with a sample of five clusters of languages including longitudinal data of two languages each. The clusters were determined by a clustering algorithm seeking the structurally most divergent languages in a typological database. The languages are: Cluster 1: Slavey and Cree, Cluster 2: Indonesian and Yucatec, Cluster 3: Inuktitut and Chintang, Cluster 4: Sesotho and Russian, Cluster 5: Japanese and Turkish. For all languages, corpora are available, except for Slavey where fieldwork is planned. The leading hypothesis will be tested against the acquisition of aspect and negation in each language of the sample and also against the two structures in each language that are most salient and challenging in them (e. g. complex morphology in Chintang). The acquisition processes also depend on statistical patterns in the input children receive. I will examine these patterns across the sample with respect to repetitiveness effects, applying data-mining methods and systematically comparing child-directed and child-surrounding speech."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,438</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADaPt"><Rcn>189849</Rcn><Nid>11805</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype: understanding the roles of climate, natural selection and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer adaptability</Name><PI>Jay Stock</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Relative to other species, humans are characterised by considerable biological diversity despite genetic homogeneity. This diversity is reflected in skeletal variation, but we lack sufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms to adequately interpret the archaeological record. The proposed research will address problems in our current understanding of the origins of human variation in the past by: 1) documenting and interpreting the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation relative to genetic phylogenies and climatic variation; 2) testing the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation among genetically related hunter-gatherers from different environments; 3) examining the adaptability of living humans to different environments, through the study of energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs associated with locomotion; and 4) investigating the relationship between muscle and skeletal variation associated with locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved by linking: a) detailed study of the global pattern of hunter-gatherer variation in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene with; b) ground-breaking experimental research which tests the relationship between energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans. The first component tests the correspondence between skeletal variation and both genetic and climatic history, to infer mechanisms driving variation. The second component integrates this skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans to, for the first time, directly test adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. ADaPt will provide the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics that may have shaped our success as a species. It will lead to breakthroughs necessary to interpret variation in the archaeological record, relative to human dispersals and adaptation in the past.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,911,485</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="APARTHEID-STOPS"><Rcn>185596</Rcn><Nid>11991</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>"Apartheid-- The Global Itinerary: South African Cultural Formations in Transnational Circulation, 1948-1990"</Name><PI>Louise Bethlehem</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal proceeds from an anomaly. Apartheid routinely breached the separation that it names. Whereas the South African regime was deeply isolationist in international terms, new research links it to the Cold War and decolonization. Yet this trend does not consider sufficiently that the global contest over the meaning of apartheid and resistance to it occurs on the terrain of culture. My project argues that studying the global circulation of South African cultural formations in the apartheid era provides novel historiographic leverage over Western liberalism during the Cold War. It recasts apartheid as an apparatus of transnational cultural production, turning existing historiography inside out. This study seeks:
&#226;&#128;&#162; To provide the first systematic account of the deterritorialization of &#226;&#128;&#156;apartheid&#226;&#128;&#157;&#226;&#128;&#148;as political signifier and as apparatus generating circuits of transnational cultural production.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To analyze these itinerant cultural formations across media and national borders, articulating new intersections.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To map the itineraries of major South African exiles, where exile is taken to be a system of interlinked circuits of affiliation and cultural production.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To revise the historiography of states other than South Africa through the lens of deterritorialized apartheid-era formations at their respective destinations.
&#226;&#128;&#162; To show how apartheid reveals contradictions within Western liberalism during the Cold War, with special reference to racial inequality.
Methodologically, I introduce the model of thick convergence to analyze three periods:
1. Kliptown &amp; Bandung: Novel possibilities, 1948-1960.
2. Sharpeville &amp; Memphis: Drumming up resistance, 1960-1976.
3. From Soweto to Berlin: Spectacle at the barricades, 1976-1990.
Each explores a cultural dominant in the form of texts, soundscapes or photographs.

This question is facing statisticians as they grapple with standardising national census methods so that their numbers can be assembled into a European population. Yet, by so doing&#226;&#128;&#148;intentionally or otherwise&#226;&#128;&#148;they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.

Why is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'

ARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago. At the same time it will attend to how these practices affect the constitution of who are the people of Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,833,649</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINandMINDFULNESS"><Rcn>192255</Rcn><Nid>13231</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Impact of Mental Training of Attention and Emotion Regulation on Brain and Behavior: Implications for Neuroplasticity, Well-Being and Mindfulness Psychotherapy Research</Name><PI>Antoine Lutz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Mindfulness-based therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment to reduce stress, increase well-being and prevent relapse in depression. A key component of these therapies includes mindfulness practice that intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Beyond its therapeutic application, the empirical study of mindfulness practice also represents a promising tool to understand practices that intentionally cultivate present-centeredness and openness to experience. Despite its clinical efficacy, little remains known about its means of action. Antithetic to this mode of experiential self-focus are states akin to depression, that are conducive of biased attention toward negativity, biased thoughts and rumination, and dysfunctional self schemas. The proposed research aims at implementing an innovative framework to scientifically investigate the experiential, cognitive, and neural processes underlining mindfulness practice building on the current neurocognitive understanding of the functional and anatomical architecture of cognitive control, and depression. To identify these mechanisms, this project aims to use paradigms from cognitive, and affective neuroscience (MEG, intracortical EEG, fMRI) to measure the training and plasticity of emotion regulation and cognitive control, and their effect on automatic, self-related affective processes. Using a cross-sectional design, this project aims to compare participants with trait differences in experiential self-focus mode. Using a longitudinal design, this project aims to explore mindfulness-practice training&#226;&#128;&#153;s effect using a standard mindfulness-based intervention and an active control intervention. The PI has pioneered the neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness in the US and aspires to assemble a research team in France and a network of collaborators in Europe to pursue this research, which could lead to important outcomes for neuroscience, and mental health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,868,520</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAREGIVING"><Rcn>185594</Rcn><Nid>12334</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting</Name><PI>Morten Lindtner Kringelbach</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The survival of species depends critically on infant survival and development. Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving.
I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks.
Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate.
Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,121</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CARP"><Rcn>189856</Rcn><Nid>10800</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Making Selves, Making Revolutions: Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics"</Name><PI>Martin Holbraad</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"What kinds of self does it take to make a revolution? And how does revolutionary politics, understood as a project of personal as much as political transformation, articulate with other processes of self-making, such as religious practices?

Developing a comparative matrix of revolutionary settings in the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, CARP&#226;&#128;&#153;s core objective is to investigate the differing permutations and dynamics of revolutionary &#226;&#128;&#152;anthropologies&#226;&#128;&#153; in the original theological sense of the term, i.e. charting revolutionary politics in relation to varying conceptions of what it is to be human, and of how the horizons of people&#226;&#128;&#153;s lives are to be understood in relation to divine orders of different kinds, in order to reveal how revolutions come to define what persons may be, deliberately setting the social, political, cultural and ultimately ontological coordinates within which people are made who they are. Bringing close ethnographic investigation to bear on conceptions of revolution, statecraft, and subjectivity in political theory, CARP will produce comprehensive political ethnographies of nine major case-studies, comparing systematically the relationship between revolution and religion in a selection of countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Four smaller-scale case-studies from Europe and Asia will add complementary dimensions to this comparative matrix. Providing much-needed empirical materials and analytical insight into the dynamic comingling of political and religious forms in the making of revolutionary selves, CARP&#226;&#128;&#153;s ultimate ambition is to launch the comparative study of revolutionary politics as a major new departure for anthropological research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,854,472</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORRODE"><Rcn>185583</Rcn><Nid>11387</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit&#195;&#164;t Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>Corroding the social?

The project&#226;&#128;&#153;s core goal is to provide empirical estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on four critical domains of social life, namely household incomes, demographic behaviour, educational attainment, as well as social integration and civic participation. The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level. To achieve robust causal inference, the project utilizes multilevel panel data modelling, notably two-way fixed-effects and related estimators that statistically control for unobserved heterogeneity at both the household and contextual level."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,876,758</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ChinaCreative"><Rcn>191352</Rcn><Nid>11887</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>From Made in China to Created in China- A Comparative Study of Creative Practice and Production in Contemporary China</Name><PI>Bastiaan Jeroen De Kloet</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>With its emergence as a global power, China aspires to move from a &#226;&#128;&#156;made in China&#226;&#128;&#157; towards a &#226;&#128;&#156;created in China&#226;&#128;&#157; country.

Furthermore, high quality spatially explicit information on land cover change is an essential input variable to land use change modelling, which is increasingly being used to better understand the potential impact of certain policies. The amount of observed land cover change also serves as an important indicator of how well different regional, national and European policies have been implemented.

However, outside Europe and outside the developed world in particular, information on land cover and land cover change in poorer countries is hardly available and no national or regional dense sample based monitoring approaches such as LUCAS exists which deliver sufficiently accurate land cover and land cover change information. Moreover in particular in developing countries, there is no or very little information on land-use and crop management. Only very limited data available from FAO and an incomplete coverage of sub-national statistics (e.g. IFPRI) are available.

Their outputs form a key component in guidance underpinning government and industry decisions on changes to policy, infrastructure developments or the introduction of new services or products. Given the significant financial, environmental and societal implications of such decisions, model accuracy is crucial. Current models however, while powerful and flexible, still present a highly abstract representation of consumer decisions. This project aims to develop a new framework which realigns modelled behaviour with real world behaviour, jointly representing the choice of multiple options or products and the quantity of consumption for each of these. In contrast with existing work, these choices will be placed within a wider framework, incorporating links between long term decisions and day to day choices, accounting for the growing importance of virtual social networks and the role of joint decisions. The work will ensure consistency with economic theory and in particular deal with the formation and role of budgets and constraints. While many developments will take place within the random utility framework, the project will also operationalize alternative theories of behaviour, such as non-compensatory decision rules from mathematical psychology. To ensure the transition of methodological developments into practice, I will test the models and illustrate their advantages in a large scale application studying the relationship between long term decisions and short term energy consumption. I will ensure that the models can produce output suitable for economic analysis and will develop free estimation software.

The spatial concentration of poverty within cities is of great concern to national governments, partly based on a belief in neighbourhood effects: the idea that living in deprived neighbourhoods has an additional negative effect on residents&#226;&#128;&#153; life chances over and above the effect of their own characteristics. This belief has contributed to the development of area-based policies designed to introduce a more &#226;&#128;&#152;favourable&#226;&#128;&#153; socio-economic mix in deprived neighbourhoods. Despite the persistent belief in neighbourhood effects, there is surprisingly little evidence that living in deprived neighbourhoods really affects individual lives. There is little consensus on the importance of neighbourhood effects, the underlying causal mechanisms, the conditions under which they are important and the most effective policy responses. It is likely that most studies claiming to have found that poor neighbourhoods make people poor(er) only show that poor people live in poor neighbourhoods because they cannot afford to live elsewhere. DEPRIVEDHOODS will break new ground by simultaneously studying neighbourhood sorting over the life course, neighbourhood change, and neighbourhood effects, within one theoretical and analytical framework. This project will be methodologically challenging and will be the first integrated, multi-country research project on neighbourhood effects to use unique geo-referenced longitudinal data from Sweden, United Kingdom, Estonia, and The Netherlands. Special attention will be paid to the operationalization of neighbourhoods and how it affects modelling outcomes. Through its integrated and international approach, DEPRIVEDHOODS will fundamentally advance understandings of the ways in which individual outcomes interact with the neighbourhood, which will ultimately lead to more targeted and effective policy measures."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,506</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ENLIFE"><Rcn>185634</Rcn><Nid>12324</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Engineering life: ideas, practices and promises</Name><PI>Jane Calvert</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The emerging field of synthetic biology promises to engineer the living world. This is potentially extremely contentious, so scholars from the social sciences and humanities have been incorporated into synthetic biology research programmes from the outset. The ENLIFE project&#226;&#128;&#153;s distinctive contribution will be to study both the engineering of biology and the role of social scientists within this. Its two objectives are: to investigate the movement of ideas, practices and promises from engineering into the life sciences, and to examine the ways in which social scientists and other groups are being mobilised as part of this endeavour.

We will carry out novel social scientific research into the engineering of living things, by collecting a rich body of empirical data. This will involve semi-structured qualitative interviews, participant observation at conferences, and ethnographic research in synthetic biology laboratories that are attempting to make biology easier to engineer. We will simultaneously address the interdisciplinary entanglements that arise in all these contexts, which involve scientists, engineers, social scientists, philosophers, lawyers and sometimes even artists and designers. We will also run four experimental interdisciplinary workshops, where we will explore the possibility of producing new knowledge together, across disciplinary divides.

The project aims to provide a critical, empirically grounded analysis of a field that promises to drive the next industrial revolution and is currently the target of high levels of investment across the globe. It will also provide insights into the engineering imagination, how it is applied to living things, and how it is challenged and expanded in interdisciplinary interactions. The study of these interactions will build on our understanding of the role of the social sciences in interdisciplinary collaborations, and contribute to pressing debates about the future of Science and Technology Studies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,559,389</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ERADICATION"><Rcn>192251</Rcn><Nid>13233</Nid><HI>Fondation Pour L Institut De Hautes Etudes Internationales Et Du Developpement, Switzerland</HI><Name>Eradication: the science and politics of a world without AIDS</Name><PI>Vinh-Kim Nguyen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>New biomedical technologies and public health strategies are being tested world-wide with the goal of eradicating the HIV epidemic. Achieving a world without AIDS has become the flagship of the vast global health apparatus, rallying governments, international organisations, philanthropic and pharmaceutical capital, research networks and activists. Mass screening and treatment, preventive drugs and gels, and molecular maps of sexual networks have shifted the biomedical paradigm from one of control to one of eradication. The biopolitical armamentarium of the push to eradicate may inadvertently enable unexpected biological, cultural, social and political transformations. Mass treatment and preventive drugs require very high levels of compliance to achieve the desired public health effects, foreshadowing the coercive potential of eradication efforts. Intensified mapping of &#226;&#128;&#156;most at-risk populations&#226;&#128;&#157; marks a shift from the existing emphasis on rights and empowerment to one of surveillance and discipline. As these approaches remain unproven, eradication constitutes a global public health experiment of unprecedented proportions, whose outcomes will shape global health efforts for decades to come. Eradication efforts to rid the world of HIV are attempts to order nature as revealed through a global epidemic, putting them squarely at the centre of anthropological concern. The two overarching questions are: what will HIV eradication efforts achieve? What are the reasons for the outcome, be it partial success or partial failure? To answer these questions, a multi-sited ethnography will be conducted in Africa, Europe and North America of the science and politics of HIV eradication. It will focus on the testing, preparation, and implementation of the three key technologies of HIV eradication: universal testing and mass treatment, molecular mapping of sexual and social networks.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,980</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXPECT HEAL-TH"><Rcn>191236</Rcn><Nid>11901</Nid><HI>Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>Empowering expectations for health and disease: training the immune and endocrine system</Name><PI>Andrea Evers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Expectations about health and disease induce immune and endocrine responses and directly affect health and treatment outcomes. However, there is an urge to understand the mechanical underpinnings how expectations affect immune and endocrine responses and how this knowledge can be used for therapeutic interventions.
My research group studies the main expectancy learning mechanisms for itch and pain as a generic expectancy model across symptoms and conditions. We recently showed that dual expectancy learning processes (i.e. conditioning and suggestions) are most powerful for itch symptoms, corresponding with findings for other symptoms and conditions. Based on these studies, I propose a groundbreaking dual expectancy learning approach, testing whether combined expectancy learning processes (i.e. both conditioning and suggestions, offered with personalized cues and exposure to relevant stressors) affect most profoundly the immune and endocrine system, in turn affecting health and disease outcomes.
The major aim is to unravel the central mechanisms of how peoples&#226;&#128;&#153; expectations affect immune and endocrine responses and related health outcomes, through the use of pioneering multidisciplinary methods in healthy and clinical populations. First, we systematically train immune and endocrine responses and relate them to psychological, neurobiological and genetic mechanisms. Second, we test these manipulations for physical health challenges (e.g. inflammatory or allergic histamine reactions) in healthy subjects and patients. Third, we study the long-term effects in chronic inflammatory itch and pain conditions (e.g. replacing anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapies, reducing side effects).
This interdisciplinary, cross-boundary project progresses key theoretical knowledge of the central expectation mechanisms for immune and endocrine responses. Findings open new horizons for  health prevention and therapeutic interventions for various inflammatory conditions and physical symptoms.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,981,009</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Emerging Subjects"><Rcn>188675</Rcn><Nid>11362</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Emerging Subjects of the New Economy: Tracing Economic Growth in Mongolia</Name><PI>Rebecca Anna Empson Mannerfelt</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project examines how predicted economic growth is experienced by people in Mongolia with the advent of large-scale mining operations. Our project will generate new insight into two areas of concern for economic anthropology and beyond.  First we will examine the way that the economy is unfolding in a distinct way in East Asia through different kinds of predictive narratives that come to have an effect on the way people act. Second we will explore how individual subjects also shape the economy in their everyday relations through various forms of exchange and the accumulation of wealth.

This dual focus provides the basis for a nuanced and powerful critique of our understanding of the way in which economic realities are shaped through predictive narratives as well as formed, from the ground-up, by local actors who carve out new forms of subjectivity through such actions. Indeed it is our suggestion that these new subjects of the growing economy are distinctly different from the post-socialist selves described in previous literature on the region. Instead they are powerful and hopeful subjects who demand a different kind of engagement and entitlement. The form such engagement takes and the kind of economic realities produced out of such forms is the focus of our study.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,658,373</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Forecasting"><Rcn>185600</Rcn><Nid>12332</Nid><HI>Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain</HI><Name>New Methods and Applications for Forecast Evaluation</Name><PI>Barbara Rossi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Forecasting is a fundamental tool in Economics, Statistics, Business and other sciences. Judging whether forecasts are good and robust is of great importance since forecasts are used everyday to guide policymakers' and practitioners' decisions. The proposal aims at addressing four important issues that researchers encounter in practice.

A first issue is how to assess whether forecasts are optimal in the presence of instabilities. Optimality is an important property of models&#226;&#128;&#153; forecasts: if forecasts are not optimal, then the model can be improved. Existing methods to assess forecast optimality are not robust to the presence of instabilities, which are widespread in the data. How to obtain such robust methods and what they tell us about widely used economic models&#226;&#128;&#153; forecasts is the first task of this project.

A second problem faced by forecasters in practice is to evaluate density forecasts. Density forecasts are important tools for policymakers since they quantify uncertainty around forecasts. However, existing methodologies focus on a null hypothesis that is not necessarily the one of interest to the forecaster. The second task is to develop tests for forecast density evaluation that address forecasters&#226;&#128;&#153; needs.

A third, important question is &#226;&#128;&#156;Why Do We Use Forecast Tests To Evaluate Models&#226;&#128;&#153; Performance?&#226;&#128;&#157;. The third task of this project is to understand the relationship between traditional in-sample and forecast evaluation tests, and develop a framework that helps to understand under which circumstances forecast tests are more useful than typical in-sample tests.

A final question is how researchers can improve models that do not forecast well. Model misspecification is widespread, still economists are often left wondering exactly which parts of their models are misspecified. The fourth task is to propose an empirical framework for addressing this issue. By estimating time-varying wedges, we assess where misspecification is located, and how important it is.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>501,860</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GBR"><Rcn>185658</Rcn><Nid>12024</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genius before Romanticism: Ingenuity in Early Modern Art and Science</Name><PI>Alexander John Marr</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Genius before Romanticism: Ingenuity in Early Modern Art and Science

What existed in the European imagination before the Romantic concept of &#226;&#128;&#152;genius&#226;&#128;&#153;?  This five-year project will examine notions of unique talent, heightened imagination and extraordinary creativity in art and science by exploring the language, theories, practices and products of ingenium (ingenuity) ca. 1450-ca. 1750.  Drawing on the perspectives of history of art, history of science, technology and medicine, intellectual history and literary studies, the project seeks to capture ingenuity across and between disciplines.  Studying five countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and England) across three centuries, it will trace ingenuity&#226;&#128;&#153;s shifting patterns and fragmented fortunes over the longue dur&#195;&#169;e.

Research will be conducted in four strands, focused on distinctive but interrelated aspects of ingenuity.  Strand 1, The &#226;&#128;&#152;Language of Ingenuity&#226;&#128;&#153;, will chart the word history of the ingenuity family of terms.  Strand 2, &#226;&#128;&#152;Conceptualizing Ingenuity&#226;&#128;&#153;, will explore the intellectual framework of ingenuity through its theoretical treatment in natural philosophy and artistic theory.  Strand 3, &#226;&#128;&#152;Ingenuity in the Making&#226;&#128;&#153;, will examine the cunning knowledge of ingenious craftsmen and the properties of &#226;&#128;&#152;spirited&#226;&#128;&#153; materials.  Strand 4, &#226;&#128;&#152;Ingenious Images&#226;&#128;&#153;, will investigate the visual culture of ingenuity, from the iconography of ingenium to the witty disingenuousness of optical games.

The findings of the project team will be disseminated to a scholarly audience and the wider public through monographs, volumes of essays, a critical edition, an exhibition, conferences and colloquia, and a project website."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,785,671</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GRAPH"><Rcn>191237</Rcn><Nid>11900</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>The Great War and Modern Philosophy</Name><PI>Nicolas James Laurent Fernando De Warren</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The First World War was an unprecedented event of destruction, transformation, and renewal that left no aspect of European culture unchanged. Philosophy proved no exception: the war motivated an historically singular mobilization of philosophers to write about the war during the years of conflict; significant works of philosophy were written during the war years and immediately thereafter; the postwar decades of the 1920s and 1930s witnessed a systematic reconfiguration of the landscape of philosophical thought that still largely defines contemporary philosophy. Surprisingly, while the impact of the war on literature, poetry, and the arts, political thought has been a subject of intense inquiry and interpretation, the significance of the war for modern philosophy remains relatively unexamined, often misunderstood or simply taken for granted.

This project aims at understanding the impact of the Great War on modern philosophy. It aims to chart an original course and establish a new standard for the philosophical study of the relation between the First World War and 20th-century philosophy through a comparative and critical approach to a diverse array of thinkers. Specifically, this project will investigate the hypothesis of whether diverse philosophical responses, direct and indirect, immediately or postponed, can be understood as formulations of different questions posed, or better: catalyzed by the war itself. This project will additionally argue that the very idea that war could reveal, challenge or legitimate cultural or philosophical meaning is itself a legacy of a distinctive kind of war-philosophy produced during the war.

This project will be divided into four sub-projects: (1) ""Philosophy of War and the Wars of Philosophy,""; (2)  ""The Philosophy of Language and the Languages of Philosophy""; (3) ""The Care of the Soul""; (4) ""Europe after Europe."""</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,652,102</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Historicaldatabase"><Rcn>185631</Rcn><Nid>11376</Nid><HI>Stockholms Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>The Swedish historical database project</Name><PI>Per Einar Pettersson Lidbom</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The Swedish historical data base project will put together and make publicly available highly disaggregated data on roughly a yearly basis for about 2500 Swedish administrative districts over the period 1749-1952. The finished data set will consist of comprehensive and detailed information on economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agriculture statistics and infrastructure investments (e.g., railway construction).  The comprehensiveness and complete coverage of historical data at the local administrative level is what makes this project unique from an international perspective. Since Sweden has the longest continuous and reliable data series on population and vital statistics in the world,starting as early as 1749, makes it possible to construct a comprehensive panel data set over all 2,500 Swedish local administrative units covering a 200 year period. Consequently, the total number of observations for each variable can be as large as 0.5 million (N=2500&#195;&#151;T=200). With this type of rich and disaggregated historical data it become possible to get a better understanding of economic growth, structural transformation and economic development. Also, within-country variation allows for more satisfying empirical identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities or difference-in-differences estimation. As a case in point, I have demonstrated the potential usefulness of the Swedish historical data by addressing the question of whether redistribution of resources towards the poor differs between types of democracy after democratization. The identification strategy is based on a regression-discontinuity design where the type of democracy partly is a function of population size.

Whereas exclusivity is conventionally considered as the core element and purpose of property right, sharing and collectively using resources, either tangible or intellectual, is an increasing practice and a new field of research in the legal, sociological, cultural and economic academy. From public domain in copyright, the open access or copyleft licensing to the multiple and complex authorship resulting from online wiki creation and new forms of cohousing based on common spaces and property, all rely on the lack or limitation of exclusive rights and the accommodation of symmetric entitlements of other individuals. All share a sense of &#226;&#128;&#152;inclusivity&#226;&#128;&#153; that can be defined by (1) the absence of a power to exclude others, which leads to inclusion of others in the use and (2) the collectiveness and interdependency of privileges to use a resource. Yet, no legal tool is available to comprehend such inclusivity, but the notion of &#226;&#128;&#152;commons&#226;&#128;&#153; devoid of any normative content. The INCLUSIVE project will study allocation of resources grounded on inclusivity and the issues raised by such legal vacuum or inadequate application of exclusivity-based rules. INCLUSIVE will elaborate a legal model of &#226;&#128;&#152;inclusive right&#226;&#128;&#153; allowing for organised collectiveness, enforceability and sustainability and assess its applicability in selected fields. Instead of forcing exclusive rights on situations organised around inclusivity, the project radically innovates by rethinking the categories of legal interests, with new conceptual and methodological frameworks and adapted normative criteria. This legal concept could have discrete applications and play a role in two major challenges of our times: the sustainability of natural or informational resources and the connected agency of individuals in the digital environment."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,361,382</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INDIRECT"><Rcn>185679</Rcn><Nid>12033</Nid><HI>Turun Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Intergenerational Cumulative Disadvantage and Resource Compensation</Name><PI>Jani Petteri Erola</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The previous literature has not been able to successfully explain why the loss of the certain family resources does not show as a weaker attainment. Neither the country differences in socioeconomic inheritance seem to reflect the institutional differences between them. We argue that these problems have followed from ignoring resource compensation. The lost capital (economic, human/cultural or social) may be replaced with the other types or with the resources of someone else (the new or extended family members or neighbors). European and other developed societies can be distinguished by their abilities to influence the compensation of the loss of the parental resources rather than by their direct impact on inheritance.

We study compensation in three analytic contexts:
1) Life-course changes followed by the loss of parental resources. The specific events to be considered are parental bereavement, separation, unemployment and geographical mobility.
2) Period changes in society reducing resources in many families approximately at the same time. The examples to be analyzed are economic recession, the inflation of educational credentials due to increasing overall level of education and changing family structures and family formation processes.
3) Structural disadvantage associated with lower level of parental resources. The forms of inequality to be analyzed include the number of siblings sharing the parental resources and childhood neighborhood and the compensation of low resources with the resources of the parents of the spouse.

We use high level Finnish register panel data to analyze the loss compensation after specific life course events. The results are compared to those acquired from German SOEP data and US-based PSID data. Multiple country comparisons are conducted using ESS. The project combines three novel analytic approaches: sibling correlation methods, conditional multinomial (event history) models and sequence analysis."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,880,328</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InfoAsymMarkets"><Rcn>185620</Rcn><Nid>10041</Nid><HI>Collegio Carlo Alberto - Centro Di Ricerca E Alta Formazione, Italy</HI><Name>Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries</Name><PI>Donato (Dino) Gerardi</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>The goal of this proposal is to advance the theory of decentralized trade with informational asymmetries and limited commitment.
In most trading situations, some of the parties possess superior information about critical aspects of the environment. For example, in financial markets, professional investors are better informed about the quality of the assets that they sell to individuals. Similarly, consumers typically have private information about their willingness to pay for goods and services. It is well understood that informational asymmetries are responsible for one of the most serious forms of market inefficiency. Because of its strong assumptions in term of commitment, the standard theory of mechanism design is unsuitable for the study of many actual trading institutions. On the other hand, the focus of most of the existing literature on trading with limited commitment is the case in which the parties can trade at most once. While satisfactory in situations like the sale of a house, this assumption leaves out many important economic environments where the parties trade repeatedly over time. However, repeated transactions are natural both when the objects of trade are non-durable (e.g., services such as phone or internet plans) and when they are durable but divisible (e.g., financial assets). A crucial difference between these cases and those analyzed in the literature is the fact that the information revealed in early transactions may affect the outcome of future negotiations.
We plan to provide a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries. Our investigation will shed light on the properties of various commonly used trading mechanisms and will inform us about possible remedies to make them more efficient. This will contribute substantially to the design of adequate institutions and to the regulation of markets.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>827,410</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="JAXPERTISE"><Rcn>191231</Rcn><Nid>10606</Nid><HI>Kozep-Europai Egyetem, Hungary</HI><Name>Joint action expertise: Behavioral, cognitive, and neural mechanisms for joint action learning</Name><PI>Natalie Sebanz</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Human life is full of joint action and our achievements are, to a large extent, joint achievements that require the coordination of two or more individuals. Piano duets and tangos, but also complex technical and medical operations rely on and exist because of coordinated actions. In recent years, research has begun to identify the basic mechanisms of joint action. This work focused on simple tasks that can be performed together without practice. However, a striking aspect of human joint action is the expertise interaction partners acquire together. How people acquire joint expertise is still poorly understood. JAXPERTISE will break new ground by identifying the behavioural, cognitive, and neural mechanisms underlying the learning of joint action. Participating in joint activities is also a motor for individual development. Although this has long been recognized, the mechanisms underlying individual learning through engagement in joint activities remain to be spelled out from a cognitive science perspective. JAXPERTISE will make this crucial step by investigating how joint action affects source memory, semantic memory, and individual skill learning. Carefully designed experiments will optimize the balance between capturing relevant interpersonal phenomena and maximizing experimental control. The proposed studies employ behavioural measures, electroencephalography, and physiological measures. Studies tracing learning processes in novices will be complemented by studies analyzing expert performance in music and dance. New approaches, such as training participants to regulate each other&#226;&#128;&#153;s brain activity, will lead to methodological breakthroughs. JAXPERTISE will generate basic scientific knowledge that will be relevant to a large number of different disciplines in the social sciences, cognitive sciences, and humanities.

Recently, scholarship has turned to a new research agenda less focused on conflict: the examination of the Romanness of the Jews who lived in the Roman empire, and, in particular, that of the Palestinian Rabbis. While this new trend is both welcome and necessary in order to balance previous approaches, it still leaves an essential question unanswered, perhaps the great impens&#195;&#169; of the encounter between Jews and Romans. Beyond Roman concrete political decisions concerning Jews, and the Jews&#226;&#128;&#153; adoption of Roman cultural features such as baths, how did Roman imperialism affect the ways Judaism &#226;&#128;&#147; both rabbinic and non-rabbinic &#226;&#128;&#147; defined itself?
This project shall answer this question by analyzing an overlooked dimension of the problem. It will examine how Roman imperialism challenged Judaism both religiously and politically because of the rivalry &#226;&#128;&#147; from the Jewish perspective &#226;&#128;&#147; between Jewish and Roman universalisms and &#226;&#128;&#156;messianic&#226;&#128;&#157; ideals. This analysis shall make it possible to assess how the Jewish encounter with Rome contributed to shaping Judaism itself, in particular regarding sensitive issues such as the integration of non-Jews in Jewish society, the Jews&#226;&#128;&#153; conception of Jewish Law as a national and/or universal law, and Israel&#226;&#128;&#153;s role in the establishment of a just universal political order. Moreover, in order to better comprehend the specificity of the Jewish responses to Rome, this study shall compare them to those of the Greeks and other peoples dominated by Rome, as well as to those of the Christians until the beginning of the fourth century CE. Finally, it shall try to assess the impact of the Christianization of the empire on the changes within Judaism that began with its encounter with &#226;&#128;&#156;pagan&#226;&#128;&#157; Rome.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,433,123</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="KNOWING"><Rcn>192291</Rcn><Nid>13225</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Epistemic intersections in early modern England: the place of literature</Name><PI>Subha Mukherji</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project uncovers the interface between imaginative literature and epistemology in its wider sense in early modern England (1500-1700). This period of intense literary production also saw the cultural forces of humanism and the Reformation collide; crucial shifts in the law; scientific advancement; and dramatic expansion in trade and travel. At stake across the board was knowledge: its theories and technologies, its excitements and anxieties. We examine intersections between literary forms and apparently disparate areas of thinking about ways of knowing:
&#226;&#128;&#162; theology
&#226;&#128;&#162; natural philosophy
&#226;&#128;&#162; economic thinking
&#226;&#128;&#162; law
Subsequent disciplinary segregation has obscured the understood relations among these disciplines: epistemic transactions vital to the experiences of knowledge and belief which so deeply vexed and shaped the period&#226;&#128;&#153;s thought.

Our quarry is the specific intervention of literary texts in this conversation. What does literature know, or tell us, that other discourses cannot, or do not, because of their disciplinary investments? What aspirations to objectivity or assurance will it not share with science, religion or the law? How does it complicate economic ideas of insurance by translating them to affective notions of risk and surety? And how do these cognate practices engage with literary constitutions of knowledge? To recover the multiple frame against which this culture articulates its conceptions of knowledge, we read these fields as coeval but distinct. Across the five years, we use two thematic foci to explore and institutionalise the blind spots of knowledge, thereby rewriting the story of early modern epistemology:
i) knowing and knowingness;
ii) doubt and unknowing

To grasp the dialogic relations, we must harness specialist expertise in each discipline.

While we have gained enormous insights into the localization of language in the brain and the temporal sequence of language processes (e.g., syntactic vs. semantic), we know very little about the actual computations underlying language processing. I propose that the framework of predictive coding can fill this gap. Predictive coding is a fundamental theory of sensory processing in the brain that has recently gained enormous attention in psychology and neuroscience. While models of language assume a bottom-up driven processing stream from sensory areas through different linguistic processing stages (e.g., phonetic, syntactic) towards semantic interpretation, predictive coding postulates that high-level brain systems actively construct models of the external world and pass resulting predictions about upcoming events to lower sensory systems. Only if predictions are violated, a prediction error is signalled in a bottom-up fashion to higher areas where internal models are adjusted to minimize prediction error. Here, I postulate that language-processing is the result of multiple overlapping predictions from different sources of linguistic information, if available. I propose a research program that (a) explores the presence of neurophysiological markers of predictive coding during language processing, (b) tests quantitative hypotheses from predictive coding concerning strength and precision of prediction error signals, for established language effects, and (c) explores the domain generality of identified mechanisms. To this end, established electrophysiological and brain activation markers of sentence processing will be combined with advanced model-based data analysis tools. Finally, a comprehensive functional architecture of language shall be established that incorporates dynamically reconfigurable feedforward and feedback information flow in the language system."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,552,740</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LATTAL"><Rcn>188645</Rcn><Nid>10644</Nid><HI>Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Spain</HI><Name>The Latin Talmud and its Influence on Christian-Jewish Polemic</Name><PI>Alexander Fidora</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH5, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"While polemics and dialogue between Judaism and Christianity are as old as the Christian religion itself, one can clearly distinguish different periods, trends and intensities in the relations between the faiths. A significant landmark in this long and complex history is the Latin translation of large sections of the Talmud, the most important Jewish post-biblical text and the basis for the development of Rabbinic Judaism.
When during the 13th century Christian theologians started to examine and translate the Talmud from Hebrew and Aramaic into Latin, they were faced with a huge body of texts which represented centuries of legalistic and homiletic materials. The discovery of this immense post-biblical Jewish literature became a source of fascination for Christians who believed that this text, which encompasses every aspect of Jewish life, was fundamental both for refuting the Jewish faith and for substantiating the truth of Christianity. This realization heralded a rethinking of the place of Jews in Christian society and redefined Christian-Jewish dialogue and polemic.
The purpose of our project is to edit and publish the largest extant collection of Talmudic passages translated from Hebrew into Latin, that is, the ""Extractiones de Talmud"", while studying this ground-breaking document in the context of the trial and burning of the Talmud in 1240-42 and its aftermath.
This project addresses vital questions of Jewish and Christian identity, still relevant to the 21st century, and can only be carried out by a transdisciplinary research team including specialists from Latin Philology, Hebrew Studies and History."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,292,700</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MEMOPHI"><Rcn>185571</Rcn><Nid>12341</Nid><HI>Albert-Ludwigs-Universitaet Freiburg, Germany</HI><Name>Medieval Philosophy in Modern History of Philosophy</Name><PI>Catherine K&#195;&#182;nig</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"MEMOPHI plans the first comprehensive study of how eighteenth- and nineteenth-century historians of philosophy reconstructed medieval thought. Associating intellectual and cultural approaches, it investigates to what ends and how the history of medieval philosophy has been written, used and institutionalised in European institutions of knowledge. In the 18th and 19th centuries, history and philosophy were at the center of the scientific endeavour. Philosophy gave itself a history in the scientific sense of the word, and the scientific practice of philosophy was secularized in the new academies and universities. Writing the history of philosophy was a process of introspection and discrimination, putting into play the self-conception of the discipline. In this context, the Middle Ages occupied a central place: the first university was founded around 1200 and institutionalized the future practices of Western science. The scholastic Middle Ages and the modern period constitute indeed the two inaugural moments in the history of university thought. Modern historians of philosophy reconstructed, evaluated and criticized the scientific practices of medieval authors whom they considered as medieval &#226;&#128;&#156;philosophers&#226;&#128;&#157; and thus as the first university philosophers. Furthermore, these modern reconstructions of medieval philosophy distinguished and described various medieval &#226;&#128;&#156;cultures&#226;&#128;&#157; &#226;&#128;&#147; Jewish, Arabic, Christian, etc. &#226;&#128;&#147; for the purposes of defining the cultural identity of modern Europe and of European nations. In a broader context MEMOPHI addresses the intersection between cultural politics (notably the creations of national cultural identities) and reconstructions of philosophy&#226;&#128;&#153;s past.

The new framework will address the mechanisms at the root of the financial crisis and its propagation to real economic activity and at the same time study the appropriate policy responses and the forthcoming exit strategies. The second objective aims at extending the analyses of optimal monetary policy to abnormal times where deleveraging or liquidity shocks bring the nominal interest rate to the zero lower bound and more unconventional policies are needed. The third objective is directed to study open-economy models where the liquidity properties of financial securities affect the conduct of monetary policy, as in a currency area in which sovereign debt of some countries loses its safe-asset status or in small open economies challenged by imperfect credibility in the domestic fiat-money system."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>837,680</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MULTISENSE"><Rcn>192091</Rcn><Nid>10018</Nid><HI>University Of Sussex, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Lifespan Development of Typical and Atypical Multisensory Perception</Name><PI>Julia Claire Simner</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Daily life confronts us with information across multiple senses in parallel and we must somehow unite these sensations into a coherent interpretation of the world. MULTISENSE will explain how the human brain comes to develop this complex ability, and how certain genetically &#226;&#128;&#152;pre-marked&#226;&#128;&#153; brains can come to experience multisensory integration in remarkable ways. Implicit associations across the senses can have a profound and sometimes surprising effect on our experiences (eg, the  taste of food can be altered simply by changing its colour, its shape, or even its name). People with the neurological condition synaesthesia have cross-sensory interactions to an extreme degree (eg, they might experience tastes as colourful moving shapes in the visual field). Synaesthesia can give profound insights into normal perception because all people experience crossed sensations to an implicit degree, and often in ways that mimic synaesthetes (eg, rougher textures tend to be &#226;&#128;&#152;seen&#226;&#128;&#153; as darker colours by synaesthetes, and are also paired to darker colours by nonsynaesthetes in sensory matching tasks). In this ambitious proposal I will examine the life-span development of multisensory integration in both synaesthetes and nonsynaesthetes, considering changes that occur throughout childhood, non-elderly adulthood, and older age. My project will unfold over 48 months across 4 inter-related Work Programmes, in which I will develop a state-of-the-art assessment tool to identify child synaesthetes, and use cognitive tests and experimental techniques to evaluate multisensory functions in synaesthetes and nonsynaesthetes across the lifespan. My questions stand at the frontier of our scientific understanding, and will develop an embryonic field of childhood synaesthesia research, and forge a wholly novel field in synaesthesia and aging. My findings will be fed back to both researchers and educational policy makers, and will frame this field for current and future academics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,314,131</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MacroColl"><Rcn>185603</Rcn><Nid>10747</Nid><HI>Centre De Recerca En Economia Internacional (Crei), Spain</HI><Name>The Macroeconomics of Collateral</Name><PI>Alberto Miguel Martin</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Financial markets constitute the backbone of modern economies, intermediating resources from those who have them (i.e., lenders) to those who can put them to productive use (i.e., borrowers). The defining feature of these markets is that they entail the exchange of goods today for a borrower&#226;&#128;&#153;s promise to deliver goods in the future. These promises are sustained by guarantees, which are akin to the amount of future income that borrowers can credibly pledge to lenders. I refer to this pledgeable income as an economy&#226;&#128;&#153;s stock of collateral. This stock determines the amount and type of promises that can be traded in an economy and, in turn, this set of promises determines the transactions that can be carried out. Intuitively, when this set of promises is large, resources find their most productive uses and efficiency is high.
This raises a general question: what are the key determinants of the set of promises that an economy is able to sustain, and why does it vary?
In macroeconomic models, it is commonly assumed that all promises are backed by only one kind of collateral, i.e. usually that of private borrowers, and that this collateral is &#226;&#128;&#152;fundamental&#226;&#128;&#153;, i.e. it consists of output. Real-world financial markets, however, rely on many types of collateral to guarantee promises. In this proposal, I focus on three such types. First, collateral may be &#226;&#128;&#152;bubbly&#226;&#128;&#153;, i.e. promises can be backed by nothing else but the income that the sale of new promises is expected to bring in the future. Second, collateral need not be private, as government promises are sustained by pledging public income. Third, collateral need not be homogenous, as it may differ in quality or type across entrepreneurs, and this quality may not be perfectly observed by all. I address the following broad questions. How do economies produce these different types of collateral? How do they interact with one another? Is there a role for policy in maintaining the efficient level and composition of collateral?</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>979,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NAMO"><Rcn>191992</Rcn><Nid>13163</Nid><HI>Uniwersytet Im.

While source criticism and historicism have today become key parts of historical consciousness in Asia, Asian historical representations are nonetheless firmly embedded in pre-modern Asian literary traditions via specific uses in historical writing of traditional rhetorical structures of narrative, emplotment, tropes, and literary imagery.
Taking such linkage between present and past Asian traditions of historiography as its premise, project NAMO &#226;&#128;&#147; with four team members consisting of the PI and three Postdocs &#226;&#128;&#147; will examine the literary features of Asian historiography in India, China, and Tibet across the longue dur&#195;&#169;e of the classical, medieval, and modern periods. First, a new method for the study of the literary forms that characterize historiography in Asia will be established by adapting basic analytical principles from Asian literary theories drawn from twelve classical Indian and Chinese works on poetics. Next, the team will determine the specific literary characteristics of narrative, plot, tropes, and historical explanation found in seventeen classical and medieval histories composed in China, India, and Tibet. Finally, it will be examined to which extent those traditional literary features still function as constitutive rhetorical elements in modern Asian history writing. This will be done by analyzing the literary forms used in a selection of twenty representative histories written in the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India during the period 1980-2010.
The outcome will be a novel approach for the empirical study of Asian history that will open up a new level of comparative work in the theory of history across non-Western and Western traditions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,162</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NOMADICEMPIRES"><Rcn>185570</Rcn><Nid>11973</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Nomadic Empires: A World-Historical Perspective</Name><PI>Pekka Johannes H&#195;&#164;m&#195;&#164;l&#195;&#164;inen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project provides a wide-ranging and inclusive reinterpretation of the history of equestrian nomadic empires from the fourth century BCE to the late nineteenth century CE. The project has four major objectives that are interrelated. First, it expands the scope of the research significantly by extending it beyond the better known Eurasian nomadic empires into the Americas, where new research has revealed&#226;&#128;&#148;and may yet reveal&#226;&#128;&#148;previously unidentified nomadic empires. The project also re-examines the 7th-century expansion of the Arab Bedouins as an expression of nomadic imperial formation. Second, the project seeks to untangle the study of nomadic empires from normative and mechanistic models by developing new conceptual avenues that allow us to examine nomadic empires on their own cultural terms. It re-examines the intersections among mobility, expansion, exploitation, incorporation and dominance by reorienting research toward a new set of heuristic avenues: the nodal spatial composition of nomadic regimes, the centrality of borderlands in imperial formation, and a notion of nomadic empires as kinetic empires that turned mobility into an imperial strategy. Third, the project breaks new methodological ground by showing how innovative and underused approaches&#226;&#128;&#148;integration of environmental and imperial histories; blending of multiple analytical scales to reveal the socio-political complexity of nomadic societies; and a specific spatial reorientation in which developments are viewed holistically from nomadic domains outward&#226;&#128;&#148;produce a broader and more nuanced understanding of the emergence, behaviour and historical influences of nomadic empires. Such approaches will uncover a range of different nomadic empires across the world over a vast time span. The fourth objective of the project is to represent and explain those empires as a multifaceted world-shaping phenomenon through process-oriented comparisons that focus on imperial dynamics rather than imperial types.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,584</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NORMCOMMIT"><Rcn>192055</Rcn><Nid>10024</Nid><HI>Fondation Jean-Jacques Laffont,toulouse Sciences Economiques, France</HI><Name>Origins and Effects of Normative Commitments</Name><PI>Daniel Li Chen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>A debate in the development of legal institutions is whether individuals obey the law because the law incentivizes or because the law has legitimacy.  Much of the PI&#226;&#128;&#153;s research in law and in development seeks to understand how people form normative commitments, i.e., what people view as the moral and right thing to do, and how they respond to these normative commitments.  His work traces the incentives that lead to human rights violations.  The PI has examined how interpretations of religious and legal texts, particularly those associated with fundamentalism, interact with market forces.  In two multi-part studies, the PI investigated the economic forces underlying the religious provision of social insurance, social sanctions, social conservatism, and the economic incentives that give rise to gender violence, sexual harassment, and regulation of the private domain.  Through these investigations, the PI formulated a theory for why church-state separation arose in some countries but not in others, developed a methodology for empirically evaluating the effects of normative commitments, and used a particular instance of interpretive injustice where capital cases in the British Army during World War I were randomly executed or commuted, in order to estimate the deterrent and delegitimizing effects of the death penalty. The proposed project builds on this previous work. The proposal rests on 2 pillars: Normative Commitments in Health Care and Normative Commitments in Courts.  Within these 2 pillars, the PI studies the effects of market forces on normative commitments and examines how normative commitments come into existence in the first place.  (1) Normative Commitments in Health Care: The PI will measure the influence of pharmaceutical company payments to physicians on their normative commitments. This pillar will evaluate the effects of payments on physician prescriptions and patient outcomes. The pillar will examine whether disclosure laws affect the relationship between payments, prescriptions, and patient outcomes. The pillar will employ a unique U.S. dataset on over 2 billion prescription claims per year on up to 177 million individuals and a Danish database of all prescription drugs sold linked to prescribers with pharmaceutical associations. (2) Normative Commitments in Courts: This pillar will use the random assignment of judges in common law courts to measure the impact of exogenous changes in legal precedent. The pillar will apply a method co-developed by the PI for two-stage least squares estimation (Econometrica (80(6), 2369-2429, 2012) that exploits judicial characteristics as instrumental variables. The pillar will study the effects of 24 legal areas, including capital punishment, free speech, gay rights, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and rights of the disabled.  The pillar will use this data to study the origin of rights.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,591,939</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Networks"><Rcn>185629</Rcn><Nid>12013</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; D'aix-Marseille, France</HI><Name>Markets and Networks</Name><PI>Yann Bramoull&#195;&#169;</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Economists are becoming increasingly aware of the importance and ubiquity of social networks. The economics of social networks constitutes one of the most active areas of research in economics. Despite much progress, however, our understanding of the relationships between markets and networks is still poor and fragmentary. This project will advance the state of the art by analyzing the relations between markets and networks in two domains.

I will first study theoretically the interaction between formal insurance and networks of informal insurance. I will analyze how the position in a risk-sharing network affects the incentives to adopt formal insurance, how network structure affects overall adoption, how formal insurance could benefit from network monitoring on efforts and whether the adoption of formal insurance strengthen or weaken the risk-sharing network. Second, I will study theoretically the impact of networks on markets with search frictions. I will derive the full-fledged equilibrium implications of network-based search in matching models of the labor market. I will also introduce recall in a finite-horizon matching model and study the impact of the emerging network of trading partners.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>481,087</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="P-CYCLES"><Rcn>185543</Rcn><Nid>11971</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Perceptual Cycles: Exploring and controlling the perceptual consequences of brain rhythms</Name><PI>Rufin Bernard Edmond Vanrullen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Many current theories implicate brain oscillations in perception, attention, consciousness or memory. This, however, has one critical implication that is often overlooked in cognitive sciences: if a perceptual function relies on an oscillatory basis, then it should operate periodically, as a sequence of successive episodes or 'snapshots', with more or less favourable moments recurring at a well-defined periodicity. The present project aims to explore the validity and the consequences of this groundbreaking notion of ""rhythmic perception"". Whereas current research links perceptual functions to relatively slow changes of oscillatory amplitude, we propose to investigate the perceptual consequences of brain rhythms at the rapid time scale of the oscillatory cycle &#226;&#128;&#147;the notion of ""perceptual cycles"". In work-package (WP) 1, we will explore the range of perceptual and cognitive operations that depend on oscillatory neural implementations, and reveal their cyclic behaviour. In WP2, we will relate these perceptual and cognitive cycles to the underlying neural activities by means of brain imaging techniques (EEG, fMRI, TMS); a key innovation is a proposed novel fMRI method to visualize the spatio-temporal propagation of perceptual cycles. In WP3, we will utilize this knowledge to control the power, frequency and phase of perceptual rhythms and thus dynamically manipulate, improve or prevent perception. In WP4, we will bridge the gap between lower- and higher-frequency perceptual cycles (from ~2 to ~100Hz) by experimental studies of cross-frequency coupling and computational models of visual information multiplexing. The project as a whole will characterize the rhythmic dynamics of perception, their neural basis and their functional implications, bringing us closer to understanding perception itself. The idea that sensory perception and cognition might follow a succession of snapshots rather than a continuous stream could spark a major transformation in cognitive sciences."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,860,672</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PALEOPLANT"><Rcn>185568</Rcn><Nid>12342</Nid><HI>Universidad Del Pais Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Spain</HI><Name>Palaeolithic Plant Use in the Western Mediterranean</Name><PI>Lydia Zapata</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project deals with one of the big gaps of knowledge in prehistory, how plant foods and resources were used by preagrarian societies. Plants have been fundamental for human societies across the planet. However, it is a blank when it comes to archaeological evidence of humans eating and exploiting them during most part of Prehistory. This work aims at changing the meat/hunting centred paradigm of Palaeolithic subsistence by readdressing human plant exploitation through a novel interdisciplinary approach. The main objectives are: 1) To assess wild plant exploitation among Palaeolithic-Epipalaeolithic societies, 2) To appraise resilience and change in Palaeolithic-Epipalaeolithic plant use, and 3) To improve archaeological methodology and fieldwork. The chronology of analysis &#226;&#128;&#147;from the Late Middle Palaeolithic to the Epipalaeolithic- includes two extremely interesting periods: a) the transition from the middle to the upper Palaeolithic with neanderthal extinction and early presence of modern humans which gives us the opportunity to explore and compare whether these groups exploit plant resources in a different way, and b) the climatic change from the Late Pleistocene to the early Holocene which allows to evaluate how last hunter-gatherers from the region adapt to climatic change and new ecological conditions. The challenge of the work is to obtain archaeological visibility of plant use through and interdisciplinary approach that combines: pollen analysis, the study of plant macroremains including underground storage organs (USOs), micromorphology, analysis of microremains such as phytoliths and starch, ethnobotany and use-wear analyses on tools. The different types of evidence to be analysed come from relevant archaeological sites from Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

Performance art shall not only be presented as an object of study, but also as a central art genre implicitly and explicitly involved both in the investigation of cultural practices and in the creation of alternative ways of action. The project focuses, for one, on the artistic exploration of totalitarian or real-socialist practices, rituals, and gestures, but also on artistic ways of action developed in the course of underground activity. Eastern European performance art came to life under conditions in which it was from the very start considered as dubious both aesthetically and contentwise. However, tolerance, hindrance, and sometimes even prohibition led to a heightened degree of self-reflection, minimalism, abstraction, and analysis; in other words, to characteristics representative of the specificity of East European performance art between 1950 and 1990.
At the same time, the proposed project is to be understood as an archaeological one, for it sets out to reconstruct correlations and interactions between unofficial artistic production and official cultural practice. Moreover, it aims to make available to a broader public artistic endeavours that until now could not be centred on in research fields like art history, theatre-, and cultural studies in an Eastern European context.

The project will concentrate on the following four research areas:
1. Territorial interrelationships (between the Eastern European countries, between East and West)
2. Specificity of practice in Eastern European performance art (subversive affirmation, minimalism, abstraction)
3. Interrelationships between artistic action and political activism in the underground

Developing means for preserving and restoring cognitive functioning in old age is therefore of great importance. Age-related cognitive impairments have a complex and multifactorial etiology. Pharmaceutical approaches to prevention and treatment have therefore been unsuccessful, and searching for non-pharmaceutical approaches is important. Results of cognitive training studies have so far been disappointing. I hypothesize that the reason for this is that plasticity is functionally inhibited after normal childhood development. Plasticity is then further reduced in aging due to negative brain changes. In this sense, past studies on the effects of cognitive training in adulthood and old age have, so to speak, attempted to push a car that has the brakes on. In a series of experimental studies on humans, my research team will discover feasible ways to release inhibitory brakes on adult plasticity, develop routes to attenuate age-related negative effects on plasticity, and uncover the neural mediators of training-related change in performance, so that the effects of cognitive training can be increased and better understood. Outcome variables include measures of brain function, volume, and integrity acquired using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, and up-to-date measures of cognitive performance.

By exploring the phenomenon of early modern literary reception in a rigorous and comprehensive way, the project will allow us to see more clearly the importance and function of reception; specifically how the field of reception articulates and develops critical and aesthetic engagements, how it reveals the extent to which gender shapes ideas about authorship, and how it historicizes our current debates about intellectual impact and gender. Existing reception scholarship has focused on qualitative case studies and tended to prioritize print culture; the field requires a quantitative approach that takes full account of the realities of textual transmission in a period when manuscript circulation retained its broad appeal. RECIRC overcomes the logistical challenges by focusing on the category of the manuscript miscellany and on networks as centres of textual circulation, producing new knowledge about transmission and book ownership. The project will test the hypothesis that the attribution of texts to anonymous, pseudonymous and gender-designated authors is revelatory regarding how gender determined reception.
RECIRC&#226;&#128;&#153;s specific objectives are: to challenge assumptions that women&#226;&#128;&#153;s penetration of the literary field in this period was limited by focusing on textual reception rather than production; to transform current thinking on the nature of impact and the quality of reception by classifying and analysing the modes of textual engagement in new ways; to provoke a new understanding of the invention of the author in this period by approaching the question via reception, grounding it in a gendered understanding of the complex constructions of authorship that includes the exploitation of anonymity and pseudonymity; and to advance current discourses about scholarly impact by opening up and critiquing their historical contexts."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,823,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RaceFaceID"><Rcn>192057</Rcn><Nid>10016</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Race Matter: On the Absent Presence of Race in Forensic Identification</Name><PI>Aouatef Amade M'charek</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This ethnographic project on race in forensic practice aims to study how technologies of identification shape race. The focus is on &#226;&#128;&#152;face-making&#226;&#128;&#153; in forensic identification; i.e. the reconstruction of faces of unknown persons, a practice entwined with &#226;&#128;&#152;race-making&#226;&#128;&#153;.

In five subprojects the study investigates: How technologies of facial identification in and outside laboratories enact race (subprojects 1-3); How versions of race change as knowledge moves across sites (subproject 4); The mechanism through which race becomes an absent present object, i.e. an object that appears to the surface, e.g. in discourse, to then go underground to hide in the routines and technologies of science, e.g. in genetic markers (subproject 5).

The overall objective of this interdisciplinary project is to develop theoretical concepts and methods to grasp the absent present object race. The project goes beyond the social constructivist paradigm, by taking the biological into account. It attends to the materiality of race, i.e. the ways race is shaped as a set of relations between the biological, the social and the technical.

This project is innovative in several ways. It is the first to comprehensively study race and forensics, a highly relevant field where knowledge circulates constantly between science and society. The ethnographic subprojects are innovative in the way they compare frontier science of genetics to every day practices, such as facial composite drawings and skull-based reconstructions. Because of its focus on race-in-practice, this project will make a major contribution to the social sciences by providing tools to theorize the materiality of race. Finally, this innovative project comprises a multi-sited ethnography that follows routes of knowledge into and out of the laboratory to various sites in society.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,935</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Roads"><Rcn>192571</Rcn><Nid>13418</Nid><HI>School Of Oriental And African Studies, University Of London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Roads and the politics of thought: Ethnographic approaches to infrastructure development in South Asia</Name><PI>Edward Simpson</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>New roads are being constructed at unprecedented rates in certain parts of the world.

As cheap oil dwindles and questions of climate change remain, why are so many international institutions cultivating new roads?

The project will provide the first ethnographic account of the culture of road builders, their knowledge practices, inter-relations and motivations. The research will be rooted in case studies of particular road projects in Pakistan, India, Maldives and Sri Lanka. These sites have been selected to bring to the fore how nation-building, neo-liberalism, ambition, environmental vulnerability and modernity feature in contemporary road-building. We will look at the organisation of road building on the ground, in offices, and within a broader array of institutions and state bodies in national and international contexts in order to understand the global cultures of road-building practice.

The project is academic in design and will contribute to various pressing and critical debates relating to power, global justice and environmental futures. The subject also merits wider discussion and at the core of the research design is an innovative collaboration between anthropologists and leading contemporary artists.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,159</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SECURE"><Rcn>188665</Rcn><Nid>12216</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>"Securing Europe, Fighting its Enemies: The making of a security culture in Europe and beyond, 1815-1914"</Name><PI>Beatrice Albertha De Graaf</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project examines the development of a European security culture as the sum of mutually shared perceptions on &#226;&#128;&#156;enemies of the states,&#226;&#128;&#157; &#226;&#128;&#156;vital interests,&#226;&#128;&#157; and corresponding practices, between 1815 and 1914. By studying seven distinct instances of supranational security cooperation and their professional agents we will analyze how this European security culture emerged as early as 1815 as an open process of convergence and divergence, and of inclusion and exclusion. The team consists of the PI, 3 PhDs, 1 Post-Doc, and a research assistant.

The postulated existence of a shared European security culture in the 19th century may seem counterintuitive. Historians and scholars of international relations generally view the first half of this age through the lenses of &#226;&#128;&#156;balance of power&#226;&#128;&#157; and hegemony, and the second half as shaped by bellicose nationalism rather than collective security. European security cooperation and culture is generally situated after 1918, or 1945, as a reaction to the horrors of war and motivated by economic considerations. Nevertheless, after 1815 several concrete transnational security regimes were forged, (partly) designed to deal with &#226;&#128;&#156;enemies of the states,&#226;&#128;&#157; such as the Commissions on the Rhine and the Danube (to fight smugglers), the European Commissions on Syria and China (to fight colonial rebels), the Anti-Piracy and Anti-Anarchism Campaigns, and others. These security regimes, dictated by the threats and interests, were highly dynamic, encompassing a growing corpus of professional agents from different branches (police, judicial, military), and evolving from military interventions into police and judicial regimes. They were midwife to a veritable European security culture. This important development has not received the attention it deserves within the framework of the history of international relations and international studies.

Our hypothesis is that the development of this culture (threat/interest perceptions and practices) was dependent on four determinants: 1) the quality of the epistemic community (agents), 2) their threat/interest demarcations (subject/object), 3) the level of juridification and the use of military/police force (norms), and 4) innovations in the information, communication, and transportation technologies (technology). These determinants explain variance and change, ranging from inclusion to exclusion of groups and interests, and from juridical convergence between the European states/societies regarding the security practices in some cases to a total dissolution in other cases.

This project pioneers a new multidisciplinary approach to the combined history of international relations and internal policy, aiming to &#226;&#128;&#156;historicize security.&#226;&#128;&#157; Using new material, we are comparing seven different security regimes where Europe engaged globally, that stretched across the political and commercial domain, affected urban and maritime environments, and reached around the world to the Ottoman Empire and China."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,973,419</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SESyP"><Rcn>185544</Rcn><Nid>11379</Nid><HI>Leuphana Universitat Luneburg, Germany</HI><Name>Identifying Social-Ecological System Properties Benefiting Biodiversity and Food Security</Name><PI>J&#195;&#182;rn Fischer</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Ensuring food security and halting biodiversity decline are urgent, interconnected challenges. Drawing on the natural and social sciences, I propose an interdisciplinary research agenda to address these challenges. My goal is to develop a global theory that explains which properties of social-ecological systems benefit both biodiversity conservation and food security (and which benefit one but not the other). This holistic, systems-oriented approach radically differs from existing work: The most high-profile framing at present focuses on the question how to increase agricultural yields without compromising biodiversity. By contrast, a systems-oriented approach recognizes yield as just one variable alongside others that also influence biodiversity and food security. I will use a multi-scale approach that balances the likely trade-offs between depth and generality. Using a specifically developed typology of social-ecological system properties, I will investigate rural landscapes as social-ecological systems at three levels of detail. First, drawing on expert knowledge, I will develop a global database of at least 50 relevant systems, relating general system properties to indicators of food security and biodiversity. Second, I will conduct in-depth workshops on 15-20 social-ecological systems worldwide to reveal in more detail the causal linkages between system properties, food security and biodiversity. Third, I will conduct an in-depth empirical case study on food security and biodiversity in Ethiopia. This will complement the other components by highlighting the nature of potentially important regional subtleties. My multi-scale approach effectively combines high ambition and high feasibility. SESyP will produce new tools and a holistic theory of relevance to researchers, policy makers, supra-national bodies and non-governmental organizations worldwide.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,788,724</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SHARP"><Rcn>185542</Rcn><Nid>11966</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences</Name><PI>Laurens Julien Henri Cherchye</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Household consumption (including labor supply) is usually the outcome of a complex interaction between multiple household members. Understanding this consumption behavior requires non-unitary modeling of households, which recognizes that households are not single decision units but consist of interacting individuals. This project builds a powerful toolkit for empirical analysis of household consumption through structural models of individual preferences and within-household interactions. It opens the &#226;&#128;&#156;intrahousehold black box&#226;&#128;&#157; while only using the (limited) consumption information observed at the aggregate household level.

In particular, I develop a revealed preference methodology that is intrinsically nonparametric. This method (only) uses preference information that is directly revealed by the observed consumption choices. It avoids confounding the analysis by imposing (nonverifiable) parametric/functional structure on within-household decision processes. My main contribution is twofold:
1. At the theoretical level, I integrate marriage market dynamics into the structural modeling of household consumption. The marriage market defines the &#226;&#128;&#156;outside options&#226;&#128;&#157; of (adult) household members, which indirectly impacts the intrahousehold consumption allocation (e.g. through individual bargaining positions). Modeling these marriage market effects implies a better description of the intrahousehold decision process, which in turn yields a more powerful analysis of household consumption.
2. At the empirical level, I integrate revealed preference restrictions on non-unitary household consumption with nonparametric estimation of demand systems (subject to non-unitary shape restrictions on household demand). This will enhance the applicability of revealed preference methods to widely available (pooled) cross-section data sets. It also allows for addressing empirical issues such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and limited power of revealed preference restrictions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>851,581</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SNIHCY"><Rcn>191356</Rcn><Nid>10600</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Social Network Implementation of Health Campaigns Among Youth</Name><PI>Moniek Adrienne Buijzen</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"Western societies devote substantial resources to media health campaigns, especially targeting young people. Unfortunately, health campaigns often have disappointing impact. There is a compelling need for insight into campaign implementation in social life. Especially among youth, the social environment plays a crucial role in message processing. Therefore, health campaigns can only be improved with a multidisciplinary approach that can predict youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s behaviour within their social environment.

The proposed programme aims to develop a method for effective campaign implementation via youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s social networks. This method will (1) identify and target the most powerful influence agents in youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s social networks, (2) tailor campaign messages to the most effective influence mechanisms, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of social network implemented campaigns. The method will be based on the multidisciplinary Media X Social Influence (MXSI) model, integrating theories from communication, marketing, psychology, and sociology.

Five research projects focus on youth&#226;&#128;&#153;s weight-related behaviours. Drawing on a large-scale cross-sequential cohort study (N = 3,000, 9-15 y/o), the research (Phase I) tests and refines the MXSI model, identifying social influence agents and mechanisms, and (Phase II) tests the effectiveness of a social network-implemented health campaign in a group-randomised control trial, targeting the most powerful influence agents and mechanisms. The research projects use the Wearable Lab, a highly innovative smartphone-based research methodology.

The project is theoretically and methodologically pioneering and will produce a unique and useful method for improving health campaigns. Feasibility and success are guaranteed by the applicant&#226;&#128;&#153;s extensive experience and network. The applicant is one of the leading experts in the world on the role of marketing communication in youth socialisation and in translating these insights for health and prosocial purposes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,594</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SNP"><Rcn>185610</Rcn><Nid>10744</Nid><HI>London School Of Economics And Political Science, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Inference for Semi-Nonparametric Econometric Models</Name><PI>Taisuke Otsu</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This research project aims to contribute to advances in the research on semiparametric and nonparametric econometric methods by developing novel estimation and inference approaches in a variety of contexts and applying them to important empirical problems in economics.
The project is divided into four parts. The first part develops a Bayes procedure for the moment condition model. A likelihood function is constructed by employing an information theoretic projection from space of nonparametric prior distributions on data to space of distributions satisfying the moment conditions. Posterior sampling methods and asymptotic theory for the posterior are developed.
The second part focuses on the moment condition model but from a different perspective, robustness of decision methods. By focusing on local perturbations within shrinking topological neighborhoods, this part develops a framework to evaluate robustness of inference methods for the moment condition model. It is found that there is a computationally convenient method that achieves optimal minimax robust properties under local perturbations without losing asymptotic equivalence to GMM under correct specification.
The third part develops nonparametric regression techniques for extremal or tail behaviors. This part develops asymptotic theory for nonparametric quantile regression when the quantile drifts to 0 or 1 as the sample size increases. Based on the theory, a new inference method for extremal behaviors is developed.
The fourth part extends the empirical likelihood approach to a variety of empirical problems in economics. This part develops empirical likelihood inference methods for regression discontinuity designs, continuity or discontinuity of probability density functions, volatility measurement in high frequency financial data, and testing for partially identified moment inequality models. Also new concepts of nonparametric likelihood are developed by extending the likelihood theory on parametric models."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>866,454</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SOCIOGENOME"><Rcn>188670</Rcn><Nid>10636</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Unravelling the genetic influences of reproductive behaviour and gene-environment interaction</Name><PI>Melinda Mills</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH3, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project will be the first to engage in a comprehensive study of the role of genes and gene-environment (GxE) interaction on reproductive behaviour. Until now, social science research has focussed on socio-environmental explanations, largely neglecting the role of genes. Due to unprecedented advances in molecular genetics over the last two decades, for the first time in history we are able to examine whether there is a genetic component to reproductive outcomes, including age at first birth, number of children and infertility. Building on my substantive empirical research, I first develop a multifactor theoretical and measurement model isolating socio-environmental and lifestyle factors. Second, I apply the most cutting-edge techniques in genetics to examine the genetic architecture of reproductive behaviour, including: the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of reproductive choice; polygenic risk scores; and, genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). Third, I focus on gene-environment interactions (GxE) to test different mechanisms of how the environment moderates genetic influences. Fourth, I propose to use genetic markers as instrumental variables (IVs) in a bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine causality and address the endogeneity of lifestyle and education in reproductive outcomes. This transdisciplinary project will produce fundamentally different results, overturn established links and deliver major breakthroughs in fertility research and beyond. This project is not only ground breaking by setting a new research agenda, but due to the inclusion of  new genetic variables and  techniques to study the causal effects of genes and their interaction with environment, will yield major innovations useful  within demography and beyond.

When young, these risks include wage risk, unemployment risk, entrepreneurial risk, and divorce risk. When old, one risks living to a very old age and running out of assets, being hit by expensive medical needs, and losing one&#226;&#128;&#153;s spouse. An important factor affecting people&#226;&#128;&#153;s risk exposure, and hence saving behaviour, is the public insurance provided by governments. Risks and insurance influence key economic choices and affect people&#226;&#128;&#153;s welfare, macroeconomic aggregates, and inequality.
The proposed research will develop and test models of individual and household saving to a) provide novel evidence on the determinants of saving at different ages; b) better quantify the interaction of saving with the insurance provided by the government and by one&#226;&#128;&#153;s family; c) study how individual-level decisions affect macroeconomic conditions and the distribution of wealth; d) evaluate the effects of policy proposals and different institutions using quantitative model economies, calibrated to both the U.S. and European countries.
The proposed applications include studying (i) the effects of means-tested public health insurance and its reforms on single retirees. (ii) A structural model of couples&#226;&#128;&#153; savings and risks in old age. (iii) Couples&#226;&#128;&#153; savings and labour supply during their whole life cycle, including the working stage. (iv) The effects of credit shocks on the saving and hiring of small-business owners and the resulting aggregates. (v) Differences in wealth accumulation between the healthy and the unhealthy.
By better modeling and quantifying saving motives, risks, and publicly provided insurance, we can propose more efficient reforms. By applying our analysis to both the US and to European economies we can reach a better understanding of the effects of different institutions across countries.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,216,477</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SystemicRisk"><Rcn>185670</Rcn><Nid>10726</Nid><HI>London School Of Economics And Political Science, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systemic Risk and Feedback to the Real Economy</Name><PI>Zhichao Kathy Yuan</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH1, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>In this proposal I present two research themes that apply endogenous risk analysis to identify channels for the creation of systemic risk via various feedback loops. These projects identify new ways to consider and measure systemic financial risks and, more importantly, the linkages between the financial risks and the real economy, and the welfare consequences.

In the first research theme, the focus will be on the effect of network externality on systemic risk formation. I plan to model and estimate network externality using uniquely available datasets on interbank payment flows in the UK; on 176 UK banks&#226;&#128;&#153; counterparty exposure with detailed breakdown of market instruments, and on the BIS bilateral bank capital flows respectively. These analyses are important to understand the role of network in dampening or amplifying shocks and provide quantitative measurement of network-originated systemic (liquidity/default) risks. The impact of these projects is not limited to academia but also has important policy implications.

The second research theme will focus on the feedback effects and coordination that lead to excessive systemic risks. In reality, channels for systemic risks arise from unintended consequences embedded in constraints, regulations and frictions that lead to feedback loops and undesirable coordination. For example, my earlier work on feedback between the financial markets and the real economy (Ozdenoren and Yuan 2008, Goldstein, Ozdenoren and Yuan 2011, 2013) has shown that feedback through information friction channels could create excessive financial and real volatilities. In the proposal, I outline a series of projects that examine feedback channels that are related to compensation contracts of CEOs, liquidity, firesales, and regulatory features such as bailouts on excessive correlated risk-taking in the economy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>698,938</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TEMPLATE 2.0"><Rcn>185590</Rcn><Nid>11984</Nid><HI>Stichting Vu, Netherlands</HI><Name>Template 2.0: Depicting the picture in your head</Name><PI>Christian Nicolas Leon Olivers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH4, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the most important features of human vision is that it is selective. It flexibly samples the environment on the basis of what is relevant to our current tasks &#226;&#128;&#147; tasks such as driving, finding a product in the supermarket, or collecting a child from school. This means that the brain maintains some representation of what we are currently looking for, be it a traffic sign, a coffee brand, or a kid&#226;&#128;&#153;s face. This &#226;&#128;&#156;picture in your head&#226;&#128;&#157;, or &#226;&#128;&#156;template&#226;&#128;&#157; as it is often referred to, remains a huge mystery. Current models of visual exploration assume it to be there, but without making explicit what its properties and mechanisms are. The proposed program will change this. Based on a three-state model of human memory, I have identified several lines of research that collectively lead to a thorough understanding of one of the most fundamental concepts of perceptual theory. These lines systematically investigate what distinguishes the template from other types of memory, how many templates can be active at a time, how we set up, change, and abandon the template with changing task demands, and  how training changes the nature, dynamics and capacity of the template. Each of these lines builds on my extensive track record in investigating memory and attention, and combines modern psychological, brain imaging, and modeling methods with innovative experimental paradigms. The result will be a comprehensive understanding of visual selection, of what makes human perception so adaptive. As such it will carry important implications for the fields of psychology and neuroscience, as well as clinical fields. In addition, the results are of direct relevance for how humans interact with ever more intelligent information systems, thus promoting safety and efficiency of everyday life.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,995,780</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSRIGHTS"><Rcn>188668</Rcn><Nid>12220</Nid><HI>Instituto De Ciencias Sociais Da Universidade De Lisboa, Portugal</HI><Name>Gender citizenship and sexual rights in Europe: transgender lives from a transnational perspective</Name><PI>Sofia Isabel Da Costa D'aboim Inglez</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>"The TRANSRIGHTS project investigates transgender lives and the institutional apparatus that frames them. Rather than focusing exclusively on self displayed identities, four lines of inquiry will be developed.

Secondly, by comparing the lives of trans-people in five European countries &#226;&#128;&#147; Portugal, France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden &#226;&#128;&#147; we wish to attain an overview of how institutional frameworks impact on these lives. Thirdly, our approach will take into account the immigration of trans-individuals to Europe, whether in search for recognition or as a way of survival often leading to sex work. Fourthly, by comparing different countries, different groups of transgender people, different forms of attaining inclusion or dealing with exclusion, different conceptions of gender citizenship and sexual rights, we wish not only to gain a deeper understanding of societal change and its impact on the lives of transgender individuals, but also to identify the gaps between policies and rights and the categories actually mobilized for self-identification. Such a task implies examining the voices of trans-people, the effect of policies on the materiality of lives as well as conceptualizations of selfhood that do not necessarily confine to the European context. Project outputs will contribute to the fields of gender, sexuality and citizenship by providing a grounded theoretical debate, discussing the gender categories of citizenship. Trans-people are a heterogeneous group that represents one of the most challenging boundaries for framing this debate within and beyond Europe.

We propose to use both computational and neuroscientific methodologies to provide new and more accurate models of learning in interactive settings. The long-term objective is to develop a neural theory of learning: a mathematical framework that describes the computations mediating social learning in terms of neural signals, structures and plasticity. We plan to develop a model of adaptive learning based on three basic principles: (1) the observation of the outcome of un-chosen options improves the decisions taken in the learning process, (2) learning can be transferred from one domain to another, and (3) learning can be transferred from one agent to another (i.e. social learning). In all three cases, humans appear able to construct and transfer knowledge from sources other than their own direct experience, an underappreciated though we believe critical aspect of learning. Our approach will combine neural and behavioral data with computational models of learning. The hypotheses will be formalized into machine learning algorithms and neural networks of &#226;&#128;&#156;regret&#226;&#128;&#157; learning, to quantify the evolution of the learning computations on a trial-by-trial basis from the sequence of stimuli, choices and outcomes. The existence and accuracy of the predicted computations will be then tested on neural signals recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The potential findings of this project could lead us to suggest general principles of social learning, and we will be able to measure and model neural activation to show those general principles in action. In addition, our results could have important implications into policy-making - by revealing what type of information agents are naturally inclined to better learn from - and clinical practice - by outlining potential diagnostic procedures and behavioral therapies for disorders affecting social behavior.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UP-NORTH"><Rcn>192287</Rcn><Nid>13226</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>COLONISATION AND CULTURAL DIVERSIFICATION IN UNFAMILIAR LANDSCAPES</Name><PI>Rhiannon Stevens</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH6, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project explores the relationship between climate change and human behaviour. During the harshest conditions of the last ice age European human populations abandoned northern latitudes, with their range contracting to southern regions. By the time ice sheets retreated and large areas of land became available for resettlement there had been a hiatus of at least 7000 years.  This project examines the recolonisation of these Northern regions which took place during a period of rapid climate change, the last major global warming event on earth. As people move eastwards and northwards increasing diversification is seen in their stone and bone tool industries which indicate human development. This project examines whether climate a) drove the human dispersal and development, b) played a more indirect role, or c) was of little significance to humans at this time. State-of-the-art scientific techniques (radiocarbon dating, DNA, stable isotope, clumped isotope and charcoal ring width analyses) will be used to create integrated chronological, palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological frameworks that are directly linked to the Late and Final Palaeolithic archaeological record. Temporal and spatial trends in climate change, prey abundance and behaviour, and technological development will be compared and considered in light of regional and global climate trends and archaeological evidence for hunting strategies, human mobility and landscape use. Such data will provide an insight into the conditions Palaeolithic people experienced and how this influenced their perceptions of the landscape they inhabited and the decisions they made.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,510</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="iBias"><Rcn>189832</Rcn><Nid>11816</Nid><HI>Universiteit Antwerpen, Belgium</HI><Name>Understanding contemporary interest group politics: mobilization and strategies in multi-layered systems</Name><PI>Jan Beyers</PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), SH2, ERC-2013-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This ERC program addresses an unsettled political science problem, namely how does the shifting of policymaking competencies to higher levels of government affect the opportunities of societal interests to seek representation. On this issue two completely different theoretical expectations exist. One the one hand, the Madisonian view entails that shifting competencies upwards is a healthy antidote to the powers of specific interests that may dominate smaller polities. Multi-levelness may also provide political opportunities as it enables actors to make strategic venue shifts when they are unable to attract the necessary attention at one venue. On the other hand, shifting policymaking upwards may seriously restrict the opportunities for diffuse interests, undermine encompassing forms of interest representation, and increase the barriers for local groups to gain attention. Instead of creating opportunities for all, multi-layered systems may decrease opportunities and reproduce or reinforce representational bias. One of the reasons why the implications of multi-layeredness are so poorly understood is the fact that political science has not developed a proper understanding of what representational bias means; some scholars see bias in terms of mobilization, while others conceive it in terms of the strategic interactions between organized interests and policymakers.

This ERC program will integrate theoretically, methodologically and empirically these different aspects of group politics, by taking explicitly into account the nature of multi-layered systems. The innovative character of it lies in the theoretical combination of mapping interest group community dynamics, with a more nuanced characterization of organizational form and an in-depth investigation of bias in terms of strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,655,263</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="5HT-OPTOGENETICS"><Rcn>94452</Rcn><Nid>9067</Nid><HI>Fundacao D.

As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines.

Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#8217;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#8216;dual beam&#8217; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#8211;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#8211;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#8211;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

The thesis of the project is: that by careful control of the constituent nanostructure properties, a 3-dimensional medium can be created in which a large number of topological solitons can exist. Although hardly studied at all to date, these solitons should be stable at room temperature, extremely compact and easy to manipulate and propagate.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms.

Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility.

In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces.

As a final benefit, growth of thin high quality thin Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3 layers could allow for a demonstration of the (2-dimensional) quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature - offering a road map to dissipation-less transport for the semiconductor industry."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3D-E"><Rcn>107427</Rcn><Nid>10875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Engineered Environments for Regenerative Medicine</Name><PI>Ruth Elizabeth Cameron</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal develops a unified, underpinning technology to create novel, complex and biomimetic 3D environments for the control of tissue growth.  As director of Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, I have recently been approached by medical colleagues to help to solve important problems in the separate therapeutic areas of breast cancer, cardiac disease and blood disorders.  In each case, the solution lies in complex 3D engineered environments for cell culture.  These colleagues make it clear that existing 3D scaffolds fail to provide the required complex orientational and spatial anisotropy, and are limited in their ability to impart appropriate biochemical and mechanical cues.

I have a strong track record in this area.  A particular success has been the use of a freeze drying technology to make collagen based porous implants for the cartilage-bone interface in the knee, which has now been commercialised.  The novelty of this proposal lies in the broadening of the established scientific base of this technology to enable biomacromolecular structures with:
(A) controlled and complex pore orientation to mimic many normal multi-oriented tissue structures
(B) compositional and positional control to match varying local biochemical environments,
(C) the attachment of novel peptides designed to control cell behaviour, and
(D) mechanical control at both a local and macroscopic level to provide mechanical cues for cells.
These will be complemented by the development of
(E) robust characterisation methodologies for the structures created.
These advances will then be employed in each of the medical areas above.

This approach is highly interdisciplinary.  Existing working relationships with experts in each medical field will guarantee expertise and licensed facilities in the required biological disciplines. Funds for this proposal would therefore establish a rich hub of mutually beneficial research and opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing of expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,267</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3DIMAGE"><Rcn>101524</Rcn><Nid>10460</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains</Name><PI>Paul Anthony Midgley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material&#226;&#128;&#153;s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and &#226;&#128;&#152;dual beam&#226;&#128;&#153; SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.

We propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D &#226;&#128;&#152;mesoscale&#226;&#128;&#153; structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.

We will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam.

High resolution &#226;&#128;&#147;nanoscale or molecular-, noninvasive and label-free imaging of three-dimensional soft matter-liquid interfaces has not been achieved by any microscopy method.
Force microscopy (AFM) is considered the second most relevant advance in materials science since 1960. Despite its impressive range of applications, the technique has some key limitations. Force microscopy has not three dimensional  depth. What lies above or in the subsurface is not readily characterized.

3DNanoMech proposes to design, build and operate a high speed force-based method for the three-dimensional characterization soft matter-liquid interfaces (3D AFM).  The microscope will combine a detection method based on force perturbations, adaptive algorithms,  high speed piezo actuators and quantitative-oriented multifrequency approaches. The development of the microscope cannot be separated from its applications:  imaging the error-free DNA repair and to understand the relationship existing between the nanomechanical properties and the malignancy of cancer cells. Those problems encompass the different spatial &#226;&#128;&#147;molecular-nano-mesoscopic- and time &#226;&#128;&#147;milli to seconds- scales of the instrument.

In short, 3DNanoMech aims to image, map and measure with picoNewton, millisecond and angstrom resolution soft matter surfaces and interfaces in liquid. The long-term vision of 3DNanoMech is to replace models or computer animations  of bimolecular-liquid interfaces by real time, molecular resolution maps of properties and processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,928</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="3SPIN"><Rcn>94098</Rcn><Nid>11307</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Three Dimensional Spintronics</Name><PI>Russell Paul Cowburn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spintronics, in which both the spin and the charge of the electron are used, is one of the most exciting new disciplines to emerge from nanoscience.

The thesis of the project is: that by careful control of the constituent nanostructure properties, a 3-dimensional medium can be created in which a large number of topological solitons can exist. Although hardly studied at all to date, these solitons should be stable at room temperature, extremely compact and easy to manipulate and propagate.

They permit determination of the positions of atoms in a crystal lattice or in a molecule as well as the distribution of electrons inside atoms. State-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond and attosecond resolution provides access to dynamic changes in the atomic and electronic structure of matter. Our proposal aims at combining these two frontier techniques of XXI century science to make a long-standing dream of scientist come true: the direct observation of atoms and electrons in their natural state: in motion. Shifts in the atoms positions by tens to hundreds of picometers can make chemical bonds break apart or newly form, changing the structure and/or chemical composition of matter. Electronic motion on similar scales may result in the emission of light, or the initiation of processes that lead to a change in physical or chemical properties, or biological function. These motions happen within femtoseconds and attoseconds, respectively. To make them observable, we need a 4-dimensional (4D) imaging technique capable of recording freeze-frame snapshots of microscopic systems with picometer spatial resolution and femtosecond to attosecond exposure time. The motion can then be visualized by slow-motion replay of the freeze-frame shots. The goal of this project is to develop a 4D imaging technique that will ultimately offer picometer resolution is space and attosecond resolution in time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="4PI-SKY"><Rcn>99443</Rcn><Nid>12402</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>4 pi sky: Extreme Astrophysics with Revolutionary Radio Telescopes</Name><PI>Robert Philip Fender</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Extreme astrophysical events   such as relativistic flows, cataclysmic explosions and black hole accretion   are one of the key areas for astrophysics in the 21st century. The extremes of physics experienced in these environments are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth, and provide a unique glimpse at the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes. All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang. In seeking to push back the frontiers of extreme astrophysics, I will use a trio of revolutionary new radio telescopes, LOFAR, ASKAP and MeerKAT, pathfinders for the Square Kilometre Array, and all facilities in which I have a major role in the search for transients. I will build an infrastructure which transforms their combined operations for the discovery, classification and reporting of transient astrophysical events, over the whole sky, making them much more than the sum of their parts. This will include development of environments for the coordinated handling of extreme astrophysical events, in real time, via automated systems, as well as novel techniques for the detection of these events in a sea of noise. I will furthermore augment this program by buying in as a major partner to a rapid-response robotic optical telescope, and by cementing my relationship with an orbiting X-ray facility. This multiwavelength dimension will secure the astrophysical interpretation of our observational results and help to revolutionise high-energy astrophysics via a strong scientific exploitation program.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,999,847</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DATADRIVE-B"><Rcn>102083</Rcn><Nid>10429</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Advanced Data-Driven Black-box modelling</Name><PI>Johan Adelia K Suykens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Making accurate predictions is a crucial factor in many systems (such as in modelling energy consumption, power load forecasting, traffic networks, process industry, environmental modelling, biomedicine, brain-machine interfaces) for cost savings, efficiency, health, safety and organizational purposes.  In this proposal we aim at realizing a new generation of more advanced black-box modelling techniques for estimating predictive models from measured data. We will study different optimization modelling frameworks in order to obtain improved black-box modelling approaches. This will be done by specifying models through constrained optimization problems by studying different candidate core models (parametric models, support vector machines and kernel methods) together with additional sets of constraints and regularization mechanisms. Different candidate mathematical frameworks will be considered with models that possess primal and (Lagrange) dual model representations, functional analysis in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator splitting and optimization in Banach spaces. Several aspects that are relevant to black-box models will be studied including incorporation of prior knowledge, structured dynamical systems, tensorial data representations, interpretability and sparsity, and general purpose optimization algorithms. The methods should be suitable for handling larger data sets and high dimensional input spaces. The final goal is also to realize a next generation software tool (including symbolic generation of models and handling different supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, static and dynamic systems) that can be generically applied to data from different application areas.

The main difficulties are the limited climate information, the computer cost of model simulations, and mathematical assumptions that are hardly verified and often overlooked in the literature.
A2C2 proposes a practical framework to overcome those three difficulties, linking the theory of dynamical systems and statistics. We will generalize the methodology of flow analogues to multiple databases in order to obtain probabilistic descriptions of analogue decompositions.
The project is divided into three workpackages (WP). WP1 embeds the analogue method in the theory of dynamical systems in order to provide a metric of an attractor deformation in time. The important methodological step is to detect trends or persisting outliers in the dates and scores of analogues when the system yields time-varying forcings. This is done from idealized models and full size climate models in which the forcings (anthropogenic and natural) are known.
A2C2 creates an open source toolkit to compute flow analogues from a wide array of databases (WP2). WP3 treats the two scientific challenges with the analogue method and multiple model ensembles, hence allowing uncertainty estimates under realistic mathematical hypotheses. The flow analogue methodology allows a systematic and quasi real-time analysis of extreme events, which is currently out of the reach of conventional climate modeling approaches.
The major breakthrough of A2C2 is to bridge the gap between operational needs (the immediate analysis of climate events) and the understanding long-term climate changes. A2C2 opens new research horizons for the exploitation of ensembles of simulations and reliable estimates of uncertainty."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,491,457</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A2F2"><Rcn>106800</Rcn><Nid>9437</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Beyond Biopolymers: Protein-Sized Aromatic Amide Functional Foldamers</Name><PI>Ivan Huc</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Nature has evolved ultimate chemical functions based on controlling and altering conformation of its molecular machinery.

In the last decade, chemists have discovered foldamers: non-natural oligomers and polymers also prone to adopt folded structures. The emergence of foldamers has far reaching implications. A new major long term prospect is open to chemistry: the de novo synthesis of artificial objects resembling biopolymers in terms of their size, complexity, and efficiency at achieving defined functions, yet having chemical structures beyond the reach of biopolymers amenable to new properties and functions. The PI of this project has shown internationally recognized leadership in the development of a class of foldamers, aromatic oligoamides, whose features arguably make them the most suitable candidates to systematically explore what folded structures beyond biopolymers give access to. This project aims at developing methods to allow the routine fabrication of 20-40 units long aromatic oligoamide foldamers (6-15 kDa) designed to fold into artificial molecular containers having engineerable cavities and surfaces for molecular recognition of organic substrates, in particular large peptides and saccharides, polymers, and proteins.

Immediate goals include the proof of irreducibility of automorphic Galois representations; the establishment of period relations for automorphic and potentially automorphic realizations of motives in the cohomology of distinct Shimura varieties; the construction of p-adic L-functions for these and related motives, notably adjoint and tensor product L-functions in p-adic families; and the geometrization of the p-adic and mod p Langlands program.

How can energy be extracted from black holes? What is the origin of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in jets and shocks? Is their primary energy stream hadronic or magnetic? I propose to do this by exploiting the advent of wide-field radio astronomy: extreme objects are very rare and usually transient, so not only must one survey large areas of sky, but also must one do this often. I propose to form and shape a group that will use the LOFAR wide-field radio telescope to hunt for these extreme transients and systematically collect enough well-documented examples of the behaviour of each type of transient. Furthermore, I propose to expand LOFAR with a true 24/7 all-sky monitor to catch and study even the rarest of events. Next, I will use my experience in gamma-ray burst followup to conduct a vigorous multi-wavelength programme of study of these objects, to constrain their physics from as many angles as possible. This will eventually include results from multi-messenger astrophysics, in which we use neutrinos, gravity waves, and other non-electromagnetic messengers as extra diagnostics of the physics of these sources.

Relativistic shocks are closely connected with the propagation of intense streams of particles pervasive in many astrophysical scenarios. The possibility of exciting shocks in the laboratory will also be available very soon with multi-PW lasers or intense relativistic particle beams.
Computational modeling is now established as a prominent research tool, by enabling the fully kinetic modeling of these systems for the first time.

In the atmosphere, one component of the earth system, there are crucial feedbacks between physical, chemical and biological processes. Thus many of the drivers of climate change depend on chemical processes in the atmosphere including, in addition to ozone and water vapour, methane, nitrous oxide, the halocarbons as well as a range of inorganic and organic aerosols. The link between chemistry and climate is two-way and changes in climate can influence atmospheric chemistry processes in a variety of ways.
Previous studies have looked at these interactions in isolation but the time is now right for more comprehensive studies. The crucial contribution that will be made here is in improving our understanding of the processes within this complex system. Process understanding has been the hallmark of my previous work.  The earth system scope here will be ambitiously wide but with a similar drive to understand fundamental processes.
The ambitious programme of research is built around four interrelated questions using new state-of-the-art modelling tools: How will the composition of the stratosphere change in the future, given changes in the concentrations of ozone depleting substances and greenhouse gases? How will these changes in the stratosphere affect tropospheric composition and climate? How will the composition of the troposphere change in the future, given changes in the emissions of ozone precursors and greenhouse gases? How will these changes in the troposphere affect the troposphere-stratosphere climate system?

To date, these rapid changes in climate and ocean circulation are still not fully explained. Two main obstacles prevent going beyond the current state of knowledge:
- Paleoclimatic proxy data are by essence only indirect indicators of the climatic variables, and thus can not be directly compared with model outputs;
- A 4-D (latitude, longitude, water depth, time) reconstruction of Atlantic water masses over the past 40 ky is lacking: previous studies have generated isolated records with disparate timescales which do not allow the causes of circulation changes to be identified.
Overcoming these two major limitations will lead to major breakthroughs in climate research. Concretely, I will create the first database of Atlantic deep-sea records over the last 40 ky, and extract full climatic information from these records through an innovative model-data integration scheme using an isotopic proxy forward modeling approach. The novelty and exceptional potential of this scheme is twofold: (i) it avoids hypotheses on proxy interpretation and hence suppresses or strongly reduces the errors of interpretation of paleoclimatic records; (ii) it produces states of the climate system that best explain the observations over the last 40 ky, while being consistent with the model physics.

These planets grew by the process of accretion, which involved numerous collisions with smaller (Moon- to Mars-size) bodies. Impacts with such bodies released sufficient energy to cause large-scale melting and the formation of deep &#226;&#128;&#156;magma oceans&#226;&#128;&#157;. Such magma oceans enabled liquid metal to separate from liquid silicate, sink and accumulate to form the metallic cores of the planets. Thus core formation in terrestrial planets was a multistage process, intimately related to the major impacts during accretion, that determined the chemistry of planetary mantles. However, until now, accretion, as modelled by astrophysicists, and core formation, as modelled by geochemists, have been treated as completely independent processes. The fundamental and crucial aim of this ambitious interdisciplinary proposal is to integrate astrophysical models of planetary accretion with geochemical models of planetary differentiation together with cosmochemical constraints obtained from meteorites. The research will involve integrating new models of planetary accretion with core formation models based on the partitioning of a large number of elements between liquid metal and liquid silicate that we will determine experimentally at pressures up to about 100 gigapascals (equivalent to 2400 km deep in the Earth). By comparing our results with the known physical and chemical characteristics of the terrestrial planets, we will obtain a comprehensive understanding of how these planets formed, grew and evolved, both physically and chemically, with time. The integration of chemistry and planetary differentiation with accretion models is a new ground-breaking concept that will lead, through synergies and feedback, to major new advances in the Earth and planetary sciences.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,826,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACRCC"><Rcn>110515</Rcn><Nid>8833</Nid><HI>The University Of Reading, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Understanding the atmospheric circulation response to climate change</Name><PI>Theodore Shepherd</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Computer models based on known physical laws are our primary tool for predicting climate change. Yet the state-of-the-art models exhibit a disturbingly wide range of predictions of future climate change, especially when examined at the regional scale, which has not decreased as the models have become more comprehensive. The reasons for this are not understood. This represents a basic challenge to our fundamental understanding of climate.

The divergence of model projections is presumably related to systematic model errors in the large-scale fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum that control regional aspects of climate. That these errors stubbornly persist in spite of increases in the spatial resolution of the models suggests that they are associated with errors in the representation of unresolved processes, whose effects must be parameterised.

Most attention in climate science has hitherto focused on the thermodynamic aspects of climate. Dynamical aspects, which involve the atmospheric circulation, have received much less attention. However regional climate, including persistent climate regimes and extremes, is strongly controlled by atmospheric circulation patterns, which exhibit chaotic variability and whose representation in climate models depends sensitively on parameterised processes. Moreover the dynamical aspects of model projections are much less robust than the thermodynamic ones. There are good reasons to believe that model bias, the divergence of model projections, and chaotic variability are somehow related, although the relationships are not well understood. This calls for studying them together.

My proposed research will focus on this problem, addressing these three aspects of the atmospheric circulation response to climate change in parallel: (i) diagnosing the sources of model error; (ii) elucidating the relationship between model error and the spread in model projections; (iii) understanding the physical mechanisms of atmospheric variability."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,489,151</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ACROSS"><Rcn>110816</Rcn><Nid>10170</Nid><HI>Rheinisch-Westfaelische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany</HI><Name>3D Reconstruction and Modeling across Different Levels of Abstraction</Name><PI>Leif Kobbelt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Digital 3D models are gaining more and more importance in diverse application fields ranging from computer graphics, multimedia and simulation sciences to engineering, architecture, and medicine. Powerful technologies to digitize the 3D shape of real objects and scenes are becoming available even to consumers.  However, the raw geometric data emerging from, e.g., 3D scanning or multi-view stereo often lacks a consistent structure and meta-information which are necessary for the effective deployment of such models in sophisticated down-stream applications like animation, simulation, or CAD/CAM that go beyond mere visualization. Our goal is to develop new fundamental algorithms which transform raw geometric input data into augmented 3D models that are equipped with structural meta information such as feature aligned meshes, patch segmentations, local and global geometric constraints, statistical shape variation data, or even procedural descriptions. Our methodological approach is inspired by the human perceptual system that integrates bottom-up (data-driven) and top-down (model-driven) mechanisms in its hierarchical processing. Similarly we combine algorithms operating on different levels of abstraction into reconstruction and modeling networks. Instead of developing an individual solution for each specific application scenario, we create an eco-system of algorithms for automatic processing and interactive design of highly complex 3D models. A key concept is the information flow across all levels of abstraction in a bottom-up as well as top-down fashion. We not only aim at optimizing geometric representations but in fact at bridging the gap between reconstruction and recognition of geometric objects. The results from this project will make it possible to bring 3D models of real world objects into many highly relevant applications in science, industry, and entertainment, greatly reducing the excessive manual effort that is still necessary today."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,482,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADDECCO"><Rcn>88841</Rcn><Nid>12644</Nid><HI>Institut National De Recherche Eninformatique Et Automatique, France</HI><Name>Adaptive Schemes for Deterministic and Stochastic Flow Problems</Name><PI>Remi Abgrall</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The numerical simulation of complex compressible flow problem is still a challenge nowaday even for simple models. In our opinion, the most important hard points that need currently to be tackled and solved is  how to obtain stable, scalable, very  accurate, easy to code and to maintain schemes on complex geometries. The method should easily handle  mesh refinement, even near the boundary where the most interesting engineering quantities have to be evaluated. Unsteady  uncertainties  in the model, for example in  the geometry or  the boundary conditions should represented  efficiently.This proposal goal is to  design, develop and evaluate solutions to each of the above problems. Our work program  will lead to significant breakthroughs for flow simulations. More specifically, we propose to work on 3 connected problems: 1-A class of very high order numerical schemes   able to easily deal with the geometry of boundaries and still can solve steep problems. The geometry is generally defined by CAD tools. The output  is used to generate a mesh which  is then used by the scheme. Hence, any mesh refinement process is disconnected from the CAD, a situation  that prevents the spread of mesh adaptation techniques in industry! 2-A class of very high order numerical schemes  which  can utilize possibly solution dependant basis functions in order to lower the number of degrees of freedom, for example to compute accurately  boundary layers with low resolutions.  3-A general non intrusive technique for handling uncertainties in order to deal with irregular probability density functions (pdf)  and also  to handle pdf that may evolve in time, for example thanks to an optimisation loop. The curse of dimensionality will be dealt thanks  Harten's multiresolution method combined with sparse grid methods. Currently, and up to our knowledge,  no scheme  has each of these properties. This research program will have an impact on numerical schemes and industrial applications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,432,769</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ADEQUATE"><Rcn>94565</Rcn><Nid>9809</Nid><HI>Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, France</HI><Name>Advanced optoelectronic Devices with Enhanced QUAntum efficiency at THz frEquencies</Name><PI>Carlo Sirtori</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of this project is the realisation of efficient mid-infrared and THz optoelectronic emitters. This work is motivated by the fact that the spontaneous emission in this frequency range is characterized by an extremely long lifetime when compared to non-radiative processes, giving rise to devices with very low quantum efficiency. To this end we want to develop hybrid light-matter systems, already well known in quantum optics, within optoelectronics devices, that will be driven by electrical injection. With this project we want to extend the field of optoelectronics by introducing some of the concepts of quantum optic, particularly the light-matter strong coupling, into semiconductor devices. More precisely this project aims at the implementation of novel optoelectronic emitters operating in the strong coupling regime between an intersubband excitation of a two-dimensional electron gas and a microcavity photonic mode. The quasiparticles issued from this coupling are called intersubband polaritons. The major difficulties and challenges of this project, do not lay in the observation of these quantum effects, but in their exploitation for a specific function, in particular an efficient electrical to optical conversion. To obtain efficient quantum emitters in the THz frequency range we will follow two different approaches: - In the first case we will try to exploit the additional characteristic time of the system introduced by the light-matter interaction in the strong (or ultra-strong) coupling regime. - The second approach will exploit the fact that, under certain conditions, intersubband polaritons have a bosonic character; as a consequence they can undergo stimulated scattering, giving rise to polaritons lasers as it has been shown for excitonic polaritons."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,761,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AEROCAT"><Rcn>111595</Rcn><Nid>10057</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Dresden, Germany</HI><Name>Non-ordered nanoparticle superstructures &#226;&#128;&#147; aerogels as efficient (electro-)catalysts</Name><PI>Alexander Eychm&#195;&#188;ller</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"AEROCAT aims at the elucidation of the potential of nanoparticle derived aerogels in catalytic applications.

The resulting aerogel materials will be characterized with respect to their morphology and composition and their resulting (electro-)catalytic properties examined in the light of the inherent electronic nature of the nanosized constituents. Using the knowledge gained within the project the aerogel materials will be further re-processed in order to exploit their full potential relevant to catalysis and electrocatalysis.

In the last few years, there have been several new developments where methods from representation theory, invariant theory, algebraic geometry, measure theory, functional analysis, and topology found new applications in discrete mathematics and optimization, both theoretically and algorithmically. Among the typical application areas are networks, coding, routing, timetabling, statistical and quantum physics, and computer science.
The project focuses in particular on:

A. Understanding partition functions with invariant theory and algebraic geometry
B. Graph limits, regularity, Hilbert spaces, and low rank approximation of polynomials
C. Reducing complexity in optimization by exploiting symmetry with representation theory

They form the link between ocean biogeochemistry through the physico-chemical processes near the water-air interface with primary and secondary aerosol formation and evolution in the air aloft and finally to the climate impact of marine boundary layer aerosols. However, their photochemistry and photosensitizer properties have only been suggested and discussed but never fully addressed because they were beyond reach. This project suggests going significantly beyond this matter of fact by a combination of innovative tools and the development of new ideas.
This project is therefore devoted to new laboratory investigations of processes occurring at the air sea interface to predict emission, formation and evolution of halogenated radicals and aerosols from this vast interface between oceans and atmosphere. It progresses from fundamental laboratory measurements, marine science, surface chemistry, photochemistry &#226;&#128;&#166; and is therefore interdisciplinary in nature.
It will lead to the development of innovative techniques for characterising chemical processing at the air sea interface (e.g., a multiphase atmospheric simulation chamber, a time-resolved fluorescence technique for characterising chemical processing at the air-sea interface). It will allow the assessment of new emerging ideas such as a quantitative description of the importance of photosensitized reactions in the visible at the air/sea interface as a major source of halogenated radicals and aerosols in the marine environment.
This new understanding will impact on our ability to describe atmospheric chemistry in the marine environment which has strong impact on the urban air quality of coastal regions (which by the way represent highly populated regions ) but also on climate change by providing new input for global climate models."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,366,276</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ALEM"><Rcn>185404</Rcn><Nid>12365</Nid><HI>Aalto-Korkeakoulusaatio, Finland</HI><Name>ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN ELECTRICAL MACHINES</Name><PI>Matti Antero Arkkio</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Electrical motors consume about 40 % of the electrical energy produced in the European Union. About 90 % of this energy is converted to mechanical work. However, 0.5-2.5 % of it goes to so called additional load losses whose exact origins are unknown. Our ambitious aim is to reveal the origins of these losses, build up numerical tools for modeling them and optimize electrical motors to minimize the losses.

As the hypothesis of the research, we assume that the additional losses mainly result from the deterioration of the core materials during the manufacturing process of the machine. By calorimetric measurements, we have found that the core losses of electrical machines may be twice as large as comprehensive loss models predict. The electrical steel sheets are punched, welded together and shrink fit to the frame. This causes residual strains in the core sheets deteriorating their magnetic characteristics. The cutting burrs make galvanic contacts between the sheets and form paths for inter-lamination currents. Another potential source of additional losses are the circulating currents between the parallel strands of random-wound armature windings. The stochastic nature of these potential sources of additional losses puts more challenge on the research.

We shall develop a physical loss model that couples the mechanical strains and electromagnetic losses in electrical steel sheets and apply the new model for comprehensive loss analysis of electrical machines. The stochastic variables related to the core losses and circulating-current losses will be discretized together with the temporal and spatial discretization of the electromechanical field variables. The numerical stochastic loss model will be used to search for such machine constructions that are insensitive to the manufacturing defects.

This includes taking into account the unique temporal dimension of Web archives, structured semantic information already available on the Web, as well as social media and network information.

Within ALEXANDRIA, we will significantly advance semantic and time-based indexing for Web archives using human-compiled knowledge available on the Web, to efficiently index, retrieve and explore information about entities and events from the past.

Specifically, we will attempt to resolve some outstanding open problems in algorithmic mechanism design: characterizing the incentive compatible mechanisms for important domains, such as the domain of combinatorial auctions, and resolving the approximation ratio of mechanisms for scheduling unrelated machines. More generally, we will study centralized and distributed algorithms whose inputs are controlled by selfish agents that are interested in the outcome of the computation. We will investigate new notions of mechanisms with strong truthfulness and limited susceptibility to externalities that can facilitate modular design of mechanisms of complex domains.

We will expand the current research on the price of anarchy to time-dependent games where the players can select not only how to act but also when to act. We also plan to resolve outstanding questions on the price of stability and to build a robust approach to these questions, similar to smooth analysis.

On the other hand, computer based theoretical design of advanced materials is an area where rapid and extensive developments are taking place. Within my group new theoretical tools have now been established which are extremely well suited to the study of complex materials. In this approach basic quantum mechanical theories are used to describe fundamental properties of alloys and compounds. The utilization of such calculations to investigate possible optimizations of certain key properties represents a major departure from the traditional design philosophy. The purpose of my project is to build up a new competence in the field of computer-aided simulations of advanced materials. The main goal will be to achieve a deep understanding of the behaviour of complex metallic systems under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions at the atomic level by studying their electronic, magnetic and atomic structure using the most modern and advanced computational methods. This will enable us to establish a set of materials parameters and composition-structure-property relations that are needed for materials optimization. 

The research will be focused on fundamental technological properties related to defects in advanced metallic alloys (high-performance steels, superalloys, and refractory, energy related and geochemical materials) and alloy phases (solid solutions, intermetallic compounds), which will be studied by means of parameter free atomistic simulations combined with continuum modelling. As a first example, we will study the Fe-Cr system, which is of great interest to industry as well as in connection to nuclear waste.

One project is aimed at extending the research into a processive catalytic system that is more suitable for industrial application. Two projects involve more farsighted studies and are designed to push the research way beyond the current boundaries into the area of Turing machines and bio-rotaxane catalysts which can modify DNA in a non-natural process. The vision of this proposal is to open up the field of &#226;&#128;&#152;processive catalysis&#226;&#128;&#153; and invigorate the next generation of chemists to develop information transfer and toroidal processive catalysts. The construction of synthetic analogues of processive enzymes could open a gate toward a large range of applications, ranging from intelligent tailoring of polymers to information storage and processing."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,603,699</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AMIMOS"><Rcn>88967</Rcn><Nid>11709</Nid><HI>Kungliga Tekniska Hoegskolan, Sweden</HI><Name>"Agile MIMO Systems for Communications, Biomedicine, and Defense"</Name><PI>Bjorn Ottersten</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal targets the emerging frontier research field of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems along with several innovative and somewhat unconventional applications of such systems. The use of arrays of transmitters and receivers will have a profound impact on future medical imaging/therapy systems, radar systems, and radio communication networks. Multiple transmitters provide a tremendous versatility and allow waveforms to be adapted temporally and spatially to environmental conditions. This is useful for individually tailored illumination of human tissue in biomedical imaging or ultrasound therapy. In radar systems, multiple transmit beams can be formed simultaneously via separate waveform designs allowing accurate target classification. In a wireless communication system, multiple communication signals can be directed to one or more users at the same time on the same frequency carrier. In addition, multiple receivers can be used in the above applications to provide increased detection performance, interference rejection, and improved estimation accuracy. The joint modelling, analysis, and design of these multidimensional transmit and receive schemes form the core of this research proposal. Ultimately, our research aims at developing the fundamental tools that will allow the design of wireless communication systems with an order-of-magnitude higher capacity at a lower cost than today; of ultrasound therapy systems maximizing delivered power while reducing treatment duration and unwanted illumination; and of distributed aperture multi-beam radars allowing more effective target location, identification, and classification. Europe has several successful industries that are active in biomedical imaging/therapy, radar systems, and wireless communications. The future success of these sectors critically depends on the ability to innovate and integrate new technology."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,872,720</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ANAMULTISCALE"><Rcn>98542</Rcn><Nid>11582</Nid><HI>Forschungsverbund Berlin Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Analysis of Multiscale Systems Driven by Functionals</Name><PI>Alexander Mielke</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Many complex phenomena in the sciences are described by nonlinear partial differential equations, the solutions of which exhibit oscillations and concentration effects on multiple temporal or spatial scales. Our aim is to use methods from applied analysis to contribute to the understanding of the interplay of effects on different scales. The central question is to determine those quantities on the microscale which are needed to for the correct description of the macroscopic evolution.
We aim to develop a mathematical framework for analyzing and modeling coupled systems with multiple scales.  This will include Hamiltonian dynamics as well as different types of dissipation like gradient flows or rate-independent dynamics.  The choice of models will be guided by specific applications in material modeling (e.g., thermoplasticity, pattern formation, porous media) and optoelectronics (pulse interaction, Maxwell-Bloch systems, semiconductors, quantum mechanics).  The research will address mathematically fundamental issues like existence and stability of solutions but will mainly be devoted to the modeling of multiscale phenomena in evolution systems. We will focus on systems with geometric structures, where the dynamics is driven by functionals. Thus, we can go much beyond the classical theory of homogenization and singular perturbations. The novel features of our approach are
- the combination of different dynamical effects in one framework,
- the use of geometric and metric structures for coupled partial differential equations,
- the exploitation of Gamma-convergence for evolution systems driven by functionals.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,390,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ANGEOM"><Rcn>107882</Rcn><Nid>9584</Nid><HI>Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Spain</HI><Name>Geometric analysis in the Euclidean space</Name><PI>Xavier Tolsa Domenech</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"We propose to study different questions in the area of the so called geometric analysis. Most of the topics we are interested in deal with the connection between the behavior of singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures. The study of this connection has been shown to be extremely helpful in the solution of certain long standing problems in the last years, such as the solution of the Painlev\'e problem or the obtaining of the optimal distortion bounds for quasiconformal mappings by Astala.
More specifically, we would like to study the relationship between the L^2 boundedness of singular integrals associated with Riesz and other related kernels, and rectifiability and other geometric notions. The so called David-Semmes problem is probably the main open problem in this area. Up to now, the techniques used to deal with this problem come from multiscale analysis and involve ideas from Littlewood-Paley theory and quantitative techniques of rectifiability. We propose to apply new ideas that combine variational arguments with other techniques which have connections with mass transportation. Further, we think that it is worth to explore in more detail the connection among mass transportation, singular integrals, and uniform rectifiability.
We are also interested in the field of quasiconformal mappings. We plan to study a problem regarding the quasiconformal distortion of quasicircles. This problem consists in proving that the bounds obtained recently by S. Smirnov on the dimension of K-quasicircles are optimal. We want to apply techniques from quantitative geometric measure theory to deal with this question.
Another question  that we intend to explore lies in the interplay of harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory and partial differential equations. This concerns an old problem on the unique continuation of harmonic functions at the boundary open C^1  or Lipschitz domain. All the results known by now deal with smoother Dini domains."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,105,930</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ANTEGEFI"><Rcn>89124</Rcn><Nid>9633</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Napoli Federico Ii., Italy</HI><Name>Analytic Techniques for Geometric and Functional Inequalities</Name><PI>Nicola Fusco</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Isoperimetric and Sobolev inequalities are the best known examples of geometric-functional inequalities.

Yet, building high-assurance distributed programs is notoriously challenging. One of the main reasons is that these systems usually seek to achieve several goals at the same time. In short, they need to be efficient, responding effectively in various average-case conditions, as well as reliable, behaving correctly in severe, worst-case conditions. As a consequence, they typically intermingle different strategies: each to cope with some specific condition, e.g., with or without node failures, message losses, time-outs, contention, cache misses,
over-sizing, malicious attacks, etc. The resulting programs end up hard to design, prove, verify, implement, test and debug. Not surprisingly, there are anecdotal evidences of the fragility of the most celebrated distributed systems.

The goal of this project is to contribute to building high-assurance distributed programs by introducing a new dimension for separating and isolating their concerns, as well as a new scheme for composing and reusing them in a modular manner. In short, the project will explore the inherent power and limitations of a novel paradigm, Adversary-Oriented Computing (AOC). Sub-programs, each implementing a specific strategy to cope with a given adversary, modelling a specific working condition, are designed, proved, verified, implemented, tested and debugged independently. They are then composed, possibly dynamically, as black-boxes within the same global program. The AOC project is ambitious and it seeks to fundamentally revisit the way distributed algorithms are designed and distributed systems are implemented. The gain expected in comparison with today's approaches is substantial, and I believe it will be proportional to the degree of difficulty of the distributed problem at hand."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,147,012</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="APHOTOREACTOR"><Rcn>185433</Rcn><Nid>12356</Nid><HI>Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet Erlangen Nuernberg, Germany</HI><Name>Entirely Self-organized: Arrayed Single-Particle-in-a-Cavity Reactors for Highly Efficient and Selective Catalytic/Photocatalytic Energy Conversion and Solar Light Reaction Engineering</Name><PI>Patrik Schmuki</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The proposal is built on the core idea to use an ensemble of multiple level self-organization processes to create a next generation photocatalytic platform that provides unprecedented property and reactivity control.

This library of two-dimensional crystals opens a possibility to construct various 3D structures with on-demand properties, which do not exist in nature but can be assembled in Lego style by stacking individual atomic planes on top of each other in a desired sequence.

These industries have become highly dependent on coupling technologies employing homogeneous late transition metal catalysis and this reliance will grow further,  particularly if the substrate scope can be broadened, the economics, in terms of reagents and catalyst, made more favourable, the reliability at scale-up improved, and the generation of side-products, of particular importance for optical and electronic properties of materials, minimized or eliminated.

This proposal addresses these issues by conducting a detailed and comprehensive mechanistic investigation of direct arylation, so that a substantial expansion of the reaction scope can be achieved. At present, the regioselectivity can be very high, however catalyst turnover rates are moderate, and the arene is required to be in a fairly narrow window of activity. Specific aspects to be addressed in terms of mechanistic study are: catalyst speciation and pathways for deactivation; pathways for homocoupling; influence of anions and dummy ligands; protodemetalloidation pathways. Areas proposed for mechanism-informed development are: expansion of metalloid tolerance; expansion of arene scope; use of traceless activators and directors, new couplings via ligand exchange, the evolution of simpler / cheaper and more selective / active catalysts; expansion to oxidative double arylations (Ar-H + Ar&#226;&#128;&#153;-H) with control, and without resort to super-stoichiometric bias.

More generally, Ubicomp infrastructures &#226;&#128;&#147; controlled by software &#226;&#128;&#147; will determine users&#226;&#128;&#153; access to critical services.

With these opportunities come higher risks of misuse by malicious agents. Therefore, the role and design of software for managing use and protecting against misuse is critical, and the engineering of software that is both functionally effective while safe guarding user assets from harm is a key challenge. Indeed the very nature of Ubicomp means that software must adapt to the changing needs of users and their environment, and, more critically, to the different threats to users&#226;&#128;&#153; security and privacy.

Although chemistry and in particular catalysis evolved on a largely empirical basis in the past, we strongly believe the complexity of the challenges at hand to make this a less ideal approach. In consequence, developing selective and asymmetric cluster catalysis will be based on a detailed molecular understanding and will not only require intense methodological developments for the synthesis and characterization of asymmetric catalysts and the detection of chiral and isomeric product molecules but also make use of innovative basic science in the fields of surface chemistry, cluster science, spectroscopy and kinetics.

(b) preparation and characterization of isomer- and enantioselective heterogeneous catalysts based on chiral metal clusters or molecule-cluster-complexes.

Solutions to these problems have now come within reach due to three advances we recently reported: first, the steep scaling of the computational cost with molecular size can be reduced to linear by exploiting the short-range character of electron correlation (local correlation methods). Second, the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of these local correlation methods can be strongly improved by new  tensor decomposition approaches and the inclusion of terms depending explicitly on the inter-electronic distances (F12 methods). Third, the development of highly complex electronic structure theories can be greatly facilitated and accelerated by new automated tensor network evaluation techniques. We are certain that by combining and generalizing these advances the long-standing problems (i) and (ii) can be solved. We will focus especially on highly scalable algorithms in order to use massively parallel computer systems efficiently. For linear-scaling methods this means that the size of the molecules that can be treated in a fixed time will grow linearly with the number of available processors. We will furthermore explore new multi-reference ans&#195;&#164;tze and implement analytical energy gradients and response properties for local methods.

These observational efforts will be supplemented by sophisticated modelling of stellar evolution, and by the development of asteroseismic tools to use the observations to probe stellar interiors. This will lead to a far more reliable determination of stellar ages, and hence ages of other astrophysical objects; it will compare the properties of the Sun with other stars and hence provide an understanding of the life history of the Sun; it will investigate the physical processes that control stellar properties, both at the level of the thermodynamical properties of stellar plasmas and the hydrodynamical instabilities that play a central role in stellar evolution; and it will characterize central stars in extra-solar planetary systems, determining the size and age of the star and hence constrain the evolution of the planetary systems.

On the other hand, experiments on rather complex material systems often suffer from material imperfections or from a lack of tunability of materials&#226;&#128;&#153; properties within a wide range. Our experimental studies within this project therefore will focus on model-type systems which can be prepared and thoroughly characterized with atomic level precision. The growth of the model-type samples will be controlled vertically one atomic layer at a time and laterally by making use of single-atom manipulation techniques. Atomic-scale characterization at low energy-scales will be performed by low-temperature spin-resolved elastic and inelastic scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) as well as by non-contact atomic force microscopy and spectroscopy based techniques. Transport experiments will be conducted by a four-probe STM setup under well-defined ultra-high vacuum conditions. By having access to the electronic and spin, as well as to the vibrational degrees of freedom down to the atomic level, we hope to be able to identify the nature of and the conditions for inducing superconductivity at high temperatures, which could ultimately lead a knowledge-based design of high-Tc superconductors."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,170,696</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ATHENE"><Rcn>98357</Rcn><Nid>13055</Nid><HI>Bundesanstalt Fuer Gewaesserkunde, Germany</HI><Name>Designing new technical wastewater treatment solutions targeted for organic micropollutant biodegradation, by understanding enzymatic pathways and assessing detoxification</Name><PI>Thomas Ternes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The identification of degradation pathways relevant for organic micropollutants in biological wastewater treatment processes is currently a major gap, preventing a profound evaluation of the capability of biological wastewater treatment. By elucidating the responsible enzymatic reactions of mixed microbial populations this project will cover this gap and thereby allow finding technical solutions that harness the true potential of biological processes for an enhanced biodegradation and detoxification. Due to the multi-disciplinary approach Athene will have impacts on the fields of biological wastewater treatment, analytical and environmental chemistry, environmental microbiology, water and (eco)toxicity. The multi-disciplinary approach of the project requires the involvement of a co-investigator experienced in process engineering and microbiology in wastewater treatment. Athene will go far beyond state-of-the-art in the following fields: a) efficiency in chemical analysis and structure identification of transformation products at environmental relevant concentrations; b) identification of enzymatic pathways relevant for micropollutant degradation in biological wastewater treatment; c) designing innovative technical solutions to maximize biodegradation; d) map and model relevant enzymatic pathways for environmental concentrations. Furthermore, designing biological wastewater treatment processes by understanding enzymatic pathways relevant for organic micropollutants removal represents a paradigm shift for municipal wastewater treatment. In the context of the actual scientific discussion about the relevance of trace organics in the aquatic environment and in drinking water, this topic is deemed as highly innovative: for its potential of proposing new technical options as well as for the gain in understanding compound persistency. Finally enzymatic reactions as well as the treatment schemes will be assessed for there capability to reduce toxiciological effects.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,473,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ATMNUCLE"><Rcn>88963</Rcn><Nid>13113</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Atmospheric nucleation: from molecular to global scale</Name><PI>Markku Tapio Kulmala</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Atmospheric aerosol particles and trace gases affect the quality of our life in many ways (e.g. health effects, changes in climate and hydrological cycle). Trace gases and atmospheric aerosols are tightly connected via physical, chemical, meteorological and biological processes occurring in the atmosphere and at the atmosphere-biosphere interface. One important phenomenon is atmospheric aerosol formation, which involves the production of nanometer-size particles by nucleation and their growth to detectable sizes.  The main scientific objectives of this project are 1) to quantify the mechanisms responsible for atmospheric new particle formation and 2) to find out how important this process is for the behaviour of the global aerosol system and, ultimately, for the whole climate system.  Our scientific plan is designed as a research chain that aims to advance our understanding of climate and air quality through a series of connected activities. We start from molecular simulations and laboratory measurements to understand nucleation and aerosol thermodynamic processes. We measure nanoparticles and atmospheric clusters at 15-20 sites all around the world using state of the art instrumentation and study feedbacks and interactions between climate and biosphere. With these atmospheric boundary layer studies we form a link to regional-scale processes and further to global-scale phenomena. In order to be able to simulate global climate and air quality, the most recent progress on this chain of processes must be compiled, integrated and implemented in Climate Change and Air Quality numerical models via novel parameterizations.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ATMOPACS"><Rcn>97389</Rcn><Nid>11784</Nid><HI>Foundation For Research And Technology Hellas, Greece</HI><Name>"Atmospheric Organic Particulate Matter, Air Quality and Climate Change Studies"</Name><PI>Spyridon Pandis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Despite its importance for human health and climate change organic aerosol (OA) remains one of the least understood aspects of atmospheric chemistry.

The objectives of ATMOPACS are: (i) The development of a new unified framework for the description of OA based on its two most important parameters: volatility and oxygen content. (ii) The development of measurement techniques for the volatility distribution and oxygen content distribution of OA. This will allow the experimental characterization of OA in this new &#226;&#128;&#156;coordinate system&#226;&#128;&#157;.

The main disciplines concerned are: Ultrafast laser sciences, Magnetism and Spin-Photonics, Relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics. Three issues of modern magnetism are addressed. 1. How fast can one modify and control the magnetization of a magnetic system ? 2. What is the role and essence of the coherent interaction between light and spins ? 3. How far spin-photonics can bring us to the real world of data acquisition and storage ? - We want first to provide solid ground experiments, unravelling the mechanisms involved in the demagnetization induced by laser pulses in a variety of magnetic materials (ferromagnetic nanostructures, aggregates and molecular magnets). We will explore the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnets using an attosecond laser source. - Second we want to explore how the photon field interacts with the spins. We will investigate the dynamical regime when the potential of the atoms is dressed by the Coulomb potential induced by the laser field. A strong support from the relativistic Quantum Electro-Dynamics is necessary towards that goal. - Third, even though our general approach is fundamental, we want to provide a benchmark of what is realistically possible in ultrafast spin-photonics, breaking the conventional thought that spin photonics is hard to implement at the application level. We will realize ultimate devices combining magneto-optical microscopy with the conventional magnetic recording. This new field will raise the interest of a number of competitive laboratories at the international level.

The project targets contributions to humanoid robot autonomy (for rescue and service robotics), to advanced human body simulation (for applications in ergonomics), and to a new theory of embodied intelligence (by promoting a motion-based semiotics of the human action).

Actions take place in the physical space while they originate in the &#226;&#128;&#147;robot or human&#226;&#128;&#147; sensory-motor space. Geometry is the core abstraction that makes the link between these spaces. Considering that the structure of actions inherits from that of the body, the underlying intuition is that actions can be segmented within discrete sub-spaces lying in the entire continuous posture space. Such sub-spaces are viewed as symbols bridging deliberative reasoning and reactive control. Actanthrope argues that geometric approaches to motion segmentation and generation as promising and innovative routes to explore embodied intelligence:
- Motion segmentation: what are the sub-manifolds that define the structure of a given action?
- Motion generation: among all the solution paths within a given sub-manifold, what is the underlying law that makes the selection?
In Robotics these questions are related to the competition between abstract symbol manipulation and physical signal processing. In Computational Neuroscience the questions refer to the quest of motion invariants. The ambition of the project is to promote a dual perspective: exploring the computational foundations of human action to make better robots, while simultaneously doing better robotics to better understand human action.

A unique &#226;&#128;&#156;Anthropomorphic Action Factory&#226;&#128;&#157; supports the methodology. It aims at attracting to a single lab, researchers with complementary know-how and solid mathematical background. All of them will benefit from unique equipments, while being stimulated by four challenges dealing with locomotion and manipulation actions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AdS-CFT-solvable"><Rcn>108872</Rcn><Nid>10322</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Origins of integrability in AdS/CFT correspondence</Name><PI>Vladimir Kazakov</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Fundamental interactions in nature are well described by quantum gauge fields in 4 space-time dimensions (4d). When the strength of gauge interaction is weak the Feynman perturbation techniques are very efficient for the description of most of the experimentally observable consequences of the Standard model and for the study of high energy processes in QCD.
But in the intermediate and strong coupling regime, such as the relatively small energies in QCD, the perturbation theory fails leaving us with no reliable analytic methods (except the Monte-Carlo simulation). The project aims at working out new analytic and computational methods for strongly coupled gauge theories in 4d. We will employ for that two important discoveries: 1) the gauge-string duality (AdS/CFT correspondence) relating certain strongly coupled gauge Conformal Field
Theories to the weakly coupled string theories on Anty-deSitter space; 2) the solvability, or integrability of maximally supersymmetric (N=4) 4d super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in multicolor limit. Integrability made possible pioneering exact numerical and analytic results in the N=4 multicolor SYM at any coupling, effectively summing up all 4d Feynman diagrams. Recently, we conjectured a system of functional equations - the AdS/CFT Y-system &#226;&#128;&#147; for the exact spectrum of anomalous dimensions of all local operators in N=4 SYM. The conjecture has passed all available checks. My project is aimed at the understanding of origins of this, still mysterious integrability. Deriving the AdS/CFT Y-system from the first principles on both sides of gauge-string duality should provide a long-awaited proof of the AdS/CFT correspondence itself. I plan to use the Y-system to study the systematic weak and strong coupling expansions and the so called BFKL limit, as well as for calculation of multi-point correlation functions of N=4 SYM. We hope on new insights into the strong coupling dynamics of less supersymmetric gauge theories and of QCD.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,456,140</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AfterTheGoldrush"><Rcn>102021</Rcn><Nid>10432</Nid><HI>Cardiff University, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Addressing global sustainability challenges by changing perceptions in catalyst design</Name><PI>Graham John Hutchings</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the greatest challenges facing society is the sustainability of resources.  At present, a step change in the sustainable use of resources is needed and catalysis lies at the heart of the solution by providing new routes to carbon dioxide mitigation, energy security and water conservation. It is clear that new high efficiency game-changing catalysts are required to meet the challenge. This proposal will focus on excellence in catalyst design by learning from recent step change advances in gold catalysis by challenging perceptions. Intense interest in gold catalysts over the past two decades has accelerated our understanding of gold particle-size effects, gold-support and gold-metal interactions, the interchange between atomic and ionic gold species, and the role of the gold-support interface in creating and maintaining catalytic activity.  The field has also driven the development of cutting-edge techniques, particularly in microscopy and transient kinetics, providing detailed structural characterisation on the nano-scale and probing the short-range and often short-lived interactions.  By comparison, our understanding of other metal catalysts has remained relatively static.

The proposed programme will engender a step change in the design of supported-metal catalysts, by exploiting the learning and the techniques emerging from gold catalysis.  The research will be set out in two themes. In Theme 1 two established key grand challenges will be attacked; namely, energy vectors and greenhouse gas control.  Theme 2 will address two new and emerging grand challenges in catalysis namely the effective low temperature activation of primary carbon hydrogen bonds and CO2 utilisation where instead of treating CO2 as a thermodynamic endpoint, the aim will be to re-use it as a feedstock for bulk chemical and fuel production. The legacy of the research will be the development of a new catalyst design approach that will provide a tool box for future catalyst development.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,279,785</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ApproxNP"><Rcn>88381</Rcn><Nid>12303</Nid><HI>Kungliga Tekniska Hoegskolan, Sweden</HI><Name>Approximation of NP-hard optimization problems</Name><PI>Johan H&#195;&#165;stad</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The proposed project aims to create a center of excellence that aims at understanding the approximability of NP-hard optimization problems.

Many existing strong results are based on what is known as the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) and a significant part of the project will be devoted to studying this conjecture.  We expect that a major step needed to be taken in this process is to further develop the understanding of Boolean functions on the Boolean hypercube.

This work focuses on the solar dynamo, but dynamos in other astrophysical systems will also be addressed. In particular, direct high-resolution three-dimensional simulations are used to understand particular aspects of the solar dynamo and ultimately to simulate the solar dynamo as a whole. Phenomenological approaches will be avoided in favor of obtaining rigorous results. A major problem is catastrophic quenching, i.e. the decline of dynamo effects in inverse proportion to the magnetic Reynolds number, which is huge. Tremendous advances have been made in the last few years since the cause of catastrophic quenching in dynamos has been understood in terms of magnetic helicity evolution. The numerical tools are now in place to allow for magnetic helicity fluxes via coronal mass ejections, thus alleviating catastrophic quenching. This work employs simulations in spherical shells, augmented by Cartesian simulations in special cases. The roles of the near-surface shear layer, the tachocline, as well as pumping in the bulk of the convection zone are to be clarified. The Pencil Code will be used for most applications. The code is third order in time and sixth order in space and is used for solving the hydromagnetic equations. It is a public domain code developed by roughly 20 scientists world wide and maintained under an a central versioning system at Nordita. Automatic nightly tests of currently 30 applications ensure the integrity of the code. It is used for a wide range of applications and may include the effects of radiation, self-gravity, dust, chemistry, variable ionization, cosmic rays, in addition to those of magnetohydrodynamics.

Heavy-ion collisions explore the strong dynamics of quarks and gluons, which also governs the deep interior of neutron stars, while strongly correlated electrons determine the physics of high-temperature superconductors and spin liquids. Numerical simulations of such systems are often hindered by sign problems. In quantum link models - an alternative formulation of gauge theories developed by the applicant - gauge fields emerge from discrete quantum variables. In the past year, in close collaboration with atomic physicists, we have established quantum link models as a framework for the atomic quantum simulation of dynamical gauge fields. Abelian gauge theories can be realized with Bose-Fermi mixtures of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, while non-Abelian gauge fields arise from fermionic constituents embodied by alkaline-earth atoms. Quantum simulators, which do not suffer from the sign problem, shall be constructed to address non-trivial dynamics, including quantum phase transitions in spin liquids, the real-time dynamics of confining strings as well as of chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and baryon density, baryon superfluidity, or color-flavor locking. New classical simulation algorithms shall be developed in order to solve severe sign problems, to investigate confining gauge theories, and to validate the proposed quantum simulators. Starting from U(1) and SU(2) gauge theories, an atomic physics tool box shall be developed for quantum simulation of gauge theories of increasing complexity, ultimately aiming at 4-d Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This project is based on innovative ideas from particle, condensed matter, and computational physics, and requires an interdisciplinary team of researchers. It has the potential to drastically increase the power of simulations and to address very challenging problems that cannot be solved with classical simulation methods.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,975,242</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Attoclock"><Rcn>107403</Rcn><Nid>12950</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Clocking fundamental attosecond electron dynamics</Name><PI>Ursula Keller</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The attoclock is a powerful, new, and unconventional tool to study fundamental attosecond dynamics on an atomic scale. We established its potential by using the first attoclock to measure the tunneling delay time in laser-induced ionization of helium and argon atoms, with surprising results. Building on these first proof-of-principle measurements, I propose to amplify and expand this tool concept to explore the following key questions:  How fast can light liberate electrons from a single atom, a single molecule, or a solid-state system? Related are more questions: How fast can an electron tunnel through a potential barrier? How fast is a multi-photon absorption process? How fast is single-photon photoemission? Many of these questions will undoubtedly spark more questions &#226;&#128;&#147; revealing deeper and more detailed insights on the dynamics of some of the most fundamental and relevant optoelectronic processes.
There are still many unknown and unexplored areas here. Theory has failed to offer definitive answers. Simulations based on the exact time-dependent Schr&#195;&#182;dinger equation have not been possible in most cases. Therefore one uses approximations and simpler models to capture the essential physics. Such semi-classical models potentially will help to understand attosecond energy and charge transport in larger molecular systems.  Indeed the attoclock provides a unique tool to explore different semi-classical models.
For example, the question of whether electron tunneling through an energetically forbidden region takes a finite time or is instantaneous has been subject to ongoing debate for the last sixty years. The tunnelling process, charge transfer, and energy transport all play key roles in electronics, energy conversion, chemical and biological reactions, and fundamental processes important for improved information, health, and energy technologies. We believe the attoclock can help refine and resolve key models for many of these important underlying attosecond processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,319,796</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BAYES-KNOWLEDGE"><Rcn>192369</Rcn><Nid>13439</Nid><HI>Queen Mary And Westfield College, University Of London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Effective Bayesian Modelling with Knowledge before Data</Name><PI>Norman Fenton</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims to improve evidence-based decision-making. What makes it radical is that it plans to do this in situations (common for critical risk assessment problems) where there is little or even no data, and hence where traditional statistics cannot be used.  To address this problem Bayesian analysis, which enables domain experts to supplement observed data with subjective probabilities, is normally used. As real-world problems typically involve multiple uncertain variables, Bayesian analysis is extended using a technique called Bayesian networks (BNs). But, despite many great benefits, BNs have been under-exploited, especially in areas where they offer the greatest potential for improvements (law, medicine and systems engineering).  This is mainly because of widespread resistance to relying on subjective knowledge. To address this problem much current research assumes sufficient data are available to make the expert&#226;&#128;&#153;s input minimal or even redundant; with such data it may be possible to &#226;&#128;&#152;learn&#226;&#128;&#153; the underlying BN model. But this approach offers nothing when there is limited or no data. Even when &#226;&#128;&#152;big&#226;&#128;&#153; data are available the resulting models may be superficially objective but fundamentally flawed as they fail to capture the underlying causal structure that only expert knowledge can provide.

Our solution is to develop a method to systemize the way expert driven causal BN models can be built and used effectively either in the absence of data or as a means of determining what future data is really required. The method involves a new way of framing problems and extensions to BN theory, notation and tools. Working with relevant domain experts, along with cognitive psychologists, our methods will be developed and tested experimentally on real-world critical decision-problems in medicine, law, forensics, and transport. As the work complements current data-driven approaches, it will lead to improved BN modelling both when there is extensive data as well as none.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,572,562</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BCCI"><Rcn>89741</Rcn><Nid>13034</Nid><HI>Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Germany</HI><Name>Bidirectional cortical communication interface</Name><PI>Wolfgang Rosenstiel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims at establishing bidirectional communication via the cortical areas of the brain. In recent years there have been extensive research efforts for establishing an efferent pathway from the brain by means of cortical recordings to allow patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke or high spinal cord lesions to interact with their environment (Birbaumer and Cohen, 2007; Wolpaw et al., 2002). As an extension this project will investigate the possibility of an afferent pathway to the brain by means of cortical stimulation, since it is ex-pected that stimulation might help to increase the information transfer rate for the efferent path-way. To achieve this there are two possible stimulation paradigms to be investigated. The first is based on the identification of optimal brain states for communication and the active maintenance of these states by stimulation. Inspired by classical conditioning, the second stimulation paradigm seeks to support and accelerate the rehabilitation process in stroke patients, as well as the learning process needed for the efferent communication pathway in ALS patients. By development of visual cortical prostheses (Schmidt et al., 1996) it became apparent that there are several fundamental problems related to cortical stimulation, which need to be solved before it is possible to evoke well-defined neural responses by stimulation - a prerequisite of the stimulation paradigms mentioned above. To overcome these problems it is envisaged to adapt stimulus parameters based on the current background brain activity by a feedback system in real time. Leveraging prior knowledge from microstimulation studies the feasibility of this approach will be evaluated by simultaneous stimulation and recording from ECoG grids and accompanied by the development of suitable algorithms.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,169,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2012-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BEAMING"><Rcn>101523</Rcn><Nid>9204</Nid><HI>Tel Aviv University, Israel</HI><Name>Detecting massive-planet/brown-dwarf/low-mass-stellar companions with the beaming effect</Name><PI>Moshe Zvi Mazeh</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"I propose to lead an international observational effort to characterize the population of massive planets, brown dwarf and stellar secondaries orbiting their parent stars with short periods, up to 10-30 days. The effort will utilize the superb, accurate, continuous lightcurves of more than hundred thousand stars obtained recently by two space missions &#226;&#128;&#147; CoRoT and Kepler. I propose to use these lightcurves to detect non-transiting low-mass companions with a new algorithm, BEER, which I developed recently together with Simchon Faigler. BEER searches for the beaming effect, which causes the stellar intensity to increase if the star is moving towards the observer. The combination of the beaming effect with other modulations induced by a low-mass companion produces periodic modulation with a specific signature, which is used to detect small non-transiting companions. The accuracy of the space mission lightcurves is enough to detect massive planets with short periods. The proposed project is equivalent to a radial-velocity survey of tens of thousands of stars, instead of the presently active surveys which observe only hundreds of stars.
We will use an assortment of telescopes to perform radial velocity follow-up observations in order to confirm the existence of the detected companions, and to derive their masses and orbital eccentricities. We will discover many tens, if not hundreds, of new massive planets and brown dwarfs with short periods, and many thousands of new binaries. The findings will enable us to map the mass, period, and eccentricity distributions of planets and stellar companions, determine the upper mass of planets, understand the nature of the brown-dwarf desert, and put strong constrains on the theory of planet and binary formation and evolution."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,737,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BI-DSC"><Rcn>107008</Rcn><Nid>9682</Nid><HI>Universidade Do Porto, Portugal</HI><Name>Building Integrated Dye Sensitized Solar Cells</Name><PI>Ad&#195;&#169;lio Miguel Magalhaes Mendes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"In the last decade, solar and photovoltaic (PV) technologies have emerged as a potentially major technology for power generation in the world. So far the PV field has been dominated by silicon devices, even though this technology is still expensive.Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) are an important type of thin-film photovoltaics due to their potential for low-cost fabrication and versatile applications, and because their aesthetic appearance, semi-transparency and different color possibilities.This advantageous characteristic makes DSC the first choice for building integrated photovoltaics.Despite their great potential, DSCs for building applications are still not available at commercial level. However, to bring DSCs to a marketable product several developments are still needed and the present project targets to give relevant answers to three key limitations: encapsulation, glass substrate enhanced electrical conductivity and more efficient and low-cost raw-materials. Recently, the proponent successfully addressed the hermetic devices sealing by developing a laser-assisted glass sealing procedure.Thus, BI-DSC proposal envisages the development of DSC modules 30x30cm2, containing four individual cells, and their incorporation in a 1m2 double glass sheet arrangement for BIPV with an energy efficiency of at least 9% and a lifetime of 20 years. Additionally, aiming at enhanced efficiency of the final device and decreased total costs of DSCs manufacturing, new materials will be also pursued. The following inner-components were identified as critical: carbon-based counter-electrode; carbon quantum-dots and hierarchically TiO2 photoelectrode. It is then clear that this project is divided into two research though parallel directions: a fundamental research line, contributing to the development of the new generation DSC technology; while a more applied research line targets the development of a DSC functional module that can be used to pave the way for its industrialization."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,989,300</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIC"><Rcn>111532</Rcn><Nid>10074</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Roma La Sapienza, Italy</HI><Name>Cavitation across scales: following Bubbles from Inception to Collapse</Name><PI>Carlo Massimo Casciola</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cavitation is the formation of vapor cavities inside a liquid due to low pressure. Cavitation is an ubiquitous and destructive phenomenon common to most engineering applications that deal with flowing water. At the same time, the extreme conditions realized in cavitation are increasingly exploited in medicine, chemistry, and biology. What makes cavitation unpredictable is its multiscale nature: nucleation of vapor bubbles heavily depends on micro- and nanoscale details; mesoscale phenomena, as bubble collapse, determine relevant macroscopic effects, e.g., cavitation damage. In addition, macroscopic flow conditions, such as turbulence, have a major impact on it.

The objective of the BIC project is to develop the lacking multiscale description of cavitation, by proposing new integrated numerical methods capable to perform quantitative predictions. The detailed and physically sound understanding of the multifaceted phenomena involved in cavitation (nucleation, bubble growth, transport, and collapse in turbulent flows) fostered by BIC project will result in new methods for designing fluid machinery, but also therapies in ultrasound medicine and chemical reactors. The BIC project builds upon the exceptionally broad experience of the PI and of his research group in numerical simulations of flows at different scales that include advanced atomistic simulations of nanoscale wetting phenomena, mesoscale models for multiphase flows, and particle-laden turbulent flows.

Many-core processors are now established as the way forward for computing from embedded systems to supercomputers. An emerging problem with leading-edge silicon technology is a reduction in the yield and reliability of modern processors due to high variability in the manufacture of the components and interconnect as transistor geometries shrink towards atomic scales. We are faced with the longstanding problem of how to make use of a potentially large array of parallel processors, but with the new constraint that the individual elements are the system are inherently unreliable.

This proposal describes a combination of experimental and theoretical research aimed at some of the key mysteries surrounding transport and sensing by and in complex, multicellular organisms, and the implications of those findings for the explanation of driving forces behind transitions to multicellularity. There are two main components of the research. The first involves studies of single and multicellular algae which serves as model systems for allometric scaling laws in evolution. Of particular importance are the synchronization dynamics of the eukaryotic flagella that provide motility, enhance nutrient transport, and allow phototaxis in these organisms. The second thrust involves investigation of the ubiquitous phenomenon of cytoplasmic streaming in aquatic and terrestrial plants. Despite decades of research, there is no clear consensus on the metabolic role of this persistent circulation of the fluid contents of cell. Building on recent theoretical developmnts we will study its implications for internal transport and mixing, homeostasis, and development in large cells.

Our overall objective is the development of a general functional framework for solving tensor based blind source separation (BSS) problems in biomedical data fusion, using tensor decompositions (TDs) as basic core. We claim that TDs will allow the extraction of fairly complicated sources of biomedical activity from fairly complicated sets of uni- and multimodal data. The power of the new techniques will be demonstrated for three well-chosen representative biomedical applications for which extensive expertise and fully validated datasets are available in the PI&#226;&#128;&#153;s team, namely:
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Metabolite quantification and brain tumour tissue typing using Magnetic Resonance  Spectroscopic Imaging,
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Functional monitoring including seizure detection and polysomnography,
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Cognitive brain functioning and seizure zone localization using simultaneous Electroencephalography-functional MR Imaging integration.

Solving these challenging problems requires that algorithmic progress is made in several directions:
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Algorithms need to be based on multilinear extensions of numerical linear algebra.
&#226;&#128;&#162;	New grounds for separation, such as representability in a given function class, need to be explored.
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Prior knowledge needs to be exploited via appropriate health relevant constraints.
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Biomedical data fusion requires the combination of  TDs, coupled via relevant constraints.
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Algorithms for TD updating are important for continuous long-term patient monitoring.
The algorithms are eventually integrated in an easy-to-use open source software platform that is general enough for use in other BSS applications.

Having been involved in biomedical signal processing over a period of 20 years, the PI has a good overview of the field and the opportunities.

or laser propagation, plasmas, ferromagnetism, etc. So far, the mathematical under-
standing of these equations is rather poor. In particular, we know little about the
detailed qualitative behavior of their solutions. Our point is that an apparent com-
plexity hides universal properties of these models; investigating and uncovering such
properties has started only recently. More than the equations themselves, these univer-
sal properties are essential for physical modelisation.
By considering several standard models such as the nonlinear Schrodinger, nonlinear
wave, generalized KdV equations and related geometric problems, the goal of this pro-
posal is to describe the generic global behavior of the solutions and the pro&#239;&#172;&#129;les which
emerge either for large time or by concentration due to strong nonlinear e&#239;&#172;&#128;ects, if pos-
sible through a few relevant solutions (sometimes explicit solutions, like solitons). In
order to do this, we have to elaborate di&#239;&#172;&#128;erent mathematical tools depending on the
context and the speci&#239;&#172;&#129;city of the problems. Particular emphasis will be placed on
- large time asymptotics for global solutions, decomposition of generic solutions into
sums of decoupled solitons in non integrable situations,
- description of critical phenomenon for blow up in the Hamiltonian situation, stable
or generic behavior for blow up on critical dynamics, various relevant regularisations of
the problem,
- global existence for defocusing supercritical problems and blow up dynamics in the
focusing cases.
We believe that the PI and his team have the ability to tackle these problems at present.
The proposal will open whole &#239;&#172;&#129;elds of investigation in Partial Di&#239;&#172;&#128;erential Equations in
the future, clarify and simplify our knowledge on the dynamical behavior of solutions
of these problems and provide Physicists some new insight on these models."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,079,798</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BOTMED"><Rcn>98591</Rcn><Nid>8708</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Microrobotics and Nanomedicine</Name><PI>Bradley James Nelson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The introduction of minimally invasive surgery in the 1980&#226;&#128;&#153;s created a paradigm shift in surgical procedures. Health care is now in a position to make a more dramatic leap by integrating newly developed wireless microrobotic technologies with nanomedicine to perform precisely targeted, localized endoluminal techniques. Devices capable of entering the human body through natural orifices or small incisions to deliver drugs, perform diagnostic procedures, and excise and repair tissue will be used. These new procedures will result in less trauma to the patient and faster recovery times, and will enable new therapies that have not yet been conceived. In order to realize this, many new technologies must be developed and synergistically integrated, and medical therapies for which the technology will prove successful must be aggressively pursued.

This proposed project will result in the realization of animal trials in which wireless microrobotic devices will be used to investigate a variety of extremely delicate ophthalmic therapies. The therapies to be pursued include the delivery of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to blocked retinal veins, the peeling of epiretinal membranes from the retina, and the development of diagnostic procedures based on mapping oxygen concentration at the vitreous-retina interface. With successful animal trials, a path to human trials and commercialization will follow. Clearly, many systems in the body have the potential to benefit from the endoluminal technologies that this project considers, including the digestive system, the circulatory system, the urinary system, the central nervous system, the respiratory system, the female reproductive system and even the fetus. Microrobotic retinal therapies will greatly illuminate the potential that the integration of microrobotics and nanomedicine holds for society, and greatly accelerate this trend in Europe."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,044</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BPT"><Rcn>98257</Rcn><Nid>9479</Nid><HI>Universitetet I Oslo, Norway</HI><Name>BEYOND PLATE TECTONICS</Name><PI>Trond Helge Torsvik</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Plate tectonics characterises the complex and dynamic evolution of the outer shell of the Earth in terms of rigid plates. These tectonic plates overlie and interact with the Earth's mantle, which is slowly convecting owing to energy released by the decay of radioactive nuclides in the Earth's interior. Even though links between mantle convection and plate tectonics are becoming more evident, notably through subsurface tomographic images, advances in mineral physics and improved absolute plate motion reference frames, there is still no generally accepted mechanism that consistently explains plate tectonics and mantle convection in one framework. We will integrate plate tectonics into mantle dynamics and develop a theory that explains plate motions quantitatively and dynamically. This requires consistent and detailed reconstructions of plate motions through time (Objective 1).

A new model of plate kinematics will be linked to the mantle with the aid of a new global reference frame based on moving hotspots and on palaeomagnetic data. The global reference frame will be corrected for true polar wander in order to develop a global plate motion reference frame with respect to the mantle back to Pangea (ca. 320 million years) and possibly Gondwana assembly (ca. 550 million years). The resulting plate reconstructions will constitute the input to subduction models that are meant to test the consistency between the reference frame and subduction histories. The final outcome will be a novel global subduction reference frame, to be used to unravel links between the surface and deep Earth (Objective 2)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,010</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BREAD"><Rcn>111505</Rcn><Nid>10086</Nid><HI>Universite Pierre Et Marie Curie - Paris 6, France</HI><Name>Breaking the curse of dimensionality: numerical challenges in high dimensional analysis and simulation</Name><PI>Albert Cohen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project is concerned with problems that involve a very large number of variables, and whose efficient numerical treatment is challenged by the so-called curse of dimensionality, meaning that computational complexity increases exponentially in the variable dimension.

The PI intend to establish in his host institution a scientific leadership on the mathematical understanding and numerical treatment of these problems, and to contribute to the development of this area of research through international collaborations, organization of workshops and research schools, and training of postdocs and PhD students.

High dimensional problems are ubiquitous in an increasing number of areas of scientific computing, among which statistical or active learning theory, parametric and stochastic partial differential equations, parameter optimization in numerical codes. There is a high demand from the industrial world of efficient numerical methods for treating such problems.
The practical success of various numerical algorithms, that have been developed in recent years in these application areas, is often limited to moderate dimensional setting.
In addition, these developments tend to be, as a rule, rather problem specific and not always founded on a solid mathematical analysis.

The central scientific objectives of this project are therefore: (i) to identify fundamental mathematical principles behind overcoming the curse of dimensionality, (ii) to understand how these principles enter in relevant instances of the above applications, and (iii) based on the these principles beyond particular problem classes, to develop broadly applicable numerical strategies that benefit from such mechanisms.

The performances of these strategies should be provably independent of the variable dimension, and in that sense break the curse of dimensionality. They will be tested on both synthetic benchmark tests and real world problems coming from the afore-mentioned applications."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,848,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRIDGES"><Rcn>102519</Rcn><Nid>10366</Nid><HI>Universite De Geneve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Bridging Non-Equilibrium Problems: From the Fourier Law to Gene Expression</Name><PI>Jean-Pierre Eckmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"My goal is to study several important open mathematical problems in non-equilibrium (NEQ) systems and to build a bridge between these problems and NEQ aspects of soft sciences, in particular biological questions. Traffic on this bridge is going to be two-way, the mathematics carrying a long history as a language of science towards the soft sciences, and the soft sciences fruitfully asking new questions and building new paradigms for mathematical research.
Out-of-equilibrium systems pose several fascinating problems: The Fourier law which says that resistance of a wire is proportional to its length is still presenting hard problems for research, and even the existence and the convergence to a NEQ steady state are continuously posing new puzzles, as do questions of smoothness and correlations of such states. These will be addressed with stochastic differential equations, and with particlescatterer systems, both canonical and grand-canonical. The latter are extensions of the well-known Lorentz gas and the study of hyperbolic billiards.
Another field where NEQ plays an important role is the study of glassy systems. They were studied with molecular dynamics (MD) but I have used a topological variant, which mimics astonishingly well what happens in MD simulations. The aim is to extend this to 3 dimensions, where new problems appear.
Finally, I will apply the NEQ studies to biological systems: How a system copes with the varying environment,adapting in this way to a novel type of NEQ. I will study networks of communication among neurons,which are like random graphs with the additional property of being embedded, and the arrangement of genes on chromosomes in such a way as to optimize the adaptation to the different cell types which must be produced using the same genetic information.

The available radio bandwidth gets exhausted, wireless devices start interfering with each other in this overcrowded radio spectrum, and high-capacity radio is power-hungry. Optics can offer a breakthrough, by means of the huge bandwidth of its spectrum, together with intelligent networking.
Our ambition is to make a giant step forward in wireless communications, by a revolutionary combination of novel free-space optical beam diversity techniques, an intelligently routed optical fibre platform, and flexible radio communication techniques. This hybrid technology will increase the available wireless bandwidth by several orders of magnitude, while operating very energy-efficiently.
We will investigate the use of narrowly confined optical pencil beams aided by optical beam tracking for the downstream part of the communication channel, and radio technology for upstream. The optical beams allow extremely high data rates (10-100 Gbit/s) as their carrier frequency is orders of magnitude larger than that of radio waves, and can serve many users without interference due to their spatial confinement. Moreover, they reduce the power consumption by their excellent directivity. In the (less demanding) upstream path, we will explore low-power highly-integrated radio technology for offering capacities of 3-30 Gbit/s. We combine these with intelligent optical routing techniques in the fibre backbone network, and with user localisation and tracking capabilities using advanced upstream radio techniques, in order to deliver ultra-broadband services to every user, tailored for his device.

For tele-presence to become a reality requires a further quantum-leap from the popular 3G/4G smart phones and tablet-computers.  This project will create the link-level enabling techniques of this transformational quantum leap to immersive Giga-bit 3D video communications, relying on Optical Wireless (OW) hotspots and their ad hoc networking.

As a result, the Beam-Me-Up project will contribute to job- and wealth-creation in numeorus ways, as exemplified by the often-quoted economic benefits of 3G/4G phones on businesses.  From an environmental perspective, flawless tele-presence has the potential of eliminating millions of flights/trips and hence will considerably reduce CO2 emissions, whilst reducing the related business-costs as well as saving precious time for the work-force.  However, the transfiguration of the voice-only phone into today's intelligent smart phone was facilitated by a 1000-fold transmission-rate increase, which would result in a proportionally increased power consumption, CO2 emissions and in a soaring energy-bill.  Tele-presence based on crisp Avatar-style 3D video has even higher bitrates and energy consumption. These radically new high-rate 3D tele-presence services can no longer be accommodated in the severely congested Radio Frequency (RF) band.

The method is computationally efficient so that it can be used in climate models. For the first time cloud droplet formation on multi-component particles can be represented based on first principles rather than parameterisations. This allows for a direct coupling in models between aerosol chemical composition and the continuum between hazes and clouds as a function of ambient relative humidity.  We will apply the method in a new nested global-limited area model system to study atmospheric chemistry   climate interactions and anthropogenic influences. We will focus on the Mediterranean region because it is a hot spot in climate change exposed to drying and air pollution. The limited area model will also be applied as cloud-resolving model to study aerosol influences on precipitation and storm development. By simulating realistic meteorological conditions at high spatial resolution our method can be straightforwardly tested against observations.  Central questions are: - How does the simulated haze-cloud continuum compare with remote sensing measurements and what is the consequence of abandoning the traditional and artificial distinction between aerosols and clouds?  - How are cloud and precipitation formation influenced by atmospheric chemical composition changes? - To what extent do haze and cloud formation in polluted air exert forcings of synoptic meteorological conditions and climate?  - Can aerosol pollution in the Mediterranean region exacerbate the predicted   and observed   drying in a changing climate? The model system is user-friendly and will facilitate air quality and climate studies by regional scientists. The project will be part of the Energy, Environment and Water Centre of the newly founded Cyprus Institute, provide input to climate impact assessments and contribute to a regional outreach programme.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,196,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAP"><Rcn>99542</Rcn><Nid>9268</Nid><HI>Bar Ilan University, Israel</HI><Name>Computers Arguing with People</Name><PI>Sarit Kraus</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"An important form of negotiation is argumentation. This is the ability to argue and to persuade the other party to accept a desired agreement, to acquire or give information, to coordinate goals and actions, and to find and verify evidence. This is a key capability in negotiating with humans.
While automated negotiations between software agents can often exchange offers and counteroffers, humans require persuasion. This challenges the design of agents arguing with people, with the objective that the outcome of the negotiation will meet the preferences of the arguer agent.
CAP&#226;&#128;&#153;s objective is to enable automated agents to argue and persuade humans.
To achieve this, we intend to develop the following key components:
1) The extension of current game theory models of persuasion and bargaining to more realistic settings, 2) Algorithms and heuristics for generation and evaluation of arguments during negotiation with people, 3) Algorithms and heuristics for managing inconsistent views of the negotiation environment, and decision procedures for revelation, signalling, and requesting information, 4) The revision and update of the agent&#226;&#128;&#153;s mental state and incorporation of social context, 5) Identifying strategies for expressing emotions in negotiations, 6) Technology for general opponent modelling from sparse and noisy data.
To demonstrate the developed methods, we will implement two training systems  for people to improve their interviewing capabilities, and for training negotiators in inter-culture negotiations.
CAP will revolutionise the state of the art of automated systems negotiating with people. It will also create breakthroughs in the research of multi-agent systems in general, and will change paradigms by providing new directions for the way computers interact with people."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,334,057</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAPRI"><Rcn>101437</Rcn><Nid>10477</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Chemical and photochemical dynamics of reactions in solution</Name><PI>Andrew John Orr-Ewing</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Ultrafast laser methods will be employed to examine the dynamics of chemical and photochemical reactions in liquid solutions.  By contrasting the solution phase dynamics with those observed for isolated collisions in the gas phase, the fundamental role of solvent on chemical pathways will be explored at a molecular level.  The experimental studies will be complemented by computational simulations that explicitly include treatment of the effects of solvent on reaction energy pathways and reactant and product motions.

The research addresses a major challenge in Chemistry to understand the role of solvent on the mechanisms of chemical reactions.  Questions that will be examined include how the solvent modifies reaction barriers and other regions of the reaction potential energy surface (PESs), alters the couplings between PESs, most importantly at conical intersections between electronic states, influences and constrains the dynamical stereochemistry of passage through transition states, and dissipates excess product energy.

The experimental strategy will be to obtain absorption spectra of transient species with lifetimes of ~100 fs &#226;&#128;&#147; 1000 ps using broad bandwidth light sources in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions.  Time-evolutions of such spectra reveal the formation and decay of short-lived species that might be highly reactive radicals or internally (vibrationally and electronically) excited molecules.  The transient species decay by reaction or energy loss to the solvent.  Statistical mechanical theories of reactions in solution treat such processes using linear response theory, but the experimental data will challenge this paradigm by seeking evidence for breakdown of the linear response interaction of solvent and solute on short timescales because of microscopic chemical dynamics that perturb the solvent structure.  The work will build on our pioneering experiments at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory that prove the feasilbility of the methods."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,666,684</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CARBONANOBRIDGE"><Rcn>89738</Rcn><Nid>12961</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Trieste, Italy</HI><Name>Neuron Networking with Nano Bridges via the Synthesis and Integration of Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes</Name><PI>Maurizio Prato</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"We propose the development of novel nanodevices, such as nanoscale bridges and nanovectors, based on functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT) for manipulating neurons and neuronal network activity in vitro.

An unconventional strategy will be represented by the electrical characterization of micro and nano patterned substrates by AFM and conductive tip AFM, both before and after neurons have grown on the substrates.

Astrophysical observations in the optical to infrared wavelengths of circumstellar disks around young stars have shown the existence in the inner disk of high-temperature processing of the dust. X-ray observations of T-Tauri stars revealed that they exhibit X-ray flare enhancements by several orders of magnitude. The work we have performed over the last years on the isotopic analysis of either solar wind trapped in lunar soils or of Ca-, Al-rich inclusions and chondrules from primitive chondrites, has allowed us to link some of these astrophysical observations around young stars with processes, such as irradiation by energetic particles and UV light, which took place around the T-Tauri Sun.   The aim of this project is to make decisive progress in our understanding of the early solar system though the development of in situ high-precision isotopic measurements by ion microprobe in extra-terrestrial matter. The project will be focused on the exploration of the variations in the isotopic composition of O and Mg and in the concentration of short-lived radioactive nuclides, such as 26Al and 10Be, with half-lives shorter than 1.5 millions years. A special emphasis will be put on the search for nuclides with very short half-lives such as 32Si (650 years) and 14C (5730 years), nuclides which have never been discovered yet in meteorites. These new data will bring critical information on, for instance, the astrophysical context for the formation of the Sun and the first solids in the accretion disk, or the timing and the processes by which protoplanets were formed and destroyed close to the Sun during the first 2 million years of the lifetime of the Solar System.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,270,419</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHEMAGEB"><Rcn>107852</Rcn><Nid>11242</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior Deinvestigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>CHEMometric and High-throughput Omics Analytical Methods for Assessment of Global Change Effects on Environmental and Biological Systems</Name><PI>Roman Tauler Ferrer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>We propose to develop new chemometric and high-throughput analytical methods to assess the effects of environmental and climate changes on target biological systems which are representative of ecosystems. This project will combine powerful chemometric and analytical high-throughput methodologies with toxicological tests to examine the effects of environmental stressors (like chemical pollution) and of climate change (like temperature, water scarcity or food shortage), on genomic and metabonomic profiles of target biological systems. The complex nature of experimental data produced by high-throughput analytical techniques, such as DNA microarrays, hyphenated chromatography-mass spectrometry or multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, requires powerful data analysis tools to extract, summarize and interpret the large amount of information that such megavariate data sets may contain. There is a need to improve and automate every step in the analysis of the data generated from genomic and metabonomic studies using new chemometric and multi- and megavariate tools. The main purpose of this project is to develop such tools. As a result of the whole study, a detailed report on the effects of global change and chemical pollution on the genomic and metabonomic profiles of a selected set of representative target biological systems will be delivered and used for global risk assessment.

Instrumentation to probe the physics and chemistry in low-mass star-forming regions has so far lacked spatial resolution. I propose here an integrated observational-modeling-laboratory program to survey protostars and disks on the relevant scales of 1-50 AU where planet formation takes place. The observations are centered on new data coming from the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the analysis includes unique new data from key programs on Herschel, Spitzer and VLT that I am (co-)leading. The combination of millimeter and infrared data allows the full range of temperatures from 10-2000 K in star- and planet- forming regions to be probed, for both gas and solids. The molecular line data are used as diagnostics of physical parameters (such as UV field, cosmic ray ionization rate, kinematics, mixing, shock strength, grain growth, gas/dust ratios) as well as to follow the chemistry of water and complex organic molecules from cores to disks, which ultimately may be delivered to terrestrial planets. The implications for the history of volatile material in our own solar systen and exo-planetary atmospheres will be assessed by comparing models and data with cometary taxonomy and, ultimately, feeding them into planet population synthesis models. Altogether, this program will bring the link between interstellar chemistry and solar system and exo-planetary research to a new level.

In this project, we consider three challenges.

The first one is the multimodality. Indeed, with the multiplication of kinds of sensors, in many areas like biomedical signal processing, hyperspectral imaging, etc. there are many ways for recording the same physical phenomenon leading thus to multimodal data. Multimodality has been studied in the framework of human-computer interface or in data fusion, but never at the signal level. The objective is to provide a general framework for modeling classical multimodal properties, like complementarity, redundancy, equivalence, etc. as of function of source signals.

The second challenge is nonlinearity. Indeed, there exist a few cases where the mixtures are essentially nonlinear, e.g. with chemical sensors. The main objective is to enlarge results on identifiability conditions for new classes of nonlinearities and priors on sources.

The third challenge is the data size. For high-dimension data (e.g. EEG or MRI in brain imaging), separating all the sources is neither tractable nor relevant, since one would like to only extract the useful sources. Conversely, for a small number of sensors, especially smaller than the number of sources, it is again necessary to only focus on the useful signals. The main objective is to develop generic approaches able to only extract useful signals, based on simple reference signal, modeling weak properties of the useful signal.

Finally, validation and relevant modeling must be based on actual signals and problems. In this project, theoretical results and algorithms will be developed in interaction with applications in biomedical engineering (brain-computer interface, EEG, fMRI), chemical engineering, audio-visual scene analysis and hyperspectral imaging.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,390</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHIRALLCARBON"><Rcn>107851</Rcn><Nid>12892</Nid><HI>Universidad Complutense De Madrid, Spain</HI><Name>Chiral Allotropes of Carbon</Name><PI>Nazario Mart&#195;&#173;n</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The aim of the present project is to answer fundamental questions about how to introduce chirality into a variety of carbon nanostructures and how it modifies the properties in the search for new applications in materials science and nanotecnology.

It is now clear that to sample representative volumes of the high-redshift universe requires ultra-deep near-infrared, mid-infrared and sub-mm surveys covering over ~1 sq. degree. Until now this has not been possible, but this field is about to be revolutionized by the introduction of a new generation of wide-field facilities in the next year. Specifically, 2009 will see the commissioning of the new near-infrared VISTA survey telescope in Chile, the new SCUBA2 sub-mm camera on the JCMT in Hawaii, the far-infrared Herschel Space Observatory, and the near-infrared camera WFC3 in the Hubble Space Telescope.

The chromosphere harbours and constrains the mass and energy loading processes that define the heating of the corona, the acceleration and the composition of the solar wind, and the energetics and triggering of solar outbursts (filament eruptions, flares, coronal mass ejections) that govern near-Earth space weather and affect mankind's technological environment.

CHROMPHYS targets the following fundamental physics questions about the chromospheric role in the mass and energy loading of the corona:

- Which types of non-thermal energy dominate in the chromosphere and beyond?

- How does the chromosphere regulate mass and energy supply to the corona and the solar wind?

- How do magnetic flux and matter rise through the chromosphere?

- How does the chromosphere affect the free magnetic energy loading that leads to solar eruptions?

CHROMPHYS proposes to answer these by producing a new, physics based vista of the chromosphere through a three-fold effort:

- develop the techniques of high-resolution numerical MHD physics to the level needed to realistically predict and analyse small-scale  chromospheric structure and dynamics,

- optimise and calibrate diverse observational diagnostics by synthesizing these in detail from the simulations, and

- obtain and analyse data from IRIS using these diagnostics complemented by data from other space missions and the best solar telescopes on the ground."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,487,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CIF"><Rcn>94090</Rcn><Nid>11311</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Complex Interfacial Flows: From the Nano- to the Macro-Scale</Name><PI>Serafim Kalliadasis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"A wide variety of natural phenomena and technological applications involve flow, transport and chemical reactions taking place on or near fluid-solid or fluid-fluid interfaces. From gravity currents under water and lava flows to heat and mass transport processes in engineering applications and to the rapidly developing field of microfluidics. Both equilibrium properties of a fluid and transportcoefficients are modified in the vicinity of interfaces. The effect of these changes is crucial in the behavior of ultra-thin fluidfilms and fluid motion in microchannels of micro-electromechanical systems, but is essential as well in macroscopic phenomena involving interfacial singularities, such as thin-film rupture and motion of three-phase contact lines associated e.g. with droplet spreading. Interface boundaries are mesoscopic structures. While material properties vary smoothly at macroscopic distances from an interface, gradients in the normal direction of conserved parameters, such as density, are steep with strong variations as the molecular scale in the neighborhood of the interface is approached. This brings about a contradiction between the need in macroscopic description and a necessity to take into consideration microscopic factors that come to influence the fluid motion and transport on incommensurately larger scales. The aim of the proposed research is to develop a class of novel continuous models bridging the gap between molecular dynamics and conventional hydrodynamics and applicable at mesoscopic distances from gas-liquid and fluid-solid interfaces. A combination of analytical techniques, numerical modeling and computer-aided multiscale analysis will be employed. The results of the proposed work will greatly contribute to the fundamental understanding of mesoscopic non-equilibrium phenomena in the vicinity of interfaces and to the development of novel computational methods combining the advantages of molecular and continuous models."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,273,788</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CISS"><Rcn>110274</Rcn><Nid>10234</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity</Name><PI>Ron Naaman</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The overall objective is to fully understand  the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect, which was discovered recently. It was found that the transmission or conduction of electrons through chiral molecules is spin dependent. The CISS effect is a change in the pradigm that assumed that any spin manipulation requiers magnetic materials or materials with high spin-orbit coupling. These unexpected new findings open new possibilities for  applying chiral molecules in spintronics applications and may provide new insights on electron transfer processes in Biology.
The specific goals of the proposed research are
(i) To establish the parameters that affect the magnitude of the CISS effect.
(ii) To demonstrate spintronics devices (memory and transistors) that are based on the CISS effect.
(iii) To investigate  the role of CISS in electron transfer in biology related systems.
The experiments will be performed applying a combination of experimental methods including photoelectron spectroscopy, single molecule conduction, light-induced electron transfer, and spin specific conduction through magneto-electric devices.
The project has a potential to have very large impact on various fields from Physics to Biology.

This is motivated by the fact that the current models which have been developed for the combustion of constituents of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuels do a reasonable job in predicting auto-ignition and flame propagation parameters, and the formation of the main regulated pollutants. However their success rate deteriorates sharply in the prediction of the formation of minor products (alkenes, dienes, aromatics, aldehydes) and soot nano-particles, which have a deleterious impact on both the environment and on human health. At the same time, despite an increasing emphasis in shifting from hydrocarbon fossil fuels to bio-fuels (particularly bioethanol and biodiesel), there is a great lack of chemical models for the combustion of oxygenated reactants. The main scientific focus will then be to enlarge and deepen the understanding of the reaction mechanisms and pathways associated with the combustion of an increased range of fuels (hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds) and to elucidate the formation of a large number of hazardous minor pollutants. The core of the project is to describe at a fundamental level more accurately the reactive chemistry of minor pollutants within extensively validated detailed mechanisms for not only traditional fuels, but also innovative surrogates, describing the complex chemistry of new environmentally important bio-fuels. At the level of individual reactions rate constants, generalized rate constant classes and molecular data will be enhanced by using techniques based on quantum mechanics and on statistical mechanics.  Experimental data for validation will be obtained in well defined laboratory reactors by using analytical methods of increased accuracy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,869,450</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CME"><Rcn>102190</Rcn><Nid>10703</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Concurrency Made Easy</Name><PI>Bertrand Philippe Meyer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The &#226;&#128;&#156;Concurrency Made Easy&#226;&#128;&#157; project is an attempt to achieve a conceptual breakthrough on the most daunting challenge in information technology today: mastering concurrency.

Increases in performance can no longer happen through raw hardware speed, but only through concurrency, as in multicore architectures. Concurrency is also critical for networking, cloud computing and the progress of natural sciences. Software support for these advances lags, mired in concepts from the 1960s such as semaphores. Existing formal models are hard to apply in practice. Incremental progress is not sufficient; neither are techniques that place the burden on programmers, who cannot all be expected to become concurrency experts. The CME project attempts a major shift on the side of the supporting technology: languages, formal models, verification techniques. The core idea of the CME project is to make concurrency easy for programmers, by building on established ideas of modern programming methodology (object technology, Design by Contract) shifting the concurrency difficulties to the internals of the model and implementation.
The project includes the following elements.
1. Sound conceptual model for concurrency. The starting point is the influential previous work of the PI: concepts of object-oriented design, particularly Design by Contract, and the SCOOP concurrency model.
2. Reference implementation, integrated into an IDE.
3. Performance analysis.
4. Theory and formal basis, including full semantics.

The basic macroscopic theory of how cosmic rays gain energy during multiple shock crossings is well known, but the microphysics of the interaction between cosmic rays (CR) and the MHD background fluid remained poorly understood before the recent discovery of a new non-resonant instability by which the CR precursor could greatly amplify the ambient magnetic field. The aims of the project are: 1) to develop the first self-consistent non-linear simulation of the CR/MHD interaction; to calculate the magnitude of the saturated magnetic field and the maximum energy to which CR are accelerated. We will characterise the structure of the amplified magnetic field and compare it with x-ray observations of the time-evolving outer shock of supernova remnants (SNR). We will investigate the effect of various orientations of the shock relative to the ambient magnetic field, the effect of non-diffusive transport on the energy spectrum and CR escape from the SNR, and how these match observation. 2) to extend the simulation to relativistic shocks as found in gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and active galactic nuclei (AGN); to establish whether the non-resonant instability operates effectively at relativistic shock velocities, whether it explains the large magnetic field found in GRB, and determine the maximum CR energy achieved by relativistic shocks. 3) to investigate high density shocks in GRB, x-ray flashes (XRF) and supernovae (SN) where radiative processes, pair production and other particle/photon and particle/particle interactions are important. We shall investigate CR acceleration on SN shock breakout and very young SNR as a possible source of very high energy CR.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>900,024</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CMetC"><Rcn>110353</Rcn><Nid>12419</Nid><HI>Technion - Israel Institute Of Technology, Israel</HI><Name>Selective Carbon-Carbon Bond Activation: A Wellspring of Untapped Reactivity</Name><PI>Ilan Marek</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The creation of new molecular entities and subsequent exploitation of their properties is central to a broad spectrum of research disciplines from medicine to materials. Most &#226;&#128;&#147;if not all- of the efforts of organic chemists were directed to the development of creative strategies to built carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds in a predictable and efficient manner. But is the creation of new bonds the only approach that organic chemistry should follow? Could we design the synthesis of challenging molecular skeleton no more through the construction of carbon-carbon bonds but rather through selective cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds (C-C bond activation)? The goal of this work is to develop powerful synthetic approaches for the selective C-C bond activation and demonstrate that it has the potential to be a general principle in organic synthesis for the regio-, diastereo- and even enantiomerically enriched preparation of adducts despite that C-C single bonds belong among the least reactive functional groups in chemistry. The realization of this synthetic potential requires the ability to functionalize selectively one C-C bond in compounds containing many such bonds and an array of functional groups. This site selective C-C bond activation is one of the greatest challenges that must be met to be used widely in complex-molecular synthesis. To emphasize the practicality of C-C bond activation, we will prepare in a single-pot operation challenging molecular framework possessing various stereogenic centers from very simple starting materials through selective C-C bond activation. Ideally, alkenes will be in-situ transformed into alkanes that will subsequently undergo the C-C activation even in the presence of functional group. This work will lead to ground-breaking advances when non-strained cycloalkanes (cyclopentane, cyclohexane) will undergo this smooth C-C bond activation with friendly and non toxic organometallic species.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,367,495</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COCO2CASA"><Rcn>110623</Rcn><Nid>12455</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Modeling Stellar Collapse and Explosion: Evolving Progenitor Stars to Supernova Remnants</Name><PI>Hans-Thomas Janka</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project intends to make groundbreaking progress towards the solution of one of the most pestering and long-standing riddles of stellar astrophysics, namely the question how massive stars explode as supernovae (SNe).
State-of-the-art simulations in two dimensions (2D) now yield neutrino-powered (through underenergetic) explosions for a growing variety of progenitors and thus support the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism. However, sophisticated, fully self-consistent, 3D simulations are still lacking, the spherical symmetry of the progenitor star models is becoming a serious handicap, and better exploitation of observational constraints of the SN mechanism is urgently needed.
For these reasons we plan a novel, comprehensive modeling approach, in which 3D hydrodynamics including all relevant microphysics will not only be employed for the launch phase of the SN blast wave by neutrino-energy deposition. Different from previous initiatives, 3D hydrodynamics will also be applied to the final stages of convective shell burning in the progenitor core before collapse in order to derive --for the first time-- self-consistent, multidimensional progenitor data for adopting them as initial conditions in the SN modeling. Moreover, the 3D explosion simulations will be continued consistently through the long-time evolution of the SN outburst into the gaseous remnant phase. This challenging approach promises fundamentally new insights into the processes that trigger and shape SN explosions and will revise our understanding of how SNe depend on the properties of their progenitor stars. Moreover, heading for a direct comparison of the derived theoretical models with nearby young SN remnants like Crab, Cassiopeia A, and SN 1987A, whose 3D morphology and composition are currently unfolded in stunning detail by multiwavelength observations, the project will lay the foundations of a powerful, innovative, and so far not exploited way of probing the physics deep inside the SN core."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,898,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CODE"><Rcn>111137</Rcn><Nid>10130</Nid><HI>Aalto-Korkeakoulusaatio, Finland</HI><Name>Condensation in designed systems</Name><PI>P&#195;&#164;ivi Elina T&#195;&#182;rm&#195;&#164;</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Quantum coherent phenomena, especially marcoscopic quantum coherence, are among the most striking predictions of quantum mechanics.

Here my objective is to extend the realm of Bose-Einstein condensation into new conceptual and practical directions. I focus on the role of a hybrid character of the object that condenses and on the role of non-equilibrium in the BEC phenomenon. The work is mostly theoretical but has also an experimental part. I study two new types of hybrids, fundamentally different from each other. First, I consider pairing and superfluidity in a mixed geometry. Experimental realization of mixed geometries is becoming feasible in ultracold gases. Second, I explore the possibility of finding novel hybrids of light and matter excitations that may display condensation. By combining insight from these two cases, my goal is to understand how the hybrid and non-equilibrium nature can be exploited to design desirable properties, such as high critical temperatures. In particular, in case of the new light-matter hybrids, the goal is to provide realistic scenarios for, and also experimentally demonstrate, a room temperature BEC."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,559,608</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CODITA"><Rcn>102627</Rcn><Nid>10925</Nid><HI>University Of Leeds, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Cosmic Dust in the Terrestrial Atmosphere</Name><PI>John Maurice Campbell Plane</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project addresses a fundamental problem &#226;&#128;&#147; the size of the cosmic dust input to the earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s atmosphere. Zodiacal cloud observations and spaceborne dust detection indicate a daily input of 100 &#226;&#128;&#147; 300 tonnes, in agreement with the accumulation rates of cosmic elements (e.g. Ir, Pt) in polar ice cores and deep-sea sediments. In contrast, measurements in the middle atmosphere &#226;&#128;&#147; by radar, lidar, high-flying aircraft and satellite remote sensing &#226;&#128;&#147; indicate that the input is only 5 - 50 tonnes. The aim of CODITA is to resolve this huge discrepancy.

There are two reasons why this matters. First, if the upper range of estimates is correct, then vertical transport in the middle atmosphere must be considerably faster than generally believed; whereas if the lower range is correct, then our understanding of dust evolution in the solar system, and transport from the middle atmosphere to the surface, will need substantial revision. Second, cosmic dust particles enter the atmosphere at high speeds and in most cases completely ablate. The resulting metals injected into the atmosphere are involved in a diverse range of phenomena, including: formation of layers of metal atoms and ions; nucleation of noctilucent clouds; impacts on stratospheric aerosols and O3 chemistry (which need to be evaluated against the background of a cooling stratosphere and geo-engineering plans to increase sulphate aerosol); and fertilization of the ocean with bio-available Fe, which has potential climate feedbacks.

CODITA will use laboratory studies to target poorly understood aspects of this problem, such as the nature of the ablation process itself, the formation of meteoric smoke particles, and their role in ice nucleation and the freezing of polar stratospheric clouds. The results will be incorporated into a chemistry-climate model of the whole atmosphere, so that it will be possible, for the first time, to model the effects of cosmic dust self-consistently from the thermosphere to the surface."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,484,369</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COGNET"><Rcn>108517</Rcn><Nid>9410</Nid><HI>The Provost, Fellows, Foundation Scholars &amp; The Other Members Of Board Of The College Of The Holy &amp; Undivided Trinity Of Queen Elizabeth Near Dublin, Ireland</HI><Name>Cognitive Networks for Intelligent Materials and Devices</Name><PI>John Boland</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"COGnitive NETwork (COGNET) is a new technology platform for materials, sensor and device design that exploits unique and hitherto unrecognised properties of random nanowire (NW) networks.

As such, noncommutative ring theory is an area which has the potential to produce developments in many areas and in an efficient manner. The main aim of the project is to develop methods which could be applicable not only in ring theory but also in other areas, and then apply them to solve several important open questions in mathematics. The Principal Investigator, along with two PhD students and two post doctorates, propose to: study basic open questions on infinite dimensional associative noncommutative algebras; pool their expertise so as to tackle problems from a number of related areas of mathematics using noncommutative ring theory, and develop new approaches to existing problems that will benefit future researchers. A part of our methodology would be to first improve (in some cases) Bergman's Diamond Lemma, and then apply it to several open problems. The Diamond Lemma gives bases for the algebras defined by given sets of relations. In general, it is very difficult to determine if the algebra given by a concrete set of relations is non-trivial or infinite dimensional.  Our approach is to introduce smaller rings, which we will call platinum rings. The next step would then be to apply the Diamond Lemma to the platinum ring instead of the original rings. Such results would have many applications in group theory, noncommutative projective geometry, nonassociative algebras and no doubt other areas as well."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,406,551</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COLSTRUCTION"><Rcn>88548</Rcn><Nid>11853</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Numerical Design of Self Assembly of Complex Colloidal Structures</Name><PI>Daniel Frenkel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>I propose to use computer simulations to predict the thermodynamic stability and kinetics of formation of three-dimensional structures of DNA-linked colloids. I then aim to go beyond simple binary structures and use simulation to explore novel strategies to build multi-component three-dimensional colloidal structures.  At present, the complexity of self-assembled colloidal crystals is limited: ordered structures with more than two distinct components are rare. To make more complex structures, particles should bind selectively to their designated neighbours. This may be achieved by coating colloids with single-stranded DNA that hybridises selectively with the complementary sequence on another colloid. However, there are many practical obstacles to go from there to the self assembly of multi-component structures. In order to make progress, we need to understand the factors that determine the thermodynamic stability and, even more importantly, the kinetics of formation of complex structures. Such a numerical study will require a wide range of numerical techniques, many of which do not yet exist.

Limitations of current procedures for developing material-based innovative technologies in engineering, are often made manifest; many times only a catalog, or a data basis, of materials is available and these new technologies have to adapt to them, in the same way that the users of ready-to-wear have to take from the shop the costume that fits them better, but not the one that fits them properly. This constitutes an enormous limitation for the intended goals and scope. Certainly, availability of materials specifically designed by goal-oriented methods could eradicate that limitation, but this purpose faces the bounds of experimental procedures of material design, commonly based on trial and error procedures.
Computational mechanics, with the emerging Computational Materials Design (CMD) research field, has much to offer in this respect.

Starting point will be recent advances in colloid synthesis strategies that have led to a spectacular array of colloids of different shapes, compositions, patterns and functionalities. These allow us to investigate the influence of anisotropy in shape and interactions on aggregation and self-assembly in colloidal suspensions and mixtures. Using responsive particles we will implement colloidal lock-and-key mechanisms and then assemble a library of &#226;&#128;&#156;colloidal molecules&#226;&#128;&#157; with well-defined and externally tunable binding sites using microfluidics-based and externally controlled fabrication and sorting principles. We will use them to explore the equilibrium phase behavior of particle systems interacting through a finite number of binding sites. In parallel, we will exploit them and investigate colloid self-assembly into well-defined nanostructures. Here we aim at achieving much more refined control than currently possible by implementing a protein-inspired approach to controlled self-assembly. We combine molecule-like colloidal building blocks that possess directional interactions and externally triggerable specific recognition sites with directed self-assembly where external fields not only facilitate assembly, but also allow fabricating novel structures. We will use the tunable combination of different contributions to the interaction potential between the colloidal building blocks and the ability to create chirality in the assembly to establish the requirements for the controlled formation of tubular shells and thus create a colloid-based minimal model of synthetic virus capsid proteins."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COMPAT"><Rcn>111533</Rcn><Nid>12578</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Torino, Italy</HI><Name>Complex Patterns for Strongly Interacting Dynamical Systems</Name><PI>Susanna Terracini</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This project focuses on nontrivial solutions of systems of differential equations characterized by strongly nonlinear interactions. We are interested in the effect of the nonlinearities on the emergence of non trivial self-organized structures. Such patterns correspond to selected solutions of the differential system possessing special symmetries or shadowing particular shapes. We want to understand, from the
mathematical point of view, what are the main mechanisms involved in the aggregation process in terms of the global variational structure of the problem. Following this common thread, we deal with both with the classical N-body problem of Celestial Mechanics, where interactions feature attractive singularities, and competition-diffusion systems, where pattern formation is driven by strongly repulsive forces. More
precisely, we are interested in periodic and bounded solutions, parabolic trajectories with the final intent to build complex motions and possibly obtain the symbolic dynamics for the general N&#226;&#128;&#147;body problem. On the other hand, we deal with elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic systems of differential equations with strongly competing interaction terms, modeling both the dynamics of competing populations (Lotka-
Volterra systems) and other interesting physical phenomena, among which the phase segregation of solitary waves of Gross-Pitaevskii systems arising in the study of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates.

The ability to concentrate light in subwavelength dimensions and to locally enhance the strength of the electromagnetic field in a tailored fashion opened several new fields in materials research, such as tailoring the linear and nonlinear properties of optical materials at will. So-called metamaterials allow now to design and realize unprecedented optical properties on the submicrometer level and hence tailor dispersion as well as real and imaginary parts of the linear and nonlinear refractive indices as a function of wavelength and wavevector.

Our ability to create two- and three-dimensional nanostructures with advanced fabrication technologies have led to the new era of complex plasmonics. We are able to tailor the spectral response of complex metallic nanostructures, including the creation of very sharp and narrow resonances. In combination with strong field localization and hence large dependence on the material properties of the nanostructure geometry and its surrounding, unique sensors with sensitivities close to fundamental limits should be within reach.

In my proposal, I would like to explore the ultimate limits of light-matter interaction using complex plasmonic nanostructures. I would like to apply them to different physical, chemical, and biological situations and undertake the first steps from fundamental insight into first applications. Namely, I would like to investigate complex plasmonics in four different contexts: single molecule reactions on complex surfaces, antenna-enhanced structural analysis of large single molecules, such as proteins, motion sensing of conformational changes of single molecules, as well as chiral sensing down to the single molecule level, hence ultimately being able to distinguish a single D-glucose molecule from its L-glucose enantiomer. This would bridge the gap between nanophysics, chemistry, and biology."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COMPSELF"><Rcn>98068</Rcn><Nid>8795</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Self-Organisation: From Molecules to Matter</Name><PI>David John Wales</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This research proposal concerns the theory and computer simulation of self-organisation to predict properties and to design systems with specified characteristics. The key computational challenge is to explore the energy landscape for complex systems and make predictions to characterise efficient self-organisation on experimental time and length scales. Novel methodology is required to overcome the problems of broken ergodicity and rare events. The theoretical framework exploits stationary points of the potential energy landscape to access the required time and length scales. Applications include self-assembly of mesoscopic structures from coarse-grained building blocks and all-atom simulations of conformational changes in specific proteins and nucleic acids.

We aim to establish design principles for efficient self-assembly by developing novel tools for visualising and exploration of the corresponding landscape. Here, a key issue is how the interactions between the constituent particles determine the organisation of the energy landscape. Identifying which features lead to successful self-assembly and which disrupt such ordering will lead to a wide range of important applications, ranging from design of new materials to identifying new anti-viral drugs. The same methodology will be applied to detailed models of specific biomolecules, where self-organisation into alternative structures is associated with disease. Global optimisation will be employed in structure prediction for variable pathogens, such as human influenza virus. Pathways for folding and misfolding of specific proteins and nucleic acids will be characterised using novel rare events methodology, providing insight into intermediates that could serve as potential drug targets.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,069,374</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CONFRA"><Rcn>89103</Rcn><Nid>9757</Nid><HI>Universite De Geneve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Conformal fractals in analysis, dynamics, physics</Name><PI>Stanislav Smirnov</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The goal of this project is to study conformally invariant fractal structures from the perspectives of analysis, dynamics, probability, geometry and physics, emphasizing interrelations of these fields.  In the last two decades such structures emerged in several areas: continuum scaling limits of 2D critical models in statistical physics (percolation, Ising model); extremal configurations for various problems in complex analysis (multifractal harmonic measures, coefficient growth of univalent maps, Brennan's conjecture); chaotic sets for complex dynamical systems (Julia sets, Kleinian groups).  Capitalizing on recent successes, I plan to continue my work in these areas, exploiting their interactions and connections to physics. I intend to achieve at least some of the following goals: * To establish that several critical lattice models have conformally invariant scaling limits, by building upon results on percolation and Ising models and finding discrete holomorphic observables. * To study geometric properties of arising fractal curves and random fields by connecting them to Schramm's SLE curves and Gaussian Free Fields. * To investigate massive scaling limits by describing them geometrically with generalizations of SLEs. * To lay mathematical framework behind relevant physical notions, such as Coulomb Gas (by relating height functions to GFFs) and Quantum Gravity (by identifying limits of random planar graphs with Liouville QGs).  * To improve known bounds in several old questions in complex analysis by studying multifractal spectra of harmonic measures.  * To estimate extremal behavior of such spectra by using holomorphic motions of (quasi) conformal maps and thermodynamic formalism.  * To understand nature of extremal multifractals for harmonic measure by studying random and dynamical fractals.  The topics involved range from century old to very young ones. Recently connections between them started to emerge, opening exciting possibilities for new developments in some long standing open problems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,278,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CONSTANS"><Rcn>111229</Rcn><Nid>10115</Nid><HI>Stichting Voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek Der Materie - Fom, Netherlands</HI><Name>Control of the Structure of Light at the Nanoscale</Name><PI>Laurens Kuipers</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"In the last decade, the fields of nanoplasmonics and photonic crystals have opened up the nanoscale for optical control. Both the flow and emission of light can be controlled at these small length scales, giving rise to new science and applications. Interestingly, freely propagating light beams can already contain nanoscale features, i.e. optical singularities. Little is known about this nanoscale structure of light.
I propose to (1) reveal the structure of light at the nanoscale and its interaction with geometrical structures or other light structures; and (2) achieve full spatio-temporal control of the nanoscale structure of light. Crucial to achieving these goals are technological innovations, which will be crosscutting objectives. These include the first nonlinear vectorial scanning near-field microscope and novel near-field probes allowing access to new combinations of vector fields.
This next step in the field of nano-optics is possible due to recent breakthroughs in the control and visualization of light at the nanoscale obtained in my group. I will combine newly acquired access to the vectorial nature of light with its active control to investigate how (deep-) subwavelength structures of light of different frequencies affect each other when coupled through a nonlinear interaction in a nanostructured material. In parallel I will focus on optical singularities. Because of their extreme size, small changes in their position will lead to huge effects in the local light fields, opening up potential for all-optical and therefore ultrafast control.
The research will lead to innovations in the visualization and control of light at the nanoscale, access to the magnetic component of light, nanoscale nonlinear optics and coherent control of light fields. The knowledge gain will be crucial for applications like ultrasensitive biosensors based on superchiral light, ultrafast magneto-optics and nanoscale quantum optics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COORDSPACE"><Rcn>88925</Rcn><Nid>12983</Nid><HI>The University Of Nottingham, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Chemistry of Coordination Space: Extraction, Storage, Activation and Catalysis</Name><PI>Martin Schroder</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The Applicant has an outstanding record of achievement and an international reputation for independent research across many areas of metal coordination chemistry.

This will allow us not only to probe and better understand the fundamental behaviour of (nano) materials at an atomic level but also to guide technology towards new horizons. The installation in 2009 of a new and unique electron microscope with a real space resolution of 50 pm and an energy resolution of 100 meV will make it possible to perform unique experiments. We believe that the position of atoms at an interface or at a surface can be determined with a precision of 1 pm; this precision is essential as input for modelling the materials properties. It will be first applied to explain the fascinating behaviour of multilayer ceramic materials. The new experimental limits will also allow us to literally count the number of atoms within an atomic columns; particularly counting the number of foreign atoms. This will not only require experimental skills, but also theoretical support. A real challenge is probing the magnetic and electronic information of a single atom column. According to theory this would be possible using ultra high resolution. This new probing technique will be of extreme importance for e.g. spintronics. Modern (nano) technology more and more requires information in 3 dimensions (3D), rather than in 2D. This is possible through electron tomography; this technique will be optimised in order to obtain sub nanometer precision. A final challenge is the study of the interface between soft matter (bio- or organic materials) and hard matter. This was hitherto impossible because of the radiation damage of the electron beam. With the possibility to lower the voltage to 80 kV and possibly 50 kV, maintaining more or less the resolution, we will hopefully be able to probe the active sites for catalysis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,160</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COXINEL"><Rcn>111480</Rcn><Nid>9040</Nid><HI>Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169; Civile Synchrotron Soleil, France</HI><Name>COherent Xray source INferred from Electrons accelerated by Laser</Name><PI>Marie-Emmanuelle Couprie</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Since the first laser discovery in 1960 and the first Free Electron Laser (FEL) in 1977, Linac based fourth generation light sources provide intense coherent fs pulses in the X-ray range for multidisciplinary investigations of matter. In parallel, Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA) by using intense laser beams interacting with cm long plasmas can now provide high quality electron beams of very short bunches (few fs) with high peak currents (few kA). The so-called 5th generation light source aims at reducing the size and the cost of these FELs by replacing the linac by LWFA. Indeed, spontaneous emission from LWFA has already been observed, but the presently still rather large energy spread (1 %) and divergence (mrad) prevent from the FEL amplification. In 2012, two novel schemes in the transport proposed in the community, including my SOLEIL group, predict a laser gain increase by 3 or 4 orders of magnitudes. COXINEL aims at demonstrating the first lasing of an LWFA FEL and its detailed study in close interaction with future potential users. The key concept relies on an innovative electron beam longitudinal and transverse manipulation in the transport towards an undulator: a ""demixing"" chicane sorts the electrons in energy and reduces the spread from 1 % to a slice one of 0.1%, and the transverse density is maintained constant all along the undulator (supermatching). Simulations based on the performance of the 60 TW laser of the Laboratoire d&#226;&#128;&#153;Optique Appliqu&#195;&#169;e and existing undulators from SOLEIL suggest that the conditions for lasing are fulfilled. The SOLEIL environment also possesses the engineering fabrication capability for the actual realization of these theoretical ideas, with original undulators and innovative variable permanent compact magnets for the transport.

With the ERC grant, the PI plans to hire post-doc fellows and PhD students, to offer 1-to-3 months positions to confirmed  researchers, a regular seminar and workshops.

A lot is known on  finite dimensional control systems and  linear control systems modeled by partial differential equations. Much less is known for nonlinear control systems modeled by partial differential equations. In particular, in many important cases,  one does not know how to use the classical iterated Lie brackets which are so useful to deal with nonlinear control systems in finite dimension.

In this project, the PI plans to develop, with the research group, methods to deal with the problems of controllability and of stabilization for nonlinear systems modeled by partial differential equations, in the case where the nonlinearity plays a crucial role. This is for example the case where the linearized control system around the equilibrium of interest is not controllable or not stabilizable. This is also the case when the nonlinearity is too big at infinity and one looks for global results. This is also the case if the nonlinearity contains too many derivatives. The PI has already introduced some methods to deal with these cases, but a lot remains to be done. Indeed, many natural important and challenging problems are still open.

Co-adaptation is the
parallel phenomenon in which users both adapt their behavior to the system&#226;&#128;&#153;s constraints, learning its power and idiosyncrasies, and
appropriate the system for their own needs, often using it in ways unintended by the system designer.
A key insight in designing for co-adaptation is that we can encapsulate interactions and treat them as first class objects, called interaction
instruments This lets us focus on the specific characteristics of how human users express their intentions, both learning from and
controlling the system. By making instruments co-adaptive, we can radically change how people use interactive systems, providing
incrementally learnable paths that offer users greater expressive power and mastery of their technology.
The project offers theoretical, technical and empirical contributions. CREATIV will develop a novel architecture and generative principles for
creating co-adaptive instruments. The multi-disciplinary design team includes computer scientists, social scientists and designers as well
as &#226;&#128;&#152;extreme users&#226;&#128;&#153;, creative professionals who push the limits of their technology. Using participatory design techniques, we will articulate

studies, in the lab and in the field, to test hypotheses and assess the success of the prototypes.

Each topic is chosen such that it not only provides a testing ground for more general ideas, but it also is grounded in specific examples which can help guide the general principles. Each topic has the potential to make dramatic advances, both on the subject of cryptography itself and how it is used and deployed in the real world.

We will be investigating application domains as diverse as cloud computing, electronic voting, protocols for trusted computing and privacy preserving methodologies. Each topic will be tackled however with common tools of provable security, and testing via implementation. In addition we aim to extend the tool box of techniques available to the cryptographer in terms of analysis and development methodologies, by being guided by the above application domains.

This research will have a transformative affect on the subject of cryptography and how it is deployed in the real world. We aim to demonstrate that previous &#226;&#128;&#156;blue-skies&#226;&#128;&#157; research can have direct practical benefit in applications, by researching in a pipeline of theory-to-practice.

My group at Bristol is not only the best place to execute this ambitious programme of work, but, due to the unique combination of theoretical and practical perspectives we offer, possibly the only place capable of working on these interrelated fronts."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,102,041</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CRITMAG"><Rcn>94181</Rcn><Nid>13036</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Critical Behaviour in Magmatic Systems</Name><PI>Jonathan David Blundy</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Crustal magmatism is periodic on a very wide range of timescales from pulses of continental crustal growth, through formation of granite batholiths, to eruptions from individual volcanic centres. The cause of this periodicity is not understood. I aim to address this long-standing geological problem through a combination of experiments, petrological methods and numerical models via a novel proposal that periodicity arises because of the highly non-linear ( critical ) behaviour of magma crystallinity with temperature in a series of linked crustal magma reservoirs. The ultimate objective is to answer five fundamental questions: " Why is crustal magmatism episodic? " How are large batholiths formed of rather similar magmas over long periods of time? " How do large bodies of eruptible magma develop that can lead to huge, caldera-forming eruptions? " What controls the chemistry of crustal magmas? Why are some compositions over-represented relative to others? " What is the thermal structure beneath volcanic arcs and how does it evolve with time? The project will address these questions through case studies of three contrasted active volcanoes: Nevado de Toluca, Mexico; Soufriere St Vincent, Lesser Antilles; and Mount Pinatubo, Philippines. For each volcano I will use experimental petrology to constrain the phase relations of the most recently erupted magma as a function of pressure, temperature, volatile content and oxygen fugacity in the shallow, sub-volcanic storage region. I will also carry out high-pressure phase equilibria on coeval Mg-rich basaltic rocks from each area with the aim of constraining the lower crustal conditions under which the shallow magmas were generated and use diffusion chronometry to constrain the frequency of magmatic pulses in the sub-volcanic reservoirs. The project will result in a quantum leap forwards in how experimental and observational petrology can be used to understand magmatic behaviour beneath hazardous volcanoes</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,959,518</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CROWDED-PRO-LIPIDS"><Rcn>103342</Rcn><Nid>9936</Nid><HI>Tty-Saatio, Finland</HI><Name>Computational Perspective to Dynamical Protein-Lipid Complexes under Crowded Conditions</Name><PI>Ilpo Tapio Vattulainen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"One of the great challenges is to understand how cellular functions emerge in cell membrane systems. Unlocking this mystery is the key to the vast majority of human diseases. The current view is based on a static picture where membrane proteins in protein-poor membranes interact with a few specific lipids, while in reality the situation is much more complicated. This ambitious project aims for a breakthrough by changing the present paradigm. The objective is to focus on the dynamical interplay between lipids and proteins under crowded conditions, paving the way for understanding the dynamics of lipid-protein complexes and their resulting functions. The objectives are outstanding and contain a high risk, with exceptional gain. The main goal is better understanding of the physical principles that give rise to cellular functions, with a strong impact to clarify the relevance of dynamical lipid-protein interactions in cellular processes related to health and disease. For this purpose, the grand themes chosen for this project are lipoproteins coupled to cardiovascular disease (&#226;&#128;&#156;good&#226;&#128;&#157; and &#226;&#128;&#156;bad&#226;&#128;&#157; cholesterol) and the function of especially cholesterol and glycolipids with membrane proteins. In order to meet these goals, the applicant employs state-of-the-art simulation techniques that comprise quantum-mechanical, classical atomistic and coarse-grained simulation methods to elucidate the complex biological phenomena associated with lipid-protein systems. The simulations cover atomistic and molecular details, over time scales from femtoseconds up to milliseconds.

Structure, dynamics, development, differentiation and even apoptosis of cells are guided by physical stimuli feeding into a regulatory network integrating biochemical and mechanical signals. Cells are equipped with both, force-generating structures, and stress sensors including force-sensitive structural proteins or mechanosensitive ion channels. Pathways from force sensing to structural and transcriptional controls are not yet understood.

The goal of the proposed interdisciplinary project is to quantitatively establish such pathways, connecting the statistical physics and the mechanics to the biochemistry. We will measure and model the complex non-equilibrium mechanical structures in cells, and we will study how external and cell-generated forces activate sensory processes that (i) act (back) on the morphology of the cell structures, and (ii) lead to cell-fate decisions, such as differentiation. The most prominent stress-bearing and -generating structures in cells are actin/myosin based, and the most prominent mechanoactive and -sensitive cell types are fibroblasts in connective tissue and myocytes in muscle. We will first focus on actin/myosin bundles in fibroblasts and in sarcomeres in developing heart muscle cells. We will observe cells under the influence of exactly controlled external stresses. Forces on suspended single cells or cell clusters will be exerted by laser trapping and sensitively detected by laser interferometry. We furthermore will monitor mechanically triggered transcriptional regulation by detecting mRNA in the nucleus of mouse stem cells differentiating to cardiomyocytes. We will develop fluorescent mRNA sensors that can be imaged in cells, based on near-IR fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes.

One of the two leading hypotheses is founded on magnetically sensitive photochemical reactions in the retina. It is thought that transient photo-induced radical pairs in cryptochrome, a blue-light photoreceptor protein, act as the primary magnetic sensor. Experimental and theoretical support for this mechanism has been accumulating over the last few years, qualifying chemical magnetoreception for a place in the emerging field of Quantum Biology.

In this proposal, we aim to determine the detailed principles of efficient chemical sensing of weak magnetic fields, to elucidate the biophysics of animal compass magnetoreception, and to explore the possibilities of magnetic sensing technologies inspired by the coherent dynamics of entangled electron spins in cryptochrome-based radical pairs.

We will:
(a)  Establish the fundamental structural, kinetic, dynamic and magnetic properties that allow efficient chemical sensing of Earth-strength magnetic fields in cryptochromes.
(b)  Devise new, sensitive forms of optical spectroscopy for this purpose.
(c)  Design, construct and iteratively refine non-natural proteins (maquettes) as versatile model systems for testing and optimising molecular magnetoreceptors.
(d)  Characterise the spin dynamics and magnetic sensitivity of maquette magnetoreceptors using specialised magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopic techniques.
(e)  Develop efficient and accurate methods for simulating the coherent spin dynamics of realistic radical pairs in order to interpret experimental data, guide the implementation of new experiments, test concepts of magnetoreceptor function, and guide the design of efficient sensors.

A system is described as cooperative when it behaves differently from expectations based on the properties of its individual components. Multivalent cooperativity is crucial for biological molecular recognition, yet the factors determining the magnitude of this effect are poorly understood. Excitonic cooperativity is exploited in sensitive detectors for explosives, and is the basis of photosynthetic light harvesting. Electronic cooperativity is illustrated on the molecular scale by the phenomenon of aromaticity, and on a larger scale by metallic conductivity. Magnetic properties provide many examples of cooperativity. The magnitude of cooperative effects increases with the strength of coupling between the individual components, and with the number of coupled components. Cooperative systems exhibit sharp changes in behavior in response to small changes in conditions, such as transitions from free to bound, fluorescent to non-fluorescent, or conductive to insulating. The tendency towards an &#226;&#128;&#156;all-or-nothing&#226;&#128;&#157; response is often useful; in the limit of a very large ensemble, it leads to phase transitions. The CoSuN project will extend methodology developed in Oxford to create large monodisperse supramolecular nanostructures which are uniquely suited for exploring multivalent, excitonic and electronic cooperativity. The template-directed synthesis of these nanostructures is made possible by strong multivalent cooperativity, while the electronic coupling between the individual subunits results in other cooperative phenomena. This project will clarify understanding of cooperative molecular recognition. It will also help to solve some of the mysteries of photosynthesis and reveal the first molecular manifestations of coherent quantum mechanical phenomena, such as Aharonov-Bohm effects.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,452,688</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ComplexiTE"><Rcn>108479</Rcn><Nid>12899</Nid><HI>Universidade Do Minho, Portugal</HI><Name>An integrated multidisciplinary tissue engineering approach combining novel high-throughput screening and advanced methodologies to create complex biomaterials-stem cells constructs</Name><PI>Rui Luis Gon&#195;&#167;alves Dos Reis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>New developments on tissue engineering strategies should realize the complexity of tissue remodelling and the inter-dependency of many variables associated to stem cells and biomaterials interactions.

Several ground-breaking advances are expected to be achieved, including: i) improved methodologies for isolation and expansion of sub-populations of stem cells derived from not so explored sources such as adipose tissue and amniotic fluid; ii) radically new methods to monitor human stem cells behaviour in vivo; iii) new macromolecules isolated from renewable resources, especially from marine origin; iv) combinations of liquid volumes mingling biomaterials and distinct stem cells, generating hydrogel beads upon adequate cross-linking reactions; v) optimised culture of the produced beads in adequate 3D bioreactors and a novel selection method to sort the beads that show a (pre-defined) positive biological reading; vi) random 3D arrays validated by identifying the natural polymers and cells composing the positive beads; v) 2D arrays of selected hydrogel spots for brand new in vivo tests, in which each spot of the implanted chip may be evaluated within the living animal using adequate imaging methods; vi) new porous scaffolds of the best combinations formed by particles agglomeration or fiber-based rapid-prototyping.

fluids (MWFs). For most mechanical machining processes such as turning, milling, drilling, and grinding the use of MWFs is indispensable
as they perform several essential functions in material removal processes, such as cooling of workpiece and tool, reduction of heat
generation by lubrication, removal of chips and promotion of chemical reactions with the surface.
In the past decades the scientific understanding of MWF effectiveness could not keep up with the rapid developments in the industrial
application of MWFs. As a consequence of this lack of knowledge, today&#226;&#128;&#153;s MWFs consist of up to 60 chemical components with partly
harmful properties and thus hazardous potential for the operator and the environment.
Hence, this project will aim towards scientific based innovations and suggests a four-mission approach for stimulating a paradigm shift in
MWF features and application. Research will include: a) fundamental research on physical, chemical, and microbial working mechanisms,
which allows MWF components e.g., with controlled chemical activity, b) new MWF design e.g., the development of MWFs which consist of
lubricating bacteria replacing today&#226;&#128;&#153;s paradigms such as the usage of additives and oil in water emulsions, c) simplified MWF maintenance
and supply by e.g., in-process self-controlled chemical MWF composition and adaptation of the MWF supply system for temperature and
force reduction, and d) verification and transfer of the innovative, alternative systems e.g., on a test bench in a realistic environment being
part of a demonstration center. The distinguishing feature of the approach will be its cross-disciplinary and comprehensive nature.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,274,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Cosmic-Lab"><Rcn>98858</Rcn><Nid>9688</Nid><HI>Alma Mater Studiorum - Universita Di Bologna, Italy</HI><Name>Star clusters as cosmic laboratories for Astrophysics, Dynamics and Fundamental Physics</Name><PI>Francesco Ferraro</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) are the most populous, old and dense stellar systems in the Galaxy.

The first goal requires the study of the action of outer automorphisms of finite groups of Lie type on their irreducible characters and the solution of extension problems. The determination of the irreducible characters of all almost simple groups is a fundamental task of group theory.
For the second goal, we will build on the recent reductions (by the PI and others) of both conjectures to assertions on characters of finite simple groups. To prove these assertions, one needs to construct certain equivariant bijections with respect to outer automorphisms, which will involve the results from the first goal.
Furthermore, we propose to extend the reduction of the McKay conjecture to include several refinements, in particular the block-wise version and
congruences of character degrees.

Thanks to the renormalization group approach the critical behaviour of pure systems is under very good control; however disordered systems are in many ways remarkably peculiar (think for example to non-perturbative phenomena like Griffiths singularities), often the conventional approach does not work and many crucial issues are still unclear. My work aims to fill this important hole in our understanding of disordered systems. I will concentrate my efforts on some of the most important and studied systems, i.e. spin glasses, random field ferromagnets (that are realized in nature as diluted antiferromagnets in a field), Anderson and Mott localization (with possible experimental applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and to electron glasses), surface growth in random media (KPZ and DLA models). In this project I want to pursue a new approach to these problems. I aim to compute in the most accurate way the properties of these systems using the original Wilson formulation of the renormalization group with a phase space cell analysis; this is equivalent to solving a statistical model on a hierarchical lattice (Dyson-Bleher-Sinai model). This is not an easy job. In the same conceptual frame we plan to use simultaneously very different techniques: probabilistic techniques, perturbative techniques at high orders, expansions around mean field on Bethe lattice and numerical techniques to evaluate the critical behaviour. I believe that even this restricted approach is very ambitious, but that the theoretical progresses that have been done in unveiling important features of disordered systems suggest that it will be possible to obtain solid results.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,098,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CryptoCloud"><Rcn>185411</Rcn><Nid>11970</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Cryptography for the Cloud</Name><PI>David Daniel Rene Pointcheval</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Many companies have already started the migration to the Cloud and many individuals share their personal informations on social networks. Unfortunately, in the current access mode, the provider first authenticates the client, and grants him access, or not, according to his rights in the access-control list. Therefore, the provider itself not only has total access to the data, but also knows which data are accessed, by whom, and how: privacy, which includes secrecy of data (confidentiality), identities (anonymity), and requests (obliviousness), should be enforced.

The industry of the Cloud introduces a new implicit trust requirement: nobody has any idea at all of where and how his data are stored and manipulated, but everybody should blindly trust the providers. Privacy-compliant procedures cannot be left to the responsibility of the provider: however strong the trustfulness of the provider may be, any system or human vulnerability can be exploited against privacy. This presents too huge a threat to tolerate. The distribution of the data and the secrecy of the actions must be given back to the users. It requires promoting privacy as a global security notion.

A new generation of secure multi-party computation protocols is required to protect everybody in an appropriate way, with privacy and efficiency: interactive protocols will be the core approach to provide privacy in practical systems.

Privacy for the Cloud will have a huge societal impact since it will revolutionize the trust model: users will be able to make safe use of outsourced storage, namely for personal, financial and medical data, without having to worry about failures or attacks of the server. It will also have a strong economic impact, conferring a competitive advantage on Cloud providers implementing these tools.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,168,261</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="D-TXM"><Rcn>105002</Rcn><Nid>10963</Nid><HI>Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Diffraction Based Transmission X-ray Microscopy</Name><PI>Henning Friis Poulsen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The aim of this project is to develop a diffraction based transmission X-ray microscope, d-TXM, for non-destructive structural characterization of polycrystalline materials such as metals, ceramics, semiconductors, dust, soil and rocks, and for R&amp;D applications in e.g. the energy-, electronics- and environmental sectors. Uniquely, d-TXM will be able to visualise the grains inside 100 micrometer thick specimens with a spatial resolution of 10-30 nm. Up to a thousand grains may be mapped simultaneously in three dimensions with respect to morphology, phase, orientation and local stress-state. Furthermore, the method will be sufficiently fast to enable the acquisition of 3D movies of the time evolution of the structure in nano-materials and components during synthesis, processing or operation.
During the last decade the applicant pioneered and matured a set of X-ray based methods for 3D studies of polycrystals on the micrometre scale. For this achievement, he is recognized as a worldwide leading figure in X-ray instrumentation for structural materials, situated at a nodal point between materials, X-ray physics, applied mathematics and crystallography. The underlying vision of d-TXM is similar to this past work, but in terms of optics the microscopy approach is radically different and the spatial resolution will be two orders of magnitude better.
In this project, the scientific potential will be demonstrated by means of applications to selected issues in metallurgy. Being able to directly observe the evolution of the individual crystalline elements, our understanding of processes such as plasticity and phase evolution can be greatly enhanced.
Dissemination to other fields will take place via an advisory board of future users and a workshop.

Instead of working on improving  the architecture of the  next generation multicore, with the DAL project, we deliberately anticipate the  next few generations of  multicores.

While multicores featuring 1000's of cores might become  feasible around 2020, there are strong indications that sequential programming style will continue to be dominant. Even future mainstream parallel applications will exhibit large sequential sections.  Amdahl's law  indicates that high performance on these sequential sections is needed to enable overall high performance on the whole application. On many (most) applications, the effective performance of future computer systems using a  1000-core processor chip  will significantly depend on their performance on both sequential code sections and single thread.

We envision that,  around 2020, the processor chips will feature a few complex cores  and many (may be 1000's) simpler, more silicon and power effective cores.

In the DAL  research project, we will explore the microarchitecture techniques that will be needed to enable high performance on such heterogeneous processor chips. Very high performance will be required on both sequential sections -legacy sequential codes, sequential sections of parallel applications- and critical threads on parallel applications -e.g. the main thread controlling the application.

The techniques to be used are; Non-linear optical techniques, mainly Polarization spectroscopy, PS. PS will mainly be developed for sensitive detection with high spatial resolution of "new" species in the IR region, e.g. individual hydrocarbons, toxic species as well as alkali metal compounds. Multiplex measurements of these species and temperature will be developed as well as 2D visualization. Quantitative measurements with high precision and accuracy; Laser induced fluorescence and Rayleigh/Raman scattering will be developed for quantitative measurements of species concentration and 2D temperatures. Also a new technique will be developed for single ended experiments based on picosecond LIDAR. Advanced imaging techniques; New high speed (10-100 kHz) visualization techniques as well as 3D and even 4D visualization will be developed. In order to properly visualize dense sprays we will develop Ballistic Imaging as well as a new technique based on structured illumination of the area of interest for suppression of multiple scattering which normally cause blurring effects. All techniques developed above will be used for key studies of phenomena related to various combustion phenomena; turbulent combustion, multiphase conversion processes, e.g. spray combustion and gasification/pyrolysis of solid bio fuels. The techniques will also be applied for development and physical understanding of how combustion could be influenced by plasma/electrical assistance. Finally, the techniques will be prepared for applications in industrial combustion apparatus, e.g. furnaces, gasturbines and IC engines"</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,466,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DAMREG"><Rcn>108099</Rcn><Nid>11602</Nid><HI>Universite De Rennes I, France</HI><Name>Pushing the Frontier of Brittlness Damage Resistant Glasses</Name><PI>Tanguy Gilles Michel Rouxel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"In order to improve the strength of a glass part (flat display, window, lens, fiber, etc.), most investigations so far were devoted to thermal and chemical surface treatments aimed at generating compressive stresses at the surface. The DAMREG project focuses on the incidence of the glass composition and atomic network structure on the mechanical properties, and specifically on the cracking and fracture behavior, and is based on the experience and expertise of the PI on the structure-property relationships in glass science. This project proposes to address the fundamental issue of glass brittleness in a new paradigm of thinking, questioning the usefulness of the standard fracture toughness parameter, with emphasis on the surface flaw generation process (multiscale approach), and aims at determining novel routes to improve the mechanical performance of glass further promoting innovative applications. DAMREG involves revisiting the fundamental fracture mechanics concepts, the preparation of novel glass compositions, and nanoscale physico-chemical and mechanical characterization. So far most glass fracture studies focused on the crack tip behavior, and were limited to vitreous silica. A crack acts as a lever arm for the stress so that the singular stress at the tip is proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the square-root of the tip radius (provided this has a meaning). Since a crack can hardly be cured or shielded at ambient, the presence of a sharp crack is already detrimental. On the contrary to this approach, DAMREG is aimed at understanding the crack initiation process, and the main objective is to define some roadmap to design glasses (composition, thermo-mechanical treatments etc.) with better damage (initiation) resistance."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,821,596</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DARCLIFE"><Rcn>93885</Rcn><Nid>9965</Nid><HI>Universitaet Bremen, Germany</HI><Name>Deep subsurface Archaea: carbon cycle, life strategies, and role in sedimentary ecosystems</Name><PI>Kai-Uwe Hinrichs</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Archaea are increasingly recognized as globally abundant organisms that mediate important processes controlling greenhouse gases and nutrients. Our latest work, published in PNAS and Nature, suggests that Archaea dominate the biomass in the subseafloor. Their unique ability to cope with extreme energy starvation appears to be a selecting factor. Marine sediments are of crucial importance to the redox balance and climate of our planet but the regulating role of the deep biosphere remains one of the great puzzles in biogeochemistry. The unique and diverse sedimentary Archaea with no cultured representatives, so-called benthic archaea, are key to understanding this system. Their presumed ability to degrade complex recalcitrant organic residues highlights their relevance for the carbon cycle and as potential targets for biotechnology. I propose to study the role of benthic archaea in the carbon cycle and in the deep biosphere and to explore their life strategies. This task requires an interdisciplinary frontier research approach at the scale of an ERC grant, involving biogeochemistry, earth sciences, and microbiology. Central to my research strategy is the information contained in structural and isotopic properties of membrane lipids from benthic archaea, an area of research spearheaded by my lab. In-depth geochemical examination of their habitat will elucidate processes they mediate. Metagenomic analysis will provide a phylogenetic framework and further insights on metabolism. At the Archaeenzentrum in Regensburg, we will grow model Archaea under a set of environmental conditions and examine the impact on cellular lipid distributions in order to develop the full potential of lipids as proxies for studying nearly inaccessible microbial life. Attempts to enrich benthic archaea from sediments will complement this approach. This frontier research will constrain the role of benthic archaea in the Earth system and examine the fundamental properties of life at minimum energy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,908,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DARE"><Rcn>88846</Rcn><Nid>11662</Nid><HI>National Technical University Of Athens - Ntua, Greece</HI><Name>Soil Foundation Structure Systems Beyond Conventional Seismic Failure Thresholds: Application to New or Existing Structures and Monuments</Name><PI>George Gazetas</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The main goal of the proposed research is to investigate the possibility of allowing  below-ground  support systems to respond to strong seismic shaking by going beyond a number of  thresholds  that would conventionally imply failure and are today forbidden by codes.

Whereas under static loading conditions a slight  exceedance  of such thresholds leads to failure, the oscillatory nature of seismic shaking will  allow  such exceedances for a short period of time, with perhaps no detrimental or irreparable consequences.  The latter take the form of permanent foundation displacements, rotations, or  injuries , which the designer will aspire to confine within rational limits. The motivation and the need for this research has come from : (i) observations of actual behaviour in a variety of earthquakes ; conspicuous examples : the permanent tilting , overturning, and often survival of numerous buildings on extremely soft soil in Adapazari during the Kocaeli 1999 earthquake ; (ii) the foundation design of a number of critical structures (e.g., major bridge pier, air control tower, tall monuments, elevated water tanks,) against large seismic actions ; the disproportionately large overturning moment and/or base shear force of such slender structures can hardly be faced with today s conventional foundation methods, (iii) the need to seismically retrofit and rehabilitate older structures and historical monuments;  (iv) structural yielding of pile foundations is now detectable (thanks to technological advances), thus eliminating one of the reasons for avoiding it.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,399,992</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DARK"><Rcn>99207</Rcn><Nid>8770</Nid><HI>Universite Pierre Et Marie Curie - Paris 6, France</HI><Name>Dark Matters</Name><PI>Joseph Ivor Silk</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This interdisciplinary proposal spans theoretical astrophysics and particle physics by addressing  the need to provide astrophysical expertise to the particle astrophysics community in the area of dark matter and dark energy research.

Theoretical predictions will be refined to pursue the quest for dark matter using novel experiments designed to detect the direct signatures of dark matter in our galactic halo via  scattering and indirect via annihilations into high energy particles and photons.  Dark matter and dark energy will be studied by cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations and structure formation constraints.

Reconstructing the large-scale distribution of galaxies in space and time, they provide us with a unique probe of the basic constituents of the Universe, their evolution and the background fundamental physics. A new generation of even larger surveys is planned for the starting decade, with the aim of solving the remaining mysteries of the standard model using high-precision measurements of galaxy clustering. These entail the nature of the &#226;&#128;&#156;dark sector&#226;&#128;&#157; and in particular the origin of the accelerated cosmic expansion. While data accumulation already started, the needed analysis capabilities to reach the required percent levels in both accuracy and precision are not ready yet.

I propose to establish a focused research group to develop these tools and optimally analyze the new data, while being directly involved in their collection. New techniques as redshift-space distortions and well-known but still debated probes as galaxy clusters will be refined to a new level. They will be combined with more standard methods as baryonic acoustic oscillations and external data as CMB anisotropies. Performances will be validated on mock samples from large numerical simulations and then applied to state-of-the-art data with enhanced control over systematic errors to obtain the best achievable measurements.

These new capabilities will be decisive in enabling ongoing and future surveys to tackle the key open problems in cosmology: What is the nature of dark energy? Is it produced by an evolving scalar field? Or does it rather require a modification of the laws of gravity? How does it relate to dark matter? What is the role of neutrinos?  The answer to these questions may well revolutionize our view of physics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,723,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DARWIN"><Rcn>88844</Rcn><Nid>13106</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Deep mm-Wave RF-CMOS Integrated Circuits</Name><PI>Michel Steyaert</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Wireless and mobile communication systems have become an important part of our daily environment. Since the introduction of the GSM-network in the early nineties, different wireless applications such as WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc. have been brought into the market. This has become possible due to the high integration of integrated circuits in relatively cheap technologies. Besides the digital signal processing, those wireless applications require complex analog circuits operating at very high frequencies (RF circuits). In the early days these were implemented as discrete components or standalone ICs in expensive technologies such as GaAs, InP and SiGe. Due to the research towards nanometer CMOS technologies, and due to improved RF circuit techniques, RF-CMOS has been introduced since the mid nineties. The intention of this research project is to take the next big leap forward in wireless applications, i.e. the exploration and research, based on the vast RF-CMOS knowledge already existing, towards the Extremely High Frequencies which is above 70 GHz up to 300GHz, with wavelengths close to 1 mm. The research project is a logical evolution of the RF-CMOS research knowledges of the team. For that the "natural evolution" acronym DARWIN (Deep mm-Wave RF CMOS Integrated Circuits (with the M of CMOS inverted (W)) is choosen. Implementing circuit techniques in standard CMOS technologies at those frequencies is again an enormous challenge and will open a lot of new opportunities and applications towards the future due to possibilities in safety monitoring, e.g. collision radar detection for automobiles at 77 GHz, the need for high data-rate telecommunication systems, with capacity of 1-10 Gbps, and imaging for medical and security systems. The goal of the proposed project is to perform the necessary fundamental basic research to be able to implement these 70-300 GHz applications in CMOS technology (45 nm and below).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,042,640</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DCENSY"><Rcn>94221</Rcn><Nid>12580</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Doping, Charge Transfer and Energy Flow in Hybrid Nanoparticle Systems</Name><PI>Uri Banin</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We target a frontier in nanocrystal science of combining disparate materials into a single hybrid nanosystem.

My goals are to create new highly controlled hybrid nanoparticle systems, focusing on combinations of semiconductors and metals, and to decipher the fundamental principles governing doping in nanoparticles and charge and energy transfer processes among components of the hybrid systems. The research addresses several key challenges: First, in synthesis, combining disparate material components into one hybrid nanoparticle system. Second, in self assembly, organizing a combination of semiconductor (SC) and metal nanoparticle building blocks into hybrid systems with controlled architecture. Third in fundamental physico-chemical questions pertaining to the unique attributes of the hybrid systems, constituting a key component of the research. A first aspect concerns doping of SC nanoparticles with metal atoms. A second aspect concerns light-induced charge transfer between the SC part and metal parts of the hybrid constructs.

At a practical level, quantum information thrives to build large quantum systems for tasks in communication or computing beyond the reach of classical devices. At the fundamental level, the question is whether there exists, in addition to environment-induced decoherence, another mechanism responsible for the disappearance of state superpositions at the macroscopic scale. Harmonic oscillators coupled to qubits are ideal to probe the limits of the quantum domain. Among various versions of this system, microwave Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics coupling Rydberg atoms to superconducting cavities has developed tools of un-matched sensitivity and precision. Building on these advances and on the development of deterministic atomic sources, DECLIC proposes to explore the dynamics of fields trapped in cavities and to study their decoherence under various perspectives. It will implement novel ways to generate non-classical states with large photon numbers stored in one cavity or non-locally split between two. DECLIC will record the gradual evolution of these states towards classicality and locality. Along this way, it will explore promising processes such as quantum random walks and collective photonic effects leading to non-classical interferometry breaking the standard quantum limit. Beyond witnessing decoherence, DECLIC will investigate ways to manipulate and control it, either by implementing feedback procedures steering the field towards targeted states, or by engineering artificial environments protecting against decoherence specific states of light. These experiments will provide invaluable clues for the understanding of other oscillator-qubit systems exploring the quantum to classical boundary."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DECODA"><Rcn>108267</Rcn><Nid>12708</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Tensor Decomposition for Data Analysis with Applications to Health and Environment</Name><PI>Pierre Comon</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Multi-Way factor Analysis (MWA) is attracting growing interest in many disciplines of engineering, as described in this proposal. Because the applications are much more numerous than those that serve as focus for this project, the tools developed in the framework of the project will have major impact. MWA is probably the simplest extension of the well-known (linear) Factor Analysis. However, despite its extremely wide panel of applications and its apparently simple expression, it still, surprisingly, lacks theoretical background. The reason is that this identification problem disguises challenges of unexpected magnitude. In fact, several tensor problems still remain open for several decades, and the difficulties should not be overlooked. Yet, the lack of identifiability results (existence, uniqueness) prevents the design of efficient numerical algorithms.
The first objective is to address these theoretical problems and develop appropriate identification algorithms. Multilinear models underlying MWA are shown to be closely related to tensor algebra and multivariate polynomials, so that tools can be borrowed from Algebraic Geometry, with the goal of developing theoretical solutions and numerical algorithms. The second objective is to apply these solutions to practical problems in various realms of application. In particular, it centers on creating modified models, better matched to analysis of health (e.g., EEG) or environmental data (e.g., water resources, microbial ecosystems), to analyzing their identifiability, and to developing corresponding identification algorithms. The final goal is to design a device able to detect and track suspect or toxic molecules in river or tap waters.

The key to this knowledge is the ability to interpret studies of seismic wave velocities through the deep Earth using laboratory measurements of mineral sound velocities at high pressures and temperatures. Scientists have for many years measured these properties as a function of pressure but due to the experimental difficulties the majority of studies have been performed only at room temperature. Large extrapolations of these data to mantle temperatures are required to link seismic velocity observations with physical and chemical properties of mantle rocks, resulting in large uncertainties that obscure firm conclusions.  An additional uncertainty arises because there is currently no primary scale for accurately measuring pressure at high temperatures. In this study mineral sound velocities and densities will be measured in the diamond anvil cell at simultaneous high pressures and high temperatures to at least 50 GPa and 1300K. This will be possible by a pioneering combination of Brillouin scattering spectroscopy, to measure sound velocities, and single crystal X-ray diffraction determinations of density. By making both types of measurements on the same sample while it is maintained at a constant pressure and temperature, the pressure can be independently measured. These absolute pressure determinations will be used to derive a new universal pressure scale for use at high temperatures. Sound velocities of the major mantle minerals will be determined at high temperatures and absolute pressures thereby drastically decreasing the uncertainties in velocity calculations for rock assemblages at deep mantle conditions. The resulting data will be employed to finally interpret a host of seismic observations made at both global and local scales.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,079,888</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DELPHI"><Rcn>93054</Rcn><Nid>12771</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Deterministic Logical Photon-Photon Interactions</Name><PI>Philippe Grangier</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The main objective of this proposal is to design and implement a novel scheme for efficient, deterministic, lossless photon-photon interactions, and to exploit it to achieve logical processing and quantum measurements on optical light beams.

These discrete events are the result of ion exchanges across membranes, electrochemical mechanisms, and active ion pumping through energy expenditure. The ensemble of spike trains discharged in the various parts of the neuromuscular system constitutes the neural code for movements. Recording and interpretation of this code provides the means for decoding the motor system. The main limitation in the investigation of the motor system is the current impossibility of detecting and processing in the intact human, during natural movements, the activity of a sufficiently large number of motor neurons and sensory afferents (neural code) to associate a functional meaning to the cellular mechanisms that ultimately determine a movement. This limitation in turn impedes to answer to many fundamental questions on the control of human movements. These questions have tremendous implications in the development of man-machine interface systems. In this project, we propose the development of advanced electrode systems for in-vivo electrophysiological recordings from nerves and muscles in humans and new computational methods/models for extracting functionally significant information on human movement from these recordings. The highly innovative focus is that of providing the link between the cellular mechanisms and the behavior of the whole motor system in the intact human, i.e. to build the bridge between the neural and functional understanding of movement. On the basis of these new technologies, we aim at answering open questions in movement neuroscience and using novel principles for man-machine interaction.

Specific examples of such classes are: the class of rings or the class of
algebraically closed fields.

It turns out that counting the so-called complete types over models in the
class has an important role in the development of model theory in general and
stability theory in particular.
Stable classes are those with relatively few complete types (over structures
from the class); understanding stable classes has been central in model theory
and its applications.

Recently, I have proved a new dichotomy among the unstable classes:
Instead of counting all the complete types, they are counted up to conjugacy.
Classes which have few types up to conjugacy are proved to be so-called
``dependent'' classes (which have also been called NIP classes).
I  have developed (under reasonable restrictions) a ``recounting theorem'',
parallel to the basic theorems of stability theory.

I have started to develop some of the basic properties of this new approach.
The goal of the current project is to develop systematically the theory of
dependent classes. The above mentioned results give strong indication that this
new theory can be eventually as useful as the (by now the classical) stability
theory. In particular, it covers many well known classes which stability theory
cannot treat.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,748,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIADEM"><Rcn>93430</Rcn><Nid>11536</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Domain-centric Intelligent Automated Data Extraction Methodology</Name><PI>Georg Gottlob</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal is in the area of automated web data extraction and web data management.

I envision that, based on these new foundations, we will be able to build extremely powerful systems that autonomously explore websites of a given domain, understand their structure and extract and output richly structured data in formats such as XML or RDF. We aim at systems that take as input a URL of a website in a given domain, automatically explore this site and deliver as output a structured data set containing all the relevant information present on that site.

One is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of extremal metrics on complex algebraic manifolds. These metrics are characterised by conditions on their curvature tensor a paradigm being the Riemannian version of the Einstein equation of General Relativity The standard conjecture is that the right condition should be the stability of the manifold, a condition defined entirely in the language of algebraic geometry. But there are very few cases where this conjecture has been verified. The problem comes down to proving the existence of a solution to highly nonlinear partial differential equation. The aim is to advance this theory by a detailed study of interesting but more amenable cases, for example where there is a large symmetry group. The second problem is to develop new invariants and structures associated to a particular class of manifolds of dimension 6 and 7 (with holonomy SU(3) and G2). These would be derived from the solutions of versions of the Yang-Mills equation over the manifolds, in a similar manner to familiar theories in 3 and 4 dimensions. In higher dimensions there are fundamental new difficulties to overcome to set up a theory rigorously and the main point of this part of the proposal is to attack these. It is likely that the new structures, if they do exist, will have interesting connections to other developments in this general area, involving string theory and algebraic geometry.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,501,361</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIOLS"><Rcn>110936</Rcn><Nid>8810</Nid><HI>Stichting Nioz, Koninklijk Nederlands Instituut Voor Onderzoek Der Zee, Netherlands</HI><Name>Long chain diols as novel organic proxies for paleoclimate reconstructions</Name><PI>Stefan Schouten</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Accurate reconstructions of past climate changes are essential to understand e.g. the sensitivity of Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s climate to global increases in atmospheric greenhouse gasses such as CO2. For these reconstructions it is vital to have proxies which are well constrained and are able to provide robust quantitative estimates. However, it has become clear that currently used proxies are sometimes associated with large uncertainties and thus more proxies are needed in order to perform reliable paleoclimate reconstructions.

In my group we are developing new proxies based on so-called long chain diols. These compounds are synthesized by several groups of algae and occur abundantly in present day oceans as well as ancient sediments. Initial results have shown that one set of compounds, the 1,14-diols, can be used to reconstruct past primary productivity and upwelling conditions. Excitingly, the distribution of another set of compounds, the long chain 1,13- and 1,15-diols, show a strong relationship with sea surface temperature and can be used to reconstruct past sea surface temperatures in several parts of the oceans. Finally, culture experiments indicate that the stable carbon isotopic composition of diatoms producing 1,14-diols is strongly related to CO2 concentrations, raising the possibility that it may be used to reconstruct ancient pCO2 levels.

In this ERC proposal I want to develop, test and apply these exciting new proxies in order to provide robust and accurate reconstructions of past oceans. To this end this ERC project is subdivided in several different subprojects, each designed to investigate long chain diol proxies but from a different perspective, in particular cultivation and molecular biology, organic geochemistry, (paleo)limnology and paleoceanography. The combination of these subprojects will result in a highly multidisciplinary project needed to make progress in the development of these unique proxies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,982</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIOPHANTINE PROBLEMS"><Rcn>97854</Rcn><Nid>13044</Nid><HI>Scuola Normale Superiore, Italy</HI><Name>Integral and Algebraic Points on Varieties, Diophantine Problems on Number Fields and Function Fields</Name><PI>Umberto Zannier</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Diophantine problems have always been a central topic in Number Theory, and have shown deep links with other basic mathematical topics, like Algebraic and Complex Geometry.

We plan a further study of integral points on varieties, and applications to Algebraic Dynamics, a possibility which has emerged recently.
We plan to study further the so-called `Unlikely intersections'. This theme contains celebrated issues like the Manin-Mumford conjecture. After work of the PI with Bombieri and Masser in the last 10 years, it has been the object of much recent work and also of new conjectures by R. Pink and B. Zilber.

Abstract: Research in discrete and convex geometry, using tools from combinatorics, algebraic

computer science, integer programming, and operations research. Algorithmic aspects are
emphasized and often serve as motivation or simply dictate the questions. The proposed

incidence problems, including algorithmic complexity of Tverberg's theorem, weak
epsilon-nets, the k-set problem, and algebraic approaches to the Erdos unit distance problem.
(2) Topological methods and questions, in particular topological Tverberg-type theorems,
algorithmic complexity of the existence of equivariant maps, mass partition problems, and the
generalized HeX lemma for the k-coloured d-dimensional grid. (3) Lattice polytopes and random
polytopes, including Arnold's question on the number of convex lattice polytopes, limit

Perhaps most promising is the study of limits of growing graph and hypergraph sequences.

The most celebrated effect of disorder is Anderson localization of single particles, but many other more complex phenomena arise in interacting, many-body systems. A full understanding of how disorder affects the behavior of quantum systems is still missing, also because of the unavoidable presence of nonlinearities, dissipation and thermal effects that make a careful exploration of real condensed-matter systems very difficult. In this project we want to fully exploit the unprecedented potentialities offered by ultracold atomic quantum gases to explore some of the present challenges for our understanding of the physics of disorder. These systems offer indeed the possibility of controlling to a great extent crucial parameters such as the type of disorder, the nonlinearities due to interactions, the temperature and density, the dimensionality, the quantum statistics. A variety of advanced diagnostic techniques allow to gain detailed information on the static and dynamic properties of the system. The potentialities of atomic quantum gases for the study of disorder have already showed up in recent breakthrough experiments. The project aims at an experimental exploration, supported by advanced theory, of the current issues in disordered quantum systems. We will investigate a few frontier themes of general interest: 1) Anderson localization and the interplay of disorder and a weak interaction; 2) strongly correlated, disordered bosonic systems; 3) disordered, interacting fermionic systems. In the research we will employ atomic Bose and Fermi gases with tunable interactions and advanced diagnostic techniques that we have recently contributed to develop.

Dirac materials are characterized by universal low energy properties due to presence of the nodal excitations.  It is this reduction of phase space due to additional symmetries that can be turned on and off that opens a new door to functionality of Dirac materials.

We propose to use the sensitivity of nodes in the electron spectrum of Dirac materials to induce controlled modifications of the Dirac points/lines via band structure engineering in artificial structures and via inelastic scattering processes with controlled doping.

Interlocked double-stranded (ds) DNA-architectures like catenanes or rotaxanes, wherein individual components can be set in motion in a controlled manner have not been accessible. These molecules represent long-sought devices for nanorobotics and nanomechanics because they possess a unique mechanical bonding motif, not available to conventional building blocks. The project will apply an unprecedented, simple, and modular interlocking paradigm for double-stranded (ds) circular DNA geometries that we have developed in preliminary studies. This will now be taken several crucial steps forward by generating unconventional DNA-, protein-, aptamer-, and ribozyme hybrid architectures containing interlocked structures wherein the motion of individual components can be controlled in many different ways. We will design, construct, and evaluate switchable autonomous DNA-nanomachines that function as rotational motors, muscles, or switches for powering and manipulating nanoscale components. The DNA machines envisaged in this project will be applied, for example, in synthetic supramolecular self-assembly systems that emulate complex biological machines like motor proteins, nucleic acid polymerases, or ATPases. In addition, they will be developed for multiple purposes in biosensing, logic-gate- and memory circuit assembly, and catalysis. This efficient method for constructing interlocked dsDNA nanostructures opens the exciting possibility of conjoining the area of lifesciences with that of nanomechanical engineering, paving entirely new avenues for nanotechnology.

Since around the turn of the millennium, the research area of organocatalysis has grown with a breathtaking speed and can now be seen as a third pillar of catalysis beside bio- and metal catalysis.

integrated in a common host language using polymorphic language

High fidelity formation of duplexes via non-covalent interactions between complementary sequences provides a straightforward approach to molecular programming of multicomponent self-assembly processes. The structure of the nucleic acid backbone and bases can be changed without destroying these properties, suggesting that there are all kinds of unexplored polymeric structures that will also show sequence selective duplex formation. This proposal investigates this rich new area at the interface of supramolecular, biological and polymer chemistry. The appeal of nucleic acids is that we can dial up any desired sequence via chemical solid phase synthesis or via biological template synthesis. With recent advances in polymerisation processes, which proceed under mild conditions compatible with non-covalent chemistry, we are now in a position to develop comparable processes for synthetic polymers. This proposal explores a ground-breaking approach to the synthesis of polymeric systems equipped with defined sequences of recognition sites. The aim is to establish protocols for routine solid phase synthesis of one class of oligomer, which can be used to template the synthesis of different classes of oligomer. This template chemistry will provide tools for polymerisation of conventional monomers using templates to determine the sequence of recognition sites and hence incorporate the selective recognition properties of nucleic acids into bulk polymers like polystyrene. The ability to program polymers with recognition information will open the way to new materials of unprecedented complexity and functionality with applications in all areas of nanotechnology where precise control over macromolecular structure and supramolecular organisation will be used to program mechanical, photochemical and electronic properties into sophisticated assemblies that rival biology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,457,947</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DUSTYGAL"><Rcn>106765</Rcn><Nid>12998</Nid><HI>University Of Durham, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The formation of massive galaxies: the roles of dust-obscured starbursts and AGN activity</Name><PI>Ian Robert Smail</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"I propose an integrated programme to determine the role of dust-obscured starburst activity and AGN growth in the formation and evolution of  galaxies.

We will design experimental tools to gain an atomistic understanding of the conformational transitions that give rise to allostery. We will approach the problem from two distinctively different directions. First, we will initiate conformational transitions of proteins that per se are not photoswitchable, by cross-linking two sites of an allosteric protein with a photo-switchable azobenzene-moiety to initiate a conformational transition similar to ligand binding. We will use ultrafast infrared spectroscopy to time-resolve the conformational transition. Second, we will experimentally verify a frequently expressed hypothesis that allosteric and active site communicate by exchange of vibrational energy. To that end, we will design a versatile approach that allows us to locally deposit vibrational energy at essentially any site in a protein (e.g. through pumping of an optical chromophore that undergoes ultrafast internal conversion), and to detect its appearance at any other site by using vibrational transitions as local thermometers. Thereby, we will map out a network of connectivity in a given protein. Both approaches will applied both to one and the same protein family. One concrete example are PDZ domains, which are among the smallest allosteric proteins, and for which the connection between allostery and vibrational energy flow has been made explicit, based on computer simulations. We will eventually test this hypothesis experimentally, and provide the foundation for a description of allostery that is on an equal footing as our current understanding of protein folding.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,400,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DYNamo"><Rcn>97650</Rcn><Nid>9664</Nid><HI>Universidad Del Pais Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Spain</HI><Name>Dynamical processes in open quantum systems: pushing the frontiers of theoretical spectroscopy</Name><PI>Angel Secades Rubio</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Scope ""Energy Materials.

We will provide answers to the following questions: What are the design principles from the environment-assisted quantum transport in photosynthetic organisms that can be transferred to nanostructured materials such as organic photovoltaic materials and biomimetic materials? What are the fundamental limits of excitonic transport properties such as exciton diffusion lengths and recombination rates? What is the role of quantum coherence in the energy transport in photosynthetic complexes and photovoltaic materials?  What is the role of spatial confinement in water and proton transfer through porous membranes (nano-capillarity)?
The ground-breaking nature of the project lies in being the first systematic development and application of the theories of open quantum systems   and quantum optimal control within an ab-initio framework (time-dependent-density functional theory).

The LHC at CERN will push the Energy frontier well into the TeV region and shed light on electroweak symmetry breaking. The LHCb experiment,  super-B factories and other dedicated experiments, also in the lepton sector, will push forward the Intensity frontier and test the Standard Model description of flavor and CP violation with unprecedented accuracy.  Earth- and space-based experiments will push forward the Astroparticle frontier, in particular direct and indirect searches for Dark Matter. My goal is to identify a coherent explanation of the three mysteries, as complete and as unique as possible, by combining the vast information coming from the Energy, Intensity and  Astroparticle frontiers. This requires a global strategy, making use of highly qualified competences in the relevant branches of theory and phenomenology. I will put together some of the leading particle theorists operating in SISSA, Padua and Rome into a unique and extraordinarily strong team. The variety of competences,  ranging from phenomenological fits and data interpretation to unified models and fundamental theories, will be used to interpret the results coming from a wide range of experiments and to formulate a coherent framework to account for them. With the essential contribution of the researchers paid on the project funds, the project will catalyze results going much beyond what the team members could individually achieve. The main support requested to the ERC is for hiring six experienced researchers, the rest of the funds are for optimizing the effectiveness of the team and the research environment.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,439,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DiluteParaWater"><Rcn>110296</Rcn><Nid>10231</Nid><HI>Ecole Normale Superieure, France</HI><Name>Long-Lived Nuclear Magnetization in Dilute Para-Water</Name><PI>Geoffrey Bodenhausen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The magnetization of hydrogen nuclei in H2O constitutes the basis of most applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI.) Only ortho-water, where the two proton spins are in states that are symmetric with respect to permutation, features NMR-allowed transitions. Para-water is analogous to para-hydrogen, where the two proton spins are anti-symmetric with respect to permutation. The objective of this proposal is to render para-H2O accessible to observation. Several strategies will be developed for its preparation and observation in solids, liquids and gas phase, with yields up to 33%. When diluted in acetonitrile at room temperature, we found that Tortho(H2O) = 6 s. Based on experiments on H2C groups where Tpara/Tortho &gt; 37, we conservatively estimate that Tpara/Tortho &gt; 10 for H2O, so that we expect Tpara = 60 s. Dilution in aprotic solvents inhibits the exchange of protons and extends the lifetimes t(H2O) of water molecules from ca. 1 ms in pure water to 10 s and beyond, so that proton exchange does not hamper the use para-water. The ratio Tpara/Tortho of H2O depends on temperature, viscosity, paramagnetic agents, etc., which affect intra- and inter-molecular dipole-dipole interactions, chemical shift anisotropy, and spin rotation. In cases where proton exchange significantly shortens the lifetime of para-H2O, we shall prepare and observe para-ethanol and aqueous solutions of para-glycine, which cannot suffer from proton exchange, and allow similar perspectives as para-water. In conventional MRI, contrast stems mostly from spatial variations of T1 and T2. By monitoring the ratio Tpara/Tortho as a function of spatial coordinates, it will be possible to obtain a novel type of contrast. In suitable phantoms and porous media, para-water will allow us to characterize slow transport phenomena such as flow, diffusion, and electrophoretic mobility. The study of transport phenomena will become possible over longer time intervals, lower velocities or greater distances.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Disorder Control"><Rcn>111342</Rcn><Nid>10100</Nid><HI>Rheinisch-Westfaelische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany</HI><Name>Tuning Disorder in Chalcogenides to realize Advanced Functional Devices</Name><PI>Matthias Wuttig</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Better performance of future computers and communication equipment requires substantially higher speeds of switching devices at lower energy consumption. Those requirements can only be achieved by substantial improvement of the transport properties of the materials employed. The transport of charge and heat is strongly influenced by disorder. In recent years we have found a unique class of crystalline materials which combines an exceptionally high, yet tuneable degree of disorder with remarkable transport properties. This class includes the best phase change materials, superconductors with an unconventional coupling mechanism, good thermoelectrics, as well as known topological insulators. For these different phenomena disorder is either very beneficial or &#226;&#128;&#147; if unconditioned - rather detrimental. Hence we need to be able to control disorder in these materials to tailor their properties.
Exploring this concept requires the ability to understand, eliminate or harness the effects of disorder. Recently we have demonstrated an Anderson-type transition from insulating to metallic behaviour upon annealing. However, to fully utilize these ideas it is mandatory to realize devices with a more directly controllable degree of disorder. Within the framework of this project, we will develop a tuneable Anderson insulator to delocalize charge carriers. This allows us to address a) the transition from an insulator to a metal, the impact of disorder on superconductors (b) and topological insulators (c) and finally d) the ability to control thermoelectric properties by tuneable electronic disorder. From the results to be obtained we expect consequences for a wide range of materials listed in our &#226;&#128;&#156;treasure map&#226;&#128;&#157;, with promising new technological applications in various devices.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,186,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DropletControl"><Rcn>106612</Rcn><Nid>11561</Nid><HI>Aarhus Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Controlling the orientation of molecules inside liquid helium nanodroplets</Name><PI>Henrik Stapelfeldt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>In this project I will develop and exploit experimental methods, based on short and intense laser pulses, to control the spatial orientation of molecules dissolved in liquid helium nanodroplets. This idea is, so far, completely unexplored but it has the potential to open a multitude of new opportunities in physics and chemistry. The main objectives are:

1) Complete control and real time monitoring of molecular rotation inside liquid helium droplets, exploring superfluidity of the droplets, the possible formation of quantum vortices, and rotational dephasing due to interaction of the dissolved molecules with the He solvent.

2) Ultrafast imaging of molecules undergoing chemical reaction dynamics inside liquid helium droplets, exploring rapid energy dissipation from reacting molecules to the helium solvent, transition between mirror forms of chiral molecules, strong laser field processes in He-solvated molecules, and structure determination of non crystalizable proteins by electron or x-ray diffraction.

I will achieve the objectives by combining liquid helium droplet technology, ultrafast laser pulse methods and advanced electron and ion imaging detection. The experiments will both rely on existing apparatus in my laboratories and on new vacuum and laser equipment to be set up during the project.

The ability to control how molecules are turned in space is of fundamental importance because interactions of molecules with other molecules, atoms or radiation depend on their spatial orientation. For isolated molecules in the gas phase laser based methods, developed over the past 12 years, now enable very refined and precise control over the spatial orientation of molecules. By contrast, orientational control of molecules in solution has not been demonstrated despite the potential of being able to do so is enormous, notably because most chemistry occurs in a solvent rather than in a gas of isolated molecules.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,409,773</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="E-SWARM"><Rcn>94377</Rcn><Nid>8753</Nid><HI>Universite Libre De Bruxelles, Belgium</HI><Name>Engineering Swarm Intelligence Systems</Name><PI>Marco Dorigo</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Swarm intelligence is the discipline that deals with natural and artificial systems composed of many individuals that coordinate using decentralized control and self-organization.

This is not sufficient for us to design swarm intelligence systems at the level of complexity required by many real-world applications, or to accurately predict the behavior of the systems we design. The goal of the E-SWARM is to develop a rigorous engineering methodology for the design and implementation of artificial swarm intelligence systems. We believe that in the future, swarm intelligence will be an important tool for researchers and engineers interested in solving certain classes of complex problems.

Ample observational evidence exists for anthropogenic climate change including measured increased in atmospheric CO2, temperature and sea level rise. Biomass burning causes CO2 emissions of ~50% of those from fossil-fuel combustion and so are highly likely to influence future climate change. However, aerosols continue to be the least understood aspect of the modern climate system and even less is known about their past influence. Anthropogenic aerosols may have altered the global climate system for thousands of years as suggested by comparing late-Holocene greenhouse-gas concentrations to those from previous interglacials. The decrease in the spatial extent of forests beginning ~8000 yrs BP may be related to early agricultural activity including forest clearance through burning which should leave a quantifiable signal in climate proxies.
We pioneered a ground-breaking technique for determining a specific molecular marker of biomass burning (levoglucosan) which can record past fire in ice cores and lake sediments. The research incorporates continuous ice and lake core climate records from seven continents with parallel histories of fire regime. These can provide essential insight into the interplay between climate and human activity, especially with the advent of agriculture. Key objectives include:
1) How does biomass burning change through time and space?
2) How do climate parameters respond to or correlate with changes in biomass burning?
3) Did fires increase ~8000  and/or  ~5000 years ago?
4) Can natural and anthropogenic fires be differentiated? If so, how do fires and associated climate change ascribed to human activity differ from natural biomass burning?</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,370,767</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EARTHGROWTH"><Rcn>98259</Rcn><Nid>9468</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The construction of Planet Earth</Name><PI>Bernard John Wood</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The first 150 M.yrs of Earth evolution were the most dramatic in the history of the planet, setting the scene for the development of plate tectonics, the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s magnetic field and the origin of life. By the end of this period Earth had separated into core, mantle, crust and atmosphere and the Moon had formed by, it is presumed, a giant impact near the end of accretion. The aim of this project is to quantify the processes by which, during Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s earliest evolution, the chemical elements were distributed into different geological reservoirs, to determine the timings and conditions under which this partitioning occurred and to determine how Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s interior reached its current composition and oxidation state. The principal method involves experiments at high temperatures (1400-3000K) and high pressures (0-25 GPa, equivalent to 0-700 km depth) in which the silicate materials of Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s mantle, crust and core are equilibrated with one another and with a gas phase under controlled conditions. Elements which constrain the major processes of growth and differentiation of the Earth are added to each experiment in trace concentrations similar to those found on Earth. After the experiment the products (typically 2-60 mgm) are sectioned and their chemical compositions determined by microanalysis.  By varying the experimental conditions the dependence of the geochemical behaviour of the different elements on physical conditions such as pressure, temperature and oxidation state will be determined. These measurements of chemical fractionations between different phases are complemented by experimentally-measured isotopic fractionations between the same phases. These will enable us to interpret the observed isotopic differences between Earth and primitive planetary material (as represented by chondritic meteorites) in terms of the processes which formed our planet."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,761</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ECC SCIENG"><Rcn>89298</Rcn><Nid>9603</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Error-correcting codes and their applications in Science and Engineering</Name><PI>Mohammad Amin Shokrollahi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Error correcting codes are combinatorial objects which have traditionally been used to enhance the transmission of data on unreliable media. They have experienced a phenomenal growth since their birth some fifty years ago. Today, everyday tasks such as listening to a CD, accessing the hard disk of an electronic device, talking on a wireless phone, or downloading files from the Internet are impossible without the use of error-correcting codes. Though traditional communication still occupies centerstage in the realm of applied coding theory, emerging applications are changing the rules of the game, and calling for a new type of coding theory capable of addressing future needs. These are not limited to physical applications, however. In fact, coding theory is an integral part of solutions offered by researchers outside traditional physical communication to solve fundamental problems of interest, such as the complexity of computation, reliable transfer of bulk data, cryptographic protocols, self correcting software, signal processing, or even computational biology.While research in the past fifty years has put traditional coding theory on firm theoretical grounds, emerging applications are in need of new tools and methods to design, analyze, and implement coding technologies capable of dealing with future needs. This is the main concern of the present proposal. To strike the right balance between length and impact we have identified five areas of research that span the full spectrum of coding theory ranging from fundamental theoretical aspects to practical applications. We set out to develop new theoretical and practical models for the design and analysis of codes, and explore new application areas hitherto untouched. A unique feature of this proposal is our choice of the tools, ranging from classical areas of algebra, combinatorics, and probability theory, to ideas and methods from theoretical computer science.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,959,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ECOF"><Rcn>106900</Rcn><Nid>9630</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Electroactive Donor-Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks</Name><PI>Thomas Bein</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The effective conversion of light into chemical or electrical energy is one of the major challenges of humanity during the 21st century. Organic bulk heterojunctions of polymers or aggregates of small molecules combining donor- and acceptor-functionality offer promising prospects for effective light-induced energy conversion. In order to efficiently utilize the solar energy, interpenetrating networks of donor- and acceptor components are often required. While impressive advances have been achieved in organic photovoltaics systems, so far a deterministic control of their nanoscale morphology has been elusive. It would be a major breakthrough to develop model systems with well-defined periodic, interpenetrating networks of electron donor- and acceptor-phases. It is the goal of this project to create such highly defined model systems, to enhance our understanding of the relationship between the electronic and structural parameters and the resulting light-induced charge carrier dynamics. To pursue this challenge, we base our strategy on the recently discovered conceptual paradigm of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). COFs are a class of highly porous, organic crystalline materials that are held together by covalent bonds between molecular building blocks. In a concerted team effort with organic chemists, we will create COFs with different &#207;&#128;-stacked heteroaromatic electron donor- and acceptor moieties, thus forming highly ordered interpenetrating networks for light-induced charge separation.

where molecular clouds form yet still resolve the star formation and feedback events down to sub-parsec scales.
By following the full galactic ecology, the life cycle of gas from the interstellar medium into stars and their radiative and kinematic output back into
the galaxy, we will develop a comprehensive theory of star formation. The link between the large-scale dynamics of the galaxy and the
small-scale star formation provides the ground-breaking nature of this proposal.
Star formation produces a wide range
of outcomes in nearby molecular clouds yet on large scales yields star formation rates that are strongly correlated to galactic-scale gas densities.
These observed  properties of star forming galaxies have inspired a plethora of theoretical ideas, but until now there has been
no means of testing these analytical theories.
We will use galactic-disc simulations to determine how  molecular clouds form through self-gravity, spiral shocks and/or
cloud-cloud collisions. We will use these self-consistent models of molecular clouds to follow the local gravitational collapse to
form individual stars and stellar clusters.
We will include ionisation, stellar winds and supernovae into the ISM to study how feedback can  support

We will also conduct Galactic bulge scale simulations to
model how gas flows into, and star formation occurs in, the Galactic centre.

The paleomagnetic data contain a broad spectrum of dipole moment fluctuations with polarity reversals and excursions that typically occur during periods of very low field intensity, but the amplitude and the timing of the variations as well as critical features remain debated. The variability of the dipole with rapid fluctuations combined with long-term changes must be clarified to understand what controls the dipole strength, why it fluctuates and what is the cause of polarity reversals. Much has been learned for the past 30 years from records of paleointensity relying on natural remanent magnetization of sediments and lava flows, but large uncertainties persist and major features of the field remain poorly documented, pointing out the limits of the approach. As an alternative to magnetization, changes in geomagnetic intensity can be reconstructed from the production of cosmogenic 10Be. The 10Be production can be measured with confidence from sedimentary sequences. Our main objective is to build up a worldwide database of the dipole field changes for the past 5 Ma by acquiring high resolution records of 10Be production from a worldwide set of selected sediment cores. The Accelerator mass spectrometry national facility &#194;&#171; ASTER&#194;&#187; at CEREGE dedicated to 10Be measurements offers this unique opportunity.  Accurate time control will be obtained by astronomical calibration of paleoenvironmental records. In parallel, we will focus on the short-term field changes occurring during geomagnetic reversals. This will be addressed by combining detailed paleomagnetic records of reversals from volcanic sequences with high resolution 10Be measurements from marine cores that recorded the same reversals.

While the Large Hadron Collider at CERN was built to explore the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking on tiny distance scales of an attometer, the absence of clear hints for new particles in existing high-energy physics experiments suggests that new phenomena might only occur at distances still smaller than this. What if the LHC discovers a Higgs boson and nothing else? It has recently been realized that significantly shorter distances of only a few zeptometer (10^-21 m) can be probed indirectly in precision measurements of rare weak decay processes and of the couplings of the Higgs boson. Exploring nature at these scales never before accessible to mankind requires breakthrough advances in theory.

I propose a broad theoretical approach to precision physics in and beyond the Standard Model based on effective field-theory tools. In the context of warped extra-dimension models, the genuine quantum structure of fundamental physics will be probed in loop-mediated processes, including Higgs-boson production and decay as well as rare flavour-changing neutral current processes. These explorations will be complemented by highest-precision calculations of important collider-physics processes, such as Higgs, top, and electroweak gauge-boson production in association with jets, which for the first time will be performed without recourse to phenomenological models. The multi-loop anomalous dimensions required for these calculations will also provide a deeper understanding of the structure of infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes in non-abelian gauge theories.

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been conceived to replace the conventional methods of computational fluid dynamics. Due to its computational efficiency and simplicity in handling complex geometries, LBM was only partly successful in simulating incompressible flows. However, it faced stiff challenges in other domains of fluid dynamics due to low isotropy of the lattice and lack of stability. Recently, a new generation of entropic lattice Boltzmann models (ELBM) restored second law of thermodynamics in the lattice Boltzmann kinetics and made lattice Boltzmann unconditionally stable. Armed with new higher-order entropic lattices, ELBM project will open up high Reynolds number flows, compressible flows, multi-phase and micro flows and other domains for fast and efficient simulations. New ELBM models retain all the advantages of LBM in terms of efficiency, parallelism, and handling of complex geometries. This project will serve as unique source of largest possible benchmark simulations and engineering applications in fluid dynamics; thus challenging or even replacing the most advanced methods of computational fluid dynamics as well as particle methods in micro flows."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,656,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ELYCHE"><Rcn>90227</Rcn><Nid>9082</Nid><HI>Politecnico Di Milano, Italy</HI><Name>Electron-scale dynamics in chemistry</Name><PI>Mauro Nisoli</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The target of the proposal is the first experimental demonstration of attosecond coherent control of electron motion in many-particle systems. The past decade has seen remarkable advances in the field of coherent control of chemical reactions thanks to the application of femtosecond technology; I propose to use the emerging attosecond technology to achieve coherent control of photodissociation reactions on a purely electronic scale. I will mainly concentrate on molecules with biological interest. The success of the project will be based on the possibility to initiate and control the sub-femtosecond electronic motion in large molecules, by using high-intensity isolated attosecond pulses. Such electron motion precedes and determines the subsequent nuclear rearrangement, which ultimately leads to the chemical change. In this way it will be possible to control in a direct way the outcome of a chemical reaction, which is one of the central problems in modern chemistry. A crucial benchmark of the project, substantially beyond the current state-of-the-art in Attosecond Science, will be the experimental demonstration of attosecond pump / attosecond-probe measurements, which for the present are not technically feasible. Electron dynamics will be measured, with attosecond resolution, in many-particle systems, ranging from simple molecules to complex bio-molecules.
The application of attosecond pulses and the development of attochemistry techniques for the investigation of the primary electronic steps of chemical processes, is a completely new and challenging research field, with tremendous prospects for both fundamental research and technology. In particular, the attosecond coherent control of charge localization in bio-molecules can offer unique information on the mechanisms at the basis of biological signal transmission or on the processes leading to damaging of complex biological molecules (from polypeptides to proteins and DNA).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,446,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EMERGRAV"><Rcn>98230</Rcn><Nid>9471</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>"Emergent Gravity, String Theory and the Holographic Principle"</Name><PI>Erik Peter Verlinde</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The study of black hole physics and string theory are leading to a novel perspective on gravity and space-time.

It states that the microscopic information associated with the physical world can be stored on the boundary of space. From this holographic viewpoint I have recently derived the familiar laws of Newton and Einstein using only first principles. Gravity appears as an entropic force caused by changes in information associated with matter. With this ERC proposal I am aiming to build a research group that will further develop this new entropic view on gravity. The powerful string theoretic tools, such as the holographic correspondence between gauge theory and gravity, will be used to illuminate and further clarify gravity&#226;&#128;&#153;s entropic origin.  In addition, I plan to investigate the implications of the emergence of the gravitational force for the areas in which gravity plays a crucial role, in particular cosmology. For instance, the entropic viewpoint is expected to shed new light on the nature of dark energy and possibly dark matter. It may also lead to a new perspective on the other fundamental forces, since the notions of inertia and mass need to be reconsidered as well. The understanding of gravity as an emergent phenomenon will also influence and benefit from the conceptual ideas developed in condensed matter physics, such as the recently discovered connection between quantum critical electron systems and black hole horizons.

What make it so powerful are the combination of thermal contrast between the World s largest landmass (Eurasian continent) and ocean basin (the Indo-Pacific Ocean) and the presence of the World s largest ridge, the Tibetan Plateau. Climatologically, monsoon regions are the most convectively active areas and account for the majority of global atmospheric heat and moisture transport.  Moreover, the economy, culture and rhythms of life of 60% of humanity are critically influenced by the evolution and variability of the Asian monsoon. The need to better understand the monsoon leads inevitably to the close inspection of its activity during the geological times to provide a long-term perspective from which any future change may be more effectively assessed. Our research proposal aims to understand the seeming paradox of the exceptionally intense East Asian summer monsoon (actually the strongest over the last one million years) which occurred during the relatively cool interglacial (MIS-13), 500,000 years ago. This will be done using first a model of intermediate complexity (LOVECLIM) to achieve a number of sensitivity experiments to the astronomical forcing, the Eurasian and North American ice sheets, the Tibetan Plateau and the Ocean. Ocean-atmosphere coupled general circulation models will then be used to confirm the main processes underlined by LOVECLIM, in particular those related to the wave train topographically induced by the Eurasian ice sheet, to the Tibetan Plateau, to the sea-surface temperature and to their role in reinforcing the East Asian summer monsoon. This monsoon of MIS-13 will be compared with the monsoon which occurred during the other interglacials of the upper Pleistocene and Holocene (about the last 700,000 years). All simulation results will be compared with the available proxy records, in particular-but not exclusively-those coming from the loess-soil sequences in China."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>893,880</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ENERGYSURF"><Rcn>99543</Rcn><Nid>12120</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Surfaces of Energy Functional Metal Oxides</Name><PI>Geoffrey Thornton</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Many important interactions near the surfaces of energy functional metal oxide surfaces are yet to be established at the atomic level. How bonds are formed and broken in photocatalysis, the role of the metal and oxide in a supported metal catalyst, the mechanism of energy flow from atom to atom after photoexcitation in a photovoltaic device are just some of the open questions. The underlying motivation to generate answers is clear: it provides an opportunity to improve technology associated with light harvesting and energy-related catalysis. But the fundamental science required is extremely challenging and is only just starting to yield some detailed answers. In this highly ambitious project we will tackle three major issues associated with the surface chemistry of energy functional metal oxides-- three grand challenges. In doing so, we will make use of a unique range of experimental techniques. One will focus on solid-gas interactions in studies of Au on CeO2, employing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and STM-inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy to answer questions about the active site of water gas shift catalysis and the mechanism by which the substrate reversibly exchanges oxygen.  The second challenge will probe the structures of interfaces between water and ZnO and TiO2, using surface X-ray diffraction and STM. This will include the adsorption of dye mimics from solution. In the third challenge, femtosecond time resolved photoemission using pump probe will be used to unravel the details of energy dissipation following a UV pulse absorption by ZnO and TiO2 substrates and their interaction with water. This is directly related to processes associated with photocatalysis. We expect that this ERC project will revolutionise our understanding of energy functional surfaces based on metal oxides and ultimately lead to key breakthroughs in the design of advanced devices.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,364,681</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EPCABO"><Rcn>106467</Rcn><Nid>10914</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Engineered Protein Capsids as Artificial Bacterial Organelles</Name><PI>Donald Michael Hilvert</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Many proteins self-assemble into regular, shell-like, polyhedral structures.

They can consequently serve as delivery vehicles, bioimaging agents, reaction vessels, and templates for the controlled synthesis of novel materials.  Here, we will apply our experience with protein design and laboratory evolution to extend the properties of protein containers to create practical, non-viral encapsulation systems for applications in the test tube and in living cells. Specifically, we will adapt the icosohedral cage structures formed by Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (AaLS) to engineer increasingly sophisticated supramolecular complexes for use as delivery vehicles, nanoreactors and, ultimately, as bacterial organelles. Our principal aims are to: (a) tailor AaLS capsids for selective encapsulation of a broad range of macromolecular guests; (b) develop AaLS capsids as delivery vehicles for medical and imaging applications; (c) design simplified, functional mimics of carbon-fixing carboxysomes; (d) evolve redox active organelles for metabolizing aliphatic alcohols; and (e) engineer artificial organelles for the detoxification of polychlorinated phenols.

This disorder is in fact due to the nature of the films, and is NOT an intrinsic molecular property. Indeed, single-crystal organic semiconductors are known, and display exciting characteristics and high performance. Unfortunately, they are today only grown as individual objects, not applicable to integrable thin-film transistors (TFT), solar cells (OPV), and light-emitting diodes (OLED) or transistors (OLET).
In this project, we propose a radical shift in the film formation of organic semiconductors, to master the nucleation and growth of highly crystalline thin films on arbitrary surfaces. We propose several possible templates for crystal growth, control of nucleation sites and new techniques to impose gradients in supersaturation of the environment from which the molecules condense in a growing crystal. Fundamental understanding of the thin-film crystal forming processes will be acquired by in-situ monitoring, and by modelling of nucleation and growth processes. We will apply similar methodologies to hetero-epitaxy of thin-film crystals, i.e. growth of crystalline layers of different types of molecules, and to doping of crystals.  This will open a gateway to use the immense libraries of organic semiconducting molecules for application in high-performance crystalline heterojunction devices.
Proof-of-principle devices will complement the materials science study and establish new research domains. We propose integrable crystalline TFTs, as these are also useful to further probe the physics of crystalline organic semiconductors. Crystalline heterojunction OPVs promise combined high exciton diffusion lengths and carrier mobilities. We will explore the benefits of crystallinity in heterojunction OLEDs and OLETs towards higher current densities and brightness, which may lead to the elusive electrically pumped organic laser."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,408</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EQU"><Rcn>104134</Rcn><Nid>12533</Nid><HI>K&#195;&#184;benhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Exploring the Quantum Universe</Name><PI>Jan Ambj&#195;&#184;rn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"One of the main unsolved problems in theoretical  physics today is to reconcile the theories of  general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Another harder problem is the study of the distribution of special points on Shimura varieties. In a different direction (linked with quantum chaos), the study of the concentration of Laplacian (Maass) eigenforms or of sections of holomorphic bundles is related to similar problems.  Given X such a space and G&gt;L the underlying algebraic group and its corresponding lattice L,  the above questions boil down to studying the distribution of H-orbits x.H (or more generally H-invariant measures)on the quotient L\G for some subgroups H. This question may be studied different methods:  Harmonic Analysis (HA): given a function f on  L\G one studies the period integral of f along x.H. This may be done by automorphic methods. In favorable circumstances, the above periods are related to L-functions which one may hope to treat by methods from analytic number theory (the subconvexity problem).  Ergodic Theory (ET): one studies the properties of weak*-limits of the measures supported by x.H using rigidity techniques: depending on the nature of H, one might use either rigidity of unipotent actions or the more recent rigidity  results for torus actions in rank &gt;1.  In fact, HA and ET are intertwined and complementary : the use of ET in this context require a substantial input from number theory and HA, while ET lead to a soft understanding of several features of HA. In addition, the Langlands correspondence principle make it possible to pass from one group G to another. Based on earlier experience, our goal is to develop these interactions systematically and to develop new approaches to outstanding arithmetic problems :eg. the subconvexity problem or the Andre/Oort conjecture."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>866,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ESSOG"><Rcn>108005</Rcn><Nid>9269</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Extracting science from surveys of our Galaxy</Name><PI>James Jeffrey Binney</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The goal is to put in place the infrastructure required to extract the promised science for large surveys of our Galaxy that are underway and will culminate in ESA's Cornerstone Mission Gaia.

During the last decades there has been an almost revolutionary development of modern X-ray based tools. We are today at a turning point in the development of synchrotron radiation based electron spectroscopy, where the program of the PI has maintained a leading position since 20 years. New techniques are evolving parallel to the development of a new generation of ultra-brilliant synchrotron radiation (SR) facilities. Electron spectroscopy is one of the most important techniques for the advancement of materials science and is one of the corner stones for the research at SR facilities. It is of highest priority to introduce new types of instruments to push the spectroscopy into new domains of time, spatial, energy and angular resolution.

We have recently accomplished a break-through in this field with a new type of electron analyzer, the ArTOF instrument, capable of increasing the energy resolution down to the micro-eV range with a simultaneous increase of the transmission of almost three orders of magnitude, compared to the earlier instruments. In addition the emission angles of all electrons are determined, with high precision and within a wide cone. This allows us to obtain three dimensional electronic structure information in real time. The present ERC proposal defines an ambitious program to fully exploit the new possibilities in urgent fields of research: In situ time resolved electronic band structure of organic crystals for electronic applications, time resolved studies of 3D band structure of solids and new 2D materials (graphene, topological insulators), electron structure and dynamics of materials for solar cell applications, and in other important research fields.

That understanding has transformed many aspects of our world. This success has now reached an important limitation. As the systems we seek to understand increase in dimension and complexity, oscillatory and complex order information becomes much more important, and on normal computational scales the systems of interest often fail to fit the smooth Newtonian paradigm.

Mathematical tools that go beyond that smooth paradigm, and particularly Ito's extension of calculus to systems that have an additional Brownian component, have proved enormously valuable and have helped raised Stochastic Mathematics to the centre of the subject in a period of little more than 60 years. It has provided some of the most important applications of mathematics (spanning Neuroscience, Finance, Engineering, Image processing) over the second half of the last century.

In the late 1990s a new tool, the theory of rough paths, began to emerge. The mathematical aspects have been developed strongly by probability theorists to describe couplings between systems that are completely outside the Ito framework, by analysts to understand the solutions to certain non-linear vector valued PDEs, by classical analysts interested in the non-linear Fourier transform, and by those desiring to go beyond Monte Carlo techniques by choosing carefully chosen and representative scenarios instead of random ones. Several excellent texts now exist.

Key to this progress has been the combination of new definitions with strong rigorous results that underpin the concepts. The flow is still very active, and new tools, particularly the signature of a path, and the expected signature have a strong mathematical basis (eg. Annals of Math, Jan 2010) and potential as tools in pure and applied mathematics.

Molten silicates are a major transport agent in the differentiation and interaction of lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. Further, the immediate consequences of volcanic eruptions on all scales - local, regional and global - are issues of direct practical relevance to mankind as they are measured in lives, infrastructure and the environment. Volcanism is the result of a complex interplay of physico-chemical processes operating at varying efficiencies during ascent, differentiation and eruption of magma. As a result, volcanic phenomena span a range from effusive to explosive. The largest explosive events are repeatedly responsible for global impact on the Earth System, yet it is precisely these events that, due to their explosive character, are relatively inaccessible for direct scientific investigation. A major opportunity in accessing such systems has been provided by recent technological advances permitting the experimental investigation of volcanism. Experimental volcanology operates directly under volcanic conditions of time, pressure, temperature, and state; a near-unique opportunity in the solid earth sciences. Based on experimental volcanology, this project aims to provide mechanistic models of magmatic/volcanic processes and their impact on the Earth System. Four priority areas are selected as those needing most urgent attention. These are: 1) Quantification of the rheology of magma/lava for parameterisation of stress-strain relationships in numerical simulations of eruptive events. 2) Mechanistic understanding explosive failure of magma for the interpretation of volcanic hazard monitoring. 3) Development of quantitative methods for inferring eruptive physics from the physico-chemical fossil records (thermal, magnetic, chemical) preserved in volcanic lavas. 4) Experimental characterisation of the physical, chemical and biological properties and impact of volcanic ash on the earth system."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,991,058</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXCATRO"><Rcn>106874</Rcn><Nid>9635</Nid><HI>Johannes Gutenberg Universitaet Mainz, Germany</HI><Name>In-situ experiments on the chemical composition of high altitude aerosols and clouds in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere</Name><PI>Stephan Hans Paul Borrmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Clouds and aerosols are the most important component of the global climate system, but the least understood. The general goal of EXCATRO is to enhance the understanding of TROPICAL clouds/aerosols at high altitudes, and in particular to quantify the ORGANIC and ANTHROPOGENIC contributions. This is of fundamental importance for the global climate and ozone chemistry since (1) the highest solar energy input occurs in the tropics, (2) the fastest (convective) transport of trace substances and pollutants from the ground towards the stratosphere takes place here, and (3) the highest tropical clouds largely control how much water vapor and aerosols enter the global stratosphere.

Most of the processes and effects of tropical high clouds/aerosols critically depend on the chemical composition of individual particles. As very few direct in-situ measurements are available, I propose with EXCATRO: (1) to devise state-of-the-art in-situ instrumentation for the study of cloud/aerosol particle chemical composition from the Russian high altitude aircraft M-55 ""Geophysica"", and (2) to perform research flights within the Indian Monsoon and other tropical regions. In-situ, online-remote-controlled aerosol particle mass spectrometers as well as specific particle collection devices will allow measurements inside tropical (cirrus) clouds and aerosols as high as 20 km so as to gain essential insight into the processes underlying their origin, the formation of the stratospheric aerosol and of precipitation. Major emphasis is placed on the ORGANIC content of the measured aerosol, its sources and anthropogenic fraction, in particular from ground releases in the Indian Monsoon region and Southeast Asia.

The in-situ data will provide key input for the numerical simulation of clouds, and satellite product verification.

Magnetism is essentially a phenomenon of angular momentum and the interpretation  of magnetic order is based on the concept of exchange interaction. So far, the understanding of the physics of magnetism, including its dynamics, has only been achieved for systems close to their thermodynamic equilibrium. Magnetism at the length and time scale of the exchange interaction, that is to say, at nanometer length and femtosecond time scales, is completely unknown. Yet, future magnetic data storage aims at Tbit densities switched at THz rates, exactly this regime.

Recent developments of a new generation of femtosecond X-ray and picosecond THz free electron lasers create the opportunity, now for the first time, to experimentally visualize the transfer of angular momentum under strongly nonequilibrium conditions and thereby provide a so far inaccessible view to the strongest and most fundamental force in magnetism, the exchange interaction.

The new physics takes advantage of unique polariton properties including very light mass, strong non-linearities, bosonic character and direct access to density, phase and quantum statistics. The major goals are:

1. Transform the field into the regime of non-classical polariton physics. Major steps forward will include the polariton blockade where one polariton prevents the passage of the next, and very fast 10-100 GHz single photon sources, opening the way to realisation of a variety of strongly correlated photon phenomena in a solid state system.
2. Achieve a quantum phase transition in a system with strong inter-particle interactions, with particular opportunities deriving from the non-equilibrium nature of the polariton system.
3. In the many particle regime, create non-dispersing polariton wave-packets, study collisions and create the first polariton circuits, capitalising on advantageous soliton and condensate properties.

As well as the polariton area, the project will impact on several broader fields: semiconductor physics in revealing new interaction phenomena on the nanoscale, quantum optics and information science in the realisation of very fast single photon sources and quantum circuit functions, and new high density collective phase physics towards exploitation as opto-electronic logic gates and circuits. Advances in technology will be crucial to enable the new directions. They will include fabrication of highly uniform cavities using innovation in crystal growth, the pioneering of a new type of polariton system, waveguide polaritons, and the use of open cavities to permit the application of very short wavelength periodic potentials.

The performance of all these devices is strongly affected by exciton diffusion, a process that is little studied or understood (particularly compared with charge transport) largely because of the lack of reliable measurement techniques.  The purpose of this proposal is to make a breakthrough in the measurement, understanding and control of exciton diffusion in organic semiconductors, and so create a new generation of materials and devices with enhanced performance due to control of exciton diffusion.  The key elements of the study are first to develop and validate advanced measurements of exciton diffusion.  This will open up the whole topic of exciton &#226;&#128;&#156;transport&#226;&#128;&#157; and provide the tools for us (and others) to explore the physics of exciton diffusion and how it is affected by a range of factors relating to the structure of the materials and how they are processed.  The following phase of work will use information about the main factors affecting exciton diffusion to develop strategies for controlling it.  A particular challenge is to increase exciton diffusion which will then lead to improved efficiency of organic solar cells.  We aim to address this both by applying the structure-property relations we develop and by developing directional exciton transfer, including quantum coherent energy transfer.  This is an unconventional approach to improving organic solar cells, which could not only improve their efficiency, but also greatly simplify their structure, leading to a breakthrough in their manufacturability. Control of exciton diffusion arising from the proposed research will also lead to strategies for increasing the efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes and lasers."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,100,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXPANDERS"><Rcn>88380</Rcn><Nid>11183</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Expander Graphs in Pure and Applied Mathematics</Name><PI>Alexander Lubotzky</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Expander graphs are finite graphs which play a fundamental role in many areas of computer science such as: communication networks, algorithms and more.

Over centuries humans used drawing and sculpture to convey shapes. These tools require significant expertise and time investment, especially if one aims to describe complex or dynamic shapes. With the advent of virtual environments one would expect digital modeling to replace these traditional tools. Unfortunately, conventional techniques in the area have failed, since even trained computer artists still create with traditional media and only use the computer to reproduce already designed content.
Could digital media be turned into a tool, even more expressive and simpler to use than a pen, to convey and refine both static and dynamic 3D shapes? This is the goal of this project. Achieving it will make shape design directly possible in virtual form, from early drafting to progressive refinement and finalization of an idea. To this end, models for shape and motion need to be totally rethought from a user-centered perspective . Specifically, we propose the new paradigm of responsive 3D shapes &#226;&#128;&#147; a novel representation separating morphology from isometric embedding &#226;&#128;&#147; to define high-level, dynamic 3D content that takes form, is refined, moves and deforms based on user intent, expressed through intuitive interaction gestures.
Scientifically, while the problem we address belongs to Computer Graphics, it calls for a new convergence with Geometry, Simulation and Human Computer Interaction. In terms of impact, the resulting &#226;&#128;&#156;expressive virtual pen&#226;&#128;&#157; for 3D content will not only serve the needs of artists, but also of scientists and engineers willing to refine their thoughts by interacting with prototypes of their objects of study, educators and media aiming at quickly conveying their ideas, as well as anyone willing to communicate a 3D shape This project thus opens up new horizons for science, technology and society."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,116</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ElecSpecIons"><Rcn>94261</Rcn><Nid>11617</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>Electronic spectra of cold, large interstellar ions</Name><PI>John Paul Maier</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The purpose of this project is to measure for the first time gas-phase spectra of large carbon containing cations, at low temperatures, which are of astrophysical importance.

This project is interdisciplinary, bridging the areas of chemistry, physics, and astrophysics. It encompasses state of the art techniques of chemical physics and aims at obtaining information to solve the long standing enigma in observational astronomy, the identification of some of the molecules causing absorption of starlight in diffuse interstellar clouds. The project uses ion trapping technology, whereby mass-selected species are held in a radio-frequency field and the vibrations and rotations are relaxed by collisions with cold helium to typical interstellar temperatures of 10-30 K. The electronic spectra of a number of cations, selected on the basis of their special properties including those of bare carbon chains, rings and fullerenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cations and their protonated forms will be measured using new detection schemes.

hydrogen, helium, dark matter and radiation.  The emergence of
structure from a stochastic background of fluctuations in the
period between 400.000 years and 1 billion years  is the main subject
of this proposal.  This era saw the  formation of the first autonomous sources
of radiation, stars and black holes.  This `renaissance' of light led to the heating,
reionization  and pollution  of the Intergalactic Medium  with metals.

We will unravel   how the hydrogen in Universe progressed from substantially neutral to highly ionized  by detailed comparison  of cosmological hydro-simulations of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) and galaxy formation    including continuum and resonant Lyman-alpha radiative  transfer with QSO absorption spectra and   LBG/&#194;&#160;Lyman-alpha emitter surveys and other data.
This will help us to make the most out the wealth  of information which will be provided  by  new observational missions  and surveys which have just begun (or are just about to begin) to report results (UKIDDS, VISTA, Planck, Herschel, COS@HST, LOFAR, ALMA). In this way we expect to make  decisive contributions  to the expected transformation of  our understanding of this exciting period in the history of the Universe.

Measurements of the matter power spectrum on scales
from 1Mpc to a Gpc from  Lyman-alpha forest, weak gravitational lensing,
and galaxy survey data contain  important information of the
nature of dark matter and the mass and number of species of
neutrinos.  Particularly exciting is the possibility to significantly push the
limit  on 'how cold' dark matter is. To robustly  answer  the question, whether the free-streaming of dark matter suggested to solve the dwarf-galaxy problem  of the cold dark matter   paradigm is consistent with  Lyman-alpha forest data, is another key goal of this proposal.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,975,121</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ExoMol"><Rcn>98590</Rcn><Nid>12117</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>ExoMol: molecular line lists for exoplanet atmospheres</Name><PI>Charles Jonathan Penrose Tennyson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The discovery of extrasolar planets was one of the major advances of the last two decades.

comprehensive solution to this problem by providing spectroscopic data on all the molecular transitions of importance in the atmospheres of exoplanets. This data will be widely applicable to other problems and will be used for studies on cool stars, brown dwarfs and circumstellar environments. ExoMol will also be used by scientists who study spectra
of hot molecules in a other situations such as combustions.

A mixture of first principles and empirically tuned quantum mechanical methods will be used to compute comprehensive and huge (up to 100 billion

Road traffic remains one of the major sources of particulate matter, and diesel emissions are by far the largest source of atmospheric nanoparticles in urban areas.  Semi-volatile organic compounds emitted largely in the condensed matter phase are a major component of diesel emissions, and as primary particles are advected from their road traffic source, the semi-volatile compounds vaporise and are oxidised, forming a greater mass of secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  However, the semi-volatile compounds are extremely poorly characterised as they are not resolved by traditional gas chromatographic methods, presenting an unresolved complex mixture (UCM).  For this reason, despite being a major precursor of SOA, such compounds are often poorly represented or completely omitted from atmospheric chemistry-transport models.  This proposal is concerned with applying new two dimensional gas chromatographic methods to characterisation of the UCM at a molecular level which will be followed by studies of the physico-chemical properties of representative components of the semi-volatile emissions.  The very abundant nucleation nanoparticle mode of diesel emissions is comprised almost entirely of semi-volatile organic material and hence these particles are progressively lost from the atmosphere by evaporation.  Until now, there has been insufficient knowledge of the properties of the semi-volatile components to model this behaviour reliably.  Such processes will be quantified through both controlled laboratory studies and carefully designed field measurements.  Numerical models on both a street canyon and a neighbourhood (5x5 km) scale will be developed to simulate the key processes, such that spatial patterns and size distributions will be predicted, and compared with independent measurements."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,394,959</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FAULT-ADAPTIVE"><Rcn>102381</Rcn><Nid>10384</Nid><HI>University Of Cyprus, Cyprus</HI><Name>Fault-Adaptive Monitoring and Control of Complex Distributed Dynamical Systems</Name><PI>Marios Polycarpou</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The emergence of networked embedded systems and sensor/actuator networks has facilitated the development of advanced monitoring and control applications, where a large amount of sensor data is collected and processed in real-time in order to activate the appropriate actuators and achieve the desired control objectives.

There is a need to develop a systematic framework to enhance the reliability, fault-tolerance and sustainability of complex distributed dynamical systems through the use of fault-adaptive monitoring and control methods. The work proposed here will contribute to the development of such a framework with emphasis on applications related to critical infrastructure systems (e.g., power, water, telecommunications and transportation systems). It will provide an innovative approach based on the use of networked intelligent agent systems, where the state of the infrastructure is monitored and controlled by a network of sensors and actuators with cooperating agents for fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control. A hierarchical fault diagnosis architecture will be developed, with neighbouring fault diagnosis agents cooperating at a local level, while transmitting their information, as needed, to a regional monitoring agent, responsible for integrating in real-time local information into a large-scale &#226;&#128;&#156;picture&#226;&#128;&#157; of the health of the infrastructure.

Our aim is to develop a system of conjectures based on the concepts of feasible incompleteness and pseudorandomness. Feasible incompleteness refers to conjectures about unprovability of statements concerning low complexity computations and about lengths of proofs of finite consistency statements. Essentially, they say that incompleteness in the finite domain behaves in a similar way as in the infinite. Several conjectures of this kind have been already stated. They have strong consequences concerning separation of complexity classes, but only a few special cases have been proved. We want to develop a unified system which will also include conjectures connecting feasible incompleteness with pseudorandomness. A major part of our work will concern proving special cases and relativized versions of these conjectures in order to provide evidence for their truth.

It is not only a methodology for developing numerical algorithms, but also a mathematical framework in which to explore their behavior. The finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) provides a new structure that produces a deeper understanding of the finite element method and its connections to the partial differential equation being approximated. The goal is to develop discretizations which are compatible with the geometric, topological, and algebraic structures which underlie well-posedness of the partial differential equation. The phrase FEEC was first used in a paper the PI wrote for Acta Numerica in 2006, together with his coworkers, D.N. Arnold and R.S. Falk. The general philosophy of FEEC has led to the design of new algorithms and software developments, also in areas beyond the direct application of the theory. The present project will be devoted to further development of the foundations of FEEC, and to direct or indirect use of FEEC in specific applications. The ambition is to set the scene for a nubmer of new research directions based on FEEC by giving ground-braking contributions to its foundation. The aim is also to use FEEC as a tool, or a guideline, to extend the foundation of numerical PDEs to a variety of problems for which this foundation does not exist.

more stars at high rates. Although the total energy budget for this
phenomenon is clear, the details by which the processes operate are
not. This proposal aims to further our understanding of how accreting
black holes generate and feed back energy into the surrounding gas,
how it is dissipated and establishes a heating / cooling balance and
how the black hole, galaxy and feedback co-evolve. The work will focus
on the broad iron line and X-ray reflection spectral and reverberation

Recently, the temporal scale of the order of tens of femtoseconds (femtoscale) became available and new physical phenomena associated with this time scale, such as laser-induced electron and magnetic phase transitions, were discovered. The theoretical background for understanding this new physics is still rather poor. This temporal scale, like the spatial nanoscale is intermediate between micro- and macroworld making the standard approaches developed in micro- and macrophysics not suitable anymore.  Essentially new theoretical ideas and methods are necessary for its description, especially in a combination with the spatial nanoscale. The aim of this project is to provide such a background via detailed studies of key problems, and open the way for new practical applications.

Based on a combination of analytical and computational theoretical approaches (most of them were suggested by us), we plan to study systematically time-dependent many-body phenomena at the femto/nano scale. We will develop a theory of nonequilibrium magnetic interactions and spin dynamics of nanosystems and apply it to molecular magnets and clusters at metal surfaces and at graphene.

We seek to substantially advance the understanding of the resulting shapes and instabilities. Our approach will focus on numerical methods, validated through theoretical and experimental analysis.
Mathematically fluid-structure interactions involve ambitious moving boundary problems, where structure and fluid flow feedback on one another in complex ways. Detailed analysis requires precise modeling of coupling between very strongly de&#194;&#172;forming elasto-plastic solids and fluid flow in intricately curved spaces and solving both iteratively many times. To address this computational challenge, significant innovations will be implemented, including the use of novel erosion laws, the insertion of spatial curvature and metric directly into the equations of motion of the fluid, and special methods to handle the singular behaviour at kinks and constrictions. Our fluid solvers will be new variants of Lattice Boltzmann Models (LBM) coupled to temperature and concentration fields. The accuracy of the methods will be quantitatively validated by experiments.
An unconventional hydrodynamic formulation for electronic currents will provide big advantages. We will develop LBM solvers for quantum and relativistic fluids and in particular create a Lattice Wigner model and couple it to the molecular dynamics of the support.
Our method will open new horizons for the design of continuously regenerating filters, for shape optimi&#194;&#172;zation of heat exchangers and catalysts and for the engineering of electronic devices.

It is still an open issue, whether and how this collapse leads to neutron star formation or black holes (possibly also occurring subsequently), forming as a function of progenitor mass supernova events (SNe), faint supernovae with fallback from the innermost ejected zones (faint SNe), or hypernovae/collapsars/gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in conjunction with rotation, magnetic fields and highly energetic explosions. The focus of the present proposal is this transition region in stellar progenitor mass and its nucleosynthesis contributions to galactic evolution, linking diverse research fields like nuclear physics far from stability, the equation of state of dense objects, 3D magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport, and computational methods. The outcome is of extreme importance in understanding the nucleosynthesis impact of the first stars, the chemical evolution of galaxies and the origin of all elements, including those processes with still highly uncertain origins/sites like the r-process, the nu/p-process or the p-process."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,929,075</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FLAMENANOMANUFACTURE"><Rcn>93910</Rcn><Nid>9093</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Flame Aerosol Reactors for Manufacturing of Surface-Functionalized Nanoscale Materials and Devices</Name><PI>Sotirios Pratsinis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Nanotechnology research has been directed mostly to the design and synthesis of (a) materials with passive nanostructures (e.g. coatings, nanoparticles of organics, metals and ceramics) and (b) active devices with nanostructured materials (e.g. transistors, amplifiers, sensors, actuators etc). Little is known, however, about how well the unique properties of nanostructured materials are reproduced during their large scale synthesis, and how such manufacturing can be designed and carried out. A key goal here is to fundamentally understand synthesis of surface-functionalized, nanostructured, multicomponent particles by flame aerosol reactors (a proven scalable technology for simple ceramic oxide nanopowders). That way technology for making such sophisticated materials would be developed systematically for their efficient manufacture so that active devices containing them can be made economically. Our focus is on understanding aerosol formation of layered solid or fractal-like nanostructures by developing quantitative process models and systematic comparison to experimental data. This understanding will be used to guide synthesis of challenging nanoparticle compositions and process scale-up with close attention to safe product handling and health effects. The ultimate goal of this research is to address the next frontier of this field, namely the assembling of high performance active devices made with such functionalized or layered nanoparticles. Here these devices include but not limited to (a) actuators containing layered single superparamagnetic nanoparticles and (b) ultraselective and highly sensitive sensors made with highly conductive but disperse nanoelectrode layers for detection of trace organic vapors in the human breath for early diagnosis of serious illnesses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FLAVOUR"><Rcn>98541</Rcn><Nid>12116</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Towards the Construction of the Fundamental Theory of Flavour</Name><PI>Andrzej Jerzy Buras</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Six quarks and six leptons of different kinds, referred to as flavours, form the modern periodic table of the fundamental building blocks of matter. The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes these elementary particles and the forces between them. A deeper understanding of the flavour structure of quarks and leptons, of their masses and couplings, is however still missing.
Decisive new experiments are about to start in particle physics (LHC, high-intensity flavour facilities). They will test existing theoretical concepts and inspire new ideas. This should allow us to make substantial steps forwards in the construction of the fundamental Theory of Flavour, which is the main goal of this project. Such a theory should allow us to address the following fundamental questions: what is the underlying dynamics differentiating quarks and leptons of different flavour? Is this dynamics related to a new symmetry? How can this new dynamics be tested at low and high energies? These questions are of utmost importance in the context of our search for a new, more fundamental, theory of elementary interactions. They are also key ingredients to understand the strucutre of our Universe. Reaching this goal requires substantial efforts in model building, precision calculations, and phenomenological studies. These different lines of research will be joined in a novel way by the collaboration of the principal investigator with four younger team members.

Despite the significant advances made, all of the current genomic sequencing technologies suffer from two important shortcomings. Firstly, sample preparation is time-consuming and expensive, and requiring a full day for sample preparation for next-generation sequencing experiments. Secondly, sequence information is delivered in short fragments, which are then assembled into a complete genome. Assembly is time-consuming and often results in a highly fragmented genomic sequence and the loss of important information on large-scale structural variation within the genome.

We recently developed a super-resolution DNA mapping technology, which allows us to uniquely study genetic-scale features in genomic length DNA molecules. Labelling the DNA with fluorescent molecules at specific sequences and using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy enabled us to produce a map of a genomic DNA sequence with unparalleled resolution, the so called FLUOROCODE. In this project we aim to extend our methodology to map longer DNA molecules and to include a multi-colour version of the FLUOROCODE that will allow us to read genomic DNA molecules like a barcode and probe DNA methylation status. The sample preparation, DNA labelling and deposition for imaging will be integrated to allow rapid mapping of DNA molecules. At the same time nanopores will be explored as a route to high-throughput DNA mapping.

FLUOROCODE will develop technology that aims to complement the information derived from current DNA sequencing platforms. The technology developed by FLUOROCODE will enable DNA mapping at unprecedented speed and for a fraction of the cost of a typical DNA sequencing project. We aniticipate that our method will find applications in the rapid identification of pathogens and in producing genomic scaffolds to improve genome sequence assembly."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,423,160</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FMCoBe"><Rcn>111536</Rcn><Nid>9033</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Fluid Mechanics in Collective Behaviour: Multiscale Modelling and Applications</Name><PI>Petros Koumoutsakos</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Fluid mechanics are fundamental to collective behaviour in nature and technology. Fluids pervade complex systems at every scale, ranging from fish schools and flocking birds to bacterial colonies and nanoparticles for drug delivery. Despite its importance, little is known about the role of fluid mechanics in such applications. Is  schooling the result of vortex dynamics synthesised by individual fish wakes or the result of behavioural traits? Is fish schooling energetically favourable? How does blood affect the collective transport of nanoparticles in cancer therapy?

We seek to answer these questions through computational methods that resolve the interaction of fluids with multiple, deforming bodies across scales. Our methods rely on the innovative coupling of multi-scale particles with multi-resolution algorithms and grids. Uncertainty quantification techniques will link computations with experimental data. Learning and optimisation algorithms will investigate the optimality of collective behaviour and its relevance to technological applications.
Novel, scalable software, engineered to facilitate its broad use, will be made available to the scientific and industrial community.
Our group has built strong foundations in computational methods, fluid mechanics, biophysics, nanotechnology and their interfaces and this project gives us the opportunity to reach new frontiers.

Our goal is to provide unprecedented information about vortex dynamics of fish schooling, one of the most intriguing patterns in nature. Increased insight will open new horizons for mechanical understanding of collective behaviour, suggest new experiments and contribute to the rational design of industrial applications ranging from robots to wind farms.

The new state is characterized by excitations (quasi-particles) that carry fractional charge, which are expected to obey fractional statistics.  While odd denominator fractional states are expected to have an abelian statistics, the newly discovered 5/2 even denominator fractional state is expected to have a non-abelian statistics.  Moreover, a large number of emerging proposals predict that the latter state can be employed for topological quantum computing ( Station Q  was founded by Microsoft Corp. in order to pursue this goal).  This proposal aims at studying the abelian and non-abelian fractional charges, and in particular to observe their peculiar statistics.  While charges are preferably determined by measuring quantum shot noise, their statistics must be determined via interference experiments,  where one particle goes around another.  The experiments are very demanding since the even denominator fractions turn to be very fragile and thus can be observed only in the purest possible two dimensional electron gas and at the lowest temperatures.  While until very recently such high quality samples were available only by a single grower (in the USA), we have the capability now to grow extremely pure samples with profound even denominator states.  As will be detailed in the proposal, we have all the necessary tools to study charge and statistics of these fascinating excitations, due to our experience in crystal growth, shot noise and interferometry measurements."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FRACTFRICT"><Rcn>96997</Rcn><Nid>12563</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Fracture and Friction: Rapid Dynamics of Material Failure</Name><PI>Jay Fineberg</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>FractFrict is a comprehensive study of the space-time dynamics that lead to the failure of both bulk materials and frictionally bound interfaces. In these systems, failure is precipitated by rapidly moving singular fields at the tips of propagating cracks or crack-like fronts that cause material damage at microscopic scales. These generate damage that is macroscopically reflected as characteristic large-scale, modes of material failure. Thus, the structure of the fields that microscopically drive failure is critically important for an overall understanding of how macroscopic failure occurs.
The innovative real-time measurements proposed here will provide fundamental understanding of the form of the singular fields, their modes of regularization  and their relation to the resultant macroscopic modes of failure. Encompassing different classes of bulk materials and material interfaces.
We aim to:
[1] To establish a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the near-tip singular fields, their regularization modes and how they couple to the macroscopic dynamics in both frictional motion and fracture.
[2] To determine the types of singular failure processes in different classes of materials and interfaces (e.g. the brittle to ductile transition in amorphous materials, the role of fast fracture processes in frictional motion).
[3] To establish local (microscopic) laws of friction/failure and how they evolve into their macroscopic counterparts
[4]. To identify the existence and origins of crack instabilities in bulk and interface failure

We do not promise to solve any PDE; however, in certain strongly nonlinear regimes, solutions to a conservative non-integrable PDE  exhibit integrable behaviour. The realization of this idea, supported by some preliminary analytical and numerical results, will consist of three main tasks:  1) classify normal forms of quasilinear Hamiltonian PDEs and their perturbations; 2) reduce the lists of asymptotic solutions to an abridged list of universal forms represented via Painlev&#195;&#169; transcendents, theta-functions, etc.;  3) establish matching rules between the universal asymptotic expansions. Differential-geometric methods based on the theory of Frobenius manifolds will be crucial in solving the classification problems; analytic and algebro-geometric techniques applied to the Hurwitz spaces of Riemann surfaces will be instrumental in the description of nonlinear oscillatory regimes; selected solutions to Painlev&#195;&#169; equations and their generalizations will be needed for the analytic description of transitions from regular to oscillatory behaviour.  The project is aiming at creation of an online library of the main qualitative types of behaviour of solutions to large classes of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs supplied with analytic expressions, numerical codes and visualization tools, as well as with tests of existence of a Hamiltonian structure, integrability or almost integrability. Such a library will both stimulate the research in the field and lead to a high visibility of the project.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>864,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FUBSSY"><Rcn>97653</Rcn><Nid>12266</Nid><HI>Universite De Geneve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Functional Biosupramolecular Systems: Photosystems and Sensors</Name><PI>Stefan Georg Jean-Petit-Matile</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The general objective of this proposal is to discover access to ordered, soft and smart matter for use in materials sciences (e.g. molecular optoelectronics, organic solar cells), biology, medicine and chemistry.

Specific aim 2 is to create sensing systems in lipid bilayers that operate by pattern recognition with polyion/counterion complexes, and to apply the lessons learned to several interconnected topics (diagnostics, fluorescent membrane/nitrate probes, cellular uptake, organocatalysis with anion-&#195;&#128; interactions).

To address these challenges, crossfertilization at the interface of synthetic, supramolecular, biological and materials chemistry will be essential.  To produce the broad horizons needed for crossfertilization, projects on different topics are run in parallel.

Our ambition is to develop a unifying operator-based framework for signal processing that would provide the ``sparse"" counterpart of the classical theory, which is currently missing. To that end, we shall specify and investigate sparse stochastic processes that are continuously-defined and ruled by differential equations, and construct corresponding wavelet-like sparsifying transforms. Our hope is to be able to rigorously connect non-quadratic regularization and sparsity-constrained optimization to well-defined continuous-domain statistical models. We also want to develop a novel Lie-group formalism for the design of steerable, signal-adapted wavelet transforms with improved invariance and sparsifying properties, both in 2-D and 3-D.

We shall use these tools to define new reversible image representations in terms of singular points (contours and keypoints) and to develop novel algorithms for 3-D biomedical image analysis.

Thin film ceramics are terra incognita for compositions in the miscibility gap. The field is exciting since both surface and in-depth decomposition can take place in the alloys. The methodology is based on combined growth experiments, characterization, and ab initio calculations to identify and describe systems with a large miscibility gap.

Besides the investigation of static spin states and spin interactions, we will manipulate spin states in a controlled manner down to the single atom limit by making use of the spin-transfer torque exerted by spin-currents from an atomically sharp SP-STM tip across a vacuum barrier.

In the case of magnetic insulators we will probe spin states and spin-dependent interactions based on local measurements of the quantum-mechanical exchange and correlation forces between a single-atom tip with a well-defined spin state and single atoms of the sample. Spin excitations at the level of individual atoms will be probed by a combination of SP-STM with inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy, while the combination of MExFM with measurements of the damping of the cantilever oscillation will be employed to reveal local spin excitations in electrically insulating materials. Finally, we will couple an MExFM-type force sensor to the spin state of an optically trapped ultracold quantum gas with the challenging goal to combine scanning probe and quantum optical methods for manipulating quantum states of matter.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,049,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FiRM"><Rcn>88807</Rcn><Nid>12420</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Mathematical Methods for Financial Risk Management</Name><PI>Halil Mete Soner</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Since the pioneering works of Black &amp; Scholes, Merton and Markowitch, sophisticated quantitative methods are being used to introduce more complex financial products each year. However, this exciting increase in the complexity forces the industry to engage in proper risk management practices. The recent financial crisis emanating from risky loan practices is a prime example of this acute need. This proposal focuses exactly on this general problem. We will develop mathematical techniques to measure and assess the financial risk of new instruments. In the theoretical direction, we will expand the scope of recent studies on risk measures of Artzner et-al., and the stochastic representation formulae proved by the principal investigator and his collaborators. The core research team consists of mathematicians and the finance faculty. The newly created state-of-the-art finance laboratory at the host institution will have direct access to financial data. Moreover, executive education that is performed in this unit enables the research group to have close contacts with high level executives of the financial industry. The theoretical side of the project focuses on nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE), backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) and dynamic risk measures. Already a deep connection between BSDEs and dynamic risk measures is developed by Peng, Delbaen and collaborators. Also, the principal investigator and his collaborators developed connections to PDEs. In this project, we further investigate these connections. Chief goals of this project are theoretical results and computational techniques in the general areas of BSDEs, fully nonlinear PDEs, and the development of risk management practices that are acceptable by the industry. The composition of the research team and our expertise in quantitative methods, well position us to effectively formulate and study theoretical problems with financial impact.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>880,560</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FloodChange"><Rcn>102538</Rcn><Nid>8888</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Deciphering River Flood Change</Name><PI>Guenter Bloeschl</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Many major and devastating floods have occurred around the world recently. Their number and magnitude seems to have increased but such changes are not clear. More surprisingly, the exact causes of changes remain a mystery. Although, drivers such as climate and land use change are known to play a critical role, their complex interactions in flood generation have not been disentangled.
The main objectives of this project are to understand how changes in land use and climate translate into changes in river floods, what are the factors controlling this relationship and what are the uncertainties involved. We decipher the relationship between changes in floods and their drivers by analysing the processes separately for different flood types such as flash floods, rain-on-snow floods and large scale synoptic floods. We then use data from catchments in transects across Europe to build a probabilistic flood-change model that explicitly describes the change mechanisms. The model is unconventional as it does not take a reductionist approach but conceptualises the dominant flood change processes at the catchment scale. We test the model on long high-quality flood data series. We use the model as well as the temporal and spatial data variability to quantify the sensitivity of floods to climate and land use change and estimate the uncertainties involved. The data are already available to me or will be made available through my excellent contacts in Europe.
For the first time, it will be possible to systematise the effects of land use and climate on floods which will provide a vital step towards predicting how floods will change in the future.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,263,565</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FunDMS"><Rcn>89067</Rcn><Nid>9665</Nid><HI>Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Poland</HI><Name>Functionalisation of Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors</Name><PI>Tomasz Dietl</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Low-temperature studies of transition metal doped III-V and II-VI compounds carried out over the last decade have demonstrated the unprecedented opportunity offered by these systems for exploring physical phenomena and device concepts in previously unavailable combinations of quantum structures and ferromagnetism in semiconductors.  The work proposed here aims at combining and at advancing epitaxial methods, spatially-resolved nano-characterisation tools, and theoretical modelling in order to understand the intricate interplay between carrier localisation, magnetism, and magnetic ion distribution in DMS, and to develop functional DMS structures. To accomplish these goals we will take advantage of two recent breakthroughs in materials engineering. First, the attainment of high-k oxides makes now possible to generate interfacial hole densities up to 10^21 cm-3. We will exploit gated thin layers of DMS phosphides, nitrides, and oxides, in which hole delocalization and thus high temperature ferromagnetism is to be expected under gate bias. Furthermore we will systematically investigate how the Curie temperature of (Ga,Mn)As can be risen above 180 K. Second, the progress in nanoscale chemical analysis has allowed demonstrating that high temperature ferromagnetism of semiconductors results from nanoscale crystallographic or chemical phase separations into regions containing a large concentration of the magnetic constituent. We will elaborate experimentally and theoretically epitaxy and co-doping protocols for controlling the self-organised growth of magnetic nanostructures, utilizing broadly synchrotron radiation and nanoscopic characterisation tools. The established methods will allow us to obtain on demand either magnetic nano-dots or magnetic nano-columns embedded in a semiconductor host, for which we predict, and will demonstrate, ground-breaking functionalities. We will also assess reports on the possibility of high-temperature ferromagnetism without magnetic ions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,440,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GALFORMOD"><Rcn>93470</Rcn><Nid>9834</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Galaxy formation models for the next generation of evolutionary and cosmological surveys</Name><PI>Simon David Manton White</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Over the next decade, much effort on major astronomical facilities will be dedicated to large-scale surveys of the galaxy population. Their aim is two-fold: understanding the origin and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes, and clarifying the nature of dark matter, dark energy and the process that produced all cosmic structure. Achieving these goals will require powerful and flexible modelling tools that can simulate galaxy evolution in all viable cosmologies and under a wide variety of assumptions about the governing physical processes. Such capabilities do not currently exist. I propose to develop them through a major expansion of the functionality and scope of the Millennium Simulation archive. New simulations, new theoretical approaches and new web services will allow users to study galaxy formation across the full range of galaxy masses (from dwarf spheroidals to giant cDs). Remote users will be able to change parameters and modelling prescriptions at will, creating virtual surveys of universes with any chosen cosmology and galaxy formation model. Matching to multiwavelength surveys of real galaxies will make it possible to isolate the physical processes driving galaxy evolution, and to characterize the systematic errors that uncertain galaxy formation physics induce in precision estimates of cosmological parameters. Scientific problems where these new capabilities may be decisive in enabling progress include: the role of supermassive black holes in shaping galaxy formation; the origin of diversity in the forms of galaxies and in their nuclear activity; the effects of environment on galaxy structure; the formation history of our own Milky Way; the nature of the first galaxies and their effects on later and more easily observable generations of galaxies; the distribution and nature of dark matter; the origin of all cosmic structure; and the nature of dark energy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,830,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GAUGE-STRING"><Rcn>101677</Rcn><Nid>10446</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Gauge theory- String theory duality: maximally symmetric case and beyond</Name><PI>Arkadi Alexander Tseitline</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Quantum field theories with local gauge symmetry  are building blocks of the modern theory of fundamental interactions between  elementary particles. The basic example  is Quantum Chromo Dynamics. There is strong evidence  that QCD is the correct theory of strong interactions, but it has been difficult to  use it to account  for many hadronic phenomena  which is due to large  value of gauge  coupling  at low  energies. Theoretical  understanding of  gauge theory dynamics at large values of coupling  when one cannot use the Feynman diagram perturbation theory is a major problem of physics of strong interactions. Goals include analytic computation of   mass spectrum of  hadrons, etc. The general aim of this proposal is to develop  new theoretical tools to describe strongly coupled  gauge theories. Research in the last decade brought strong evidence that connection of gauge theories  to string theory should be a key to solution of this  problem. Gauge-string duality and,  in particular,  Anti deSitter / conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is  one of the most active directions  of current work in theory of fundamental interactions. A remarkable progress  was achieved towards quantitative   understanding of this relation  in the most  symmetric case of   maximally  supersymmetric gauge theory in flat 4 dimensions  dual to  superstring theory in curved 10-dimensional AdS5 x S5 space. We propose a detailed study of this duality from the string theory side using world-sheet methods and hidden integrability of the maximally symmetric theory. The goal is to provide  a first-principles  proof of the duality for the spectrum of states and  also to establish its validity at the level of correlation functions of conformal operators. We also plan to extend  string-theoretic approach to gauge-string duality to less symmetric cases, corresponding, in particular, to certain non-supersymmetric conformal and n=1 supersymmetric non-conformal planar gauge theories.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,679,584</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GEM-TRAIT"><Rcn>108430</Rcn><Nid>9246</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>GEM-TRAIT: The Global Ecosystems Monitoring and Trait Study: a novel approach to quantifying the role of biodiversity in the functioning and future of tropical forests</Name><PI>Yadvinder Singh Malhi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal directly addresses one of the great challenges in Earth system science: how will the terrestrial biosphere respond to global atmospheric change and, more specifically, how does the biodiversity of the biosphere moderate or affect that response? This proposal focuses on tropical forests. We are currently unable to understand how tropical forests will respond to climate change because there is (i) a data-deficit: we simply do not have the data to understand the relationship between tropical forest diversity and ecosystem science; and (ii) a theory-deficit: we have not developed an adequate and quantitative theoretical framework to relate functional biodiversity to ecosystem function. This proposal will directly address both these deficits.
Firstly, I will build a unique global tropical ecosystems monitoring network (GEM), that will measure in comprehensive detail the structure, productivity and metabolism of 47 tropical forest sites over a globally synchronous 2.5 year period. In addition, I will develop a large dataset of functional diversity by collecting functional traits of leaves and wood.
Secondly, the theory deficit will be addressed by drawing on the recent development of a novel mathematical formalism that links biodiversity to ecosystem function. This formalism focuses on the distribution of traits within an ecosystem, links this distribution to ecosystem function, and develops predictions of how the shape of the distribution is controlled by environment, biological interactions and previous states of the ecosystem. I will further develop this theory, test its predictions against my unique field data, and ultimately use it to develop a new biodiversity-focussed way of representing tropical forests in ecosystem and Earth system models.

Witten formulated a more mathematically accessible version, in terms of topological field theories. Both conformal and topological field theories can be defined axiomatically, but more interestingly, there are several geometric ways of constructing them.  A priori, the mirror correspondence is not unique, and it does not necessarily remain within a single class of geometric models. The classical case relates $\sigma$-models, but in a more modern formulation, one has mirror dualities between different Landau-Ginzburg models, as well as between such models and $\sigma$-models; orbifolds should also be included in this. The simplest example would be the function $W: \C \rightarrow \C$, $W(x) = x^{n+1}$, which is self-mirror (up to dividing by the $\bZ/n+1$ symmetry group, in an orbifold sense). While the mathematics of the $\sigma$-model mirror correspondence is familiar by now, generalizations to Landau-Ginzburg theories are only beginning to be understood.  Today it is clear that Homologcal Mirror Symmetry (HMS)  as a categorical correspondence works and it is  time for developing direct geometric applications to classical problems - rationality of algebraic varieties and Hodge conjecture. This the main goal of the proposal. But in order to attack the above problems we need to generalize  HMS and explore its connection to new developments in modern Hodge theory.  In order to carry the above program we plan to further already working team Vienna, Paris, Moscow,  MIT."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,060,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GETOM"><Rcn>106950</Rcn><Nid>9716</Nid><HI>Universite Grenoble Alpes, France</HI><Name>Geometry and Topology of Open Manifolds</Name><PI>G&#195;&#169;rard Robert Besson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The purpose of this project is to study the interactions between Riemannian Geometry and the topology of open manifolds. A general question is to find the best Riemannian metric on a given manifold; a related question is to understand the topological consequences of the existence of a metric with given properties. This programme has already been highly successful in the compact case whereas basic questions are not answered in the open case. The key tool which ought to be used in the three items is the Ricci flow with bubbling off,  in dimension 3, described by myself and my collaborators. This opened the way to applying Ricci flow to non-compact manifolds and it is a breakthrough which gives a very optimistic approach to some deep conjectures. The study of Whitehead manifolds will open a wide realm of research  since results are scarce. This will provide work for quite a few graduate students and for several years. My goal is to make such a significant progress that the subject will become proeminent in Riemannian Geometry. Again, for this the Ricci flow will be an unavoidable tool. Constructing explicit Riemannian metrics with various properties is another goal, which pertains to the same circle of ideas, and will lead to a systematic study of these spaces. This is a new and groundbreaking direction of research. I have already obtained some results in these direction and I intend to go much further and to enhance my national and international collaborations using the grant if accepted.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>998,277</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GLASSDEF"><Rcn>104133</Rcn><Nid>8978</Nid><HI>Universite Grenoble Alpes, France</HI><Name>Driven Glasses: from statistical physics to materials properties</Name><PI>Jean-Louis Barrat</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Amorphous systems form a large fraction of the solid materials that surround us, from polymer glasses to mineral or metallic glasses, from toothpaste (a colloidal paste) to granular materials. Still, a theoretical framework for describing the mechanical properties of such materials, comparable to the dislocation theory that describes crystalline systems, is still missing. Our understanding of prominent experimental feature such as the heterogeneous character of deformation, or the temperature and rate dependence of the mechanical response, is very limited.
These materials indeed combine several difficulties. In contrast to liquids or crystals, they are intrinsically out of equilibrium, and their microstructure presents a large statistical distribution of mechanically distinct local environments.  The importance of the notion of heterogeneity in the mechanical behaviour of amorphous systems is being increasingly recognized, still there is no numerical or theoretical model that incorporates this microscopic feature into a macroscopic description of deformation and flow.
The aim of the proposed research program is to build such models, within a multiscale approach seeking inspiration from dislocation dynamics, from the statistical physics of glasses and from the physics of dynamical critical phenomena. The proposed approach is based on a combination of intensive numerical simulations at the atomic scale and at a coarse grained scale, which will necessitate the development of efficient numerical schemes. The statistical analysis will allow us to understand the universal and non universal features of material behaviour in terms of the interactions between the atomic constituents, and to establish the validity and importance of new concepts such as mechanical activation or dynamical heterogeneities.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,763,858</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GLC"><Rcn>93236</Rcn><Nid>11206</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Langlands correspondence and its variants</Name><PI>David Kazhdan</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Sometimes in the sciences there are different yet complementary descriptions for the same object. This extends to the particle-wave duality of quantum mechanics; one mathematical analog of this duality is the Fourier transform. Questions that are difficult when formulated in one language of science may become simple when interpreted in another. The Langlands conjecture posits the existence of a correspondence between problems in arithmetic and in Representation Theory. The Langlands conjecture has only been proven for a limited number of cases, but even this has solved problems such as the famous Fermat conjecture. The aim of this project is to continue study of the "classical" aspects of the Langlands conjecture and to extend the conjecture to the quantum geometric Langlands correspondence, higher-dimensional fields, Kac-Moody groups (with D.Gaitsgory: quantum Langlands correspondence; D.Gaitsgory and E. Hrushevsi: groups over higher-dimensional fields; A. Braverman: Kac-Moody groups; R. Bezrukavnikov, S.Debacker, Y.Varshavsky: classical aspects of the correspondence; A. Berenstein: geometric crystals and crystal bases). The quantum case is much more symmetric than the classical case and can lead in the limit q-&gt;0 to new insights into the classical case. The quantum case is also related to the multiple Dirichlet series. New results in the quantum case would lead to progress in understanding important Number Theoretic questions. Extending the Langlands correspondence to groups over higher-dimensional fields could substantially enlarge its applicability. Studying Kac-Moody groups would provide tools for the new important class of L-functions. This progress could lead to a proof of the existence of the analytic continuation of classical L-functions. The geometric Langlands correspondence is closely related to T-symmetry in 4-dimensional gauge theory and the understanding of this relation is important for both Mathematics and Physics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,277,060</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GLOBALSEIS"><Rcn>89161</Rcn><Nid>12047</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>NEW GOALS AND DIRECTIONS FOR OBSERVATIONAL GLOBAL SEISMOLOGY</Name><PI>Augustinus Nolet</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the major paradoxes in the geosciences is the contrast between the geochemical evidence for limited mass-exchange between lower and upper mantle, and the geophysical arguments for significant mass exchange, needed to prevent the mantle from melting in the geological past. Seismic tomography, when ultimately combined with geodynamical modeling, needs to provide estimates of present-day flux. Indeed, tomography has shown evidence for slabs penetrating into the lower mantle; but no quantitative information on the degree of mass exchange and heat flux can, as yet, reliably be obtained from tomographic images.  It is crucial that the boundary between upper- and lower mantle be imaged at greater precision, certainly in the plume-rich southern hemisphere. This requires a combined effort of improvements both experimentally and theoretically. Much progress has recently been obtained by my group in Princeton before I returned to Europe. I propose to build upon those accomplishments, and to (1) Expand the data acquisition to the oceans by developing hydrophone-equipped floats, with the goal to improve data coverage in regions that are important to investigate heat flux: the plume-rich southern hemisphere in particular, (2) Combine different seismological data sets spanning a wide range of frequencies, with the goal to obtain tomographic images that allow for a quantitative estimate of heat flux (both upwards through plumes and downwards through the sinking of slab fragments), with emphasis on the boundary between upper- and lower mantle, (3) Exploit the extra resolution offered by the frequency-dependent sensitivity of body waves (multifrequency tomography), (4) Incorporate wavelet expansions into the tomographic inversion, with the aim to resolve more detail in the model where the data allow a higher resolution, (5) Obtain a multidisciplinary interpretation of new  tomographic results through interaction with geodynamicists and geochemists.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GLOSTAR"><Rcn>94092</Rcn><Nid>9827</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>A Global View of Star Formation in the Milky Way</Name><PI>Karl M.

We propose to attain a Global View of Star Formation in the Milky Way in a powerful multi-pronged approach. Using VLBI observations of maser sources associated with young protostars, we will measure distances by trigonometric parallax to most of the dominant star forming regions in the Galaxy, which will reveal its spiral structure as well as faithfully represent the luminosity and masses of its constituents. A survey for submillimeter emission from dust, which we are presently pursuing, will deliver the locations of unseen deeply embedded protostars and protoclusters. We plan to combine this data with a comprehensive program to study the gaseous content of the protostellar regions and a very sensitive survey of the Galactic plane with the newly Expanded Very Large Array to find masers and hypercompact HII regions, pinpointing the very centers of the earliest star-forming activity. We also propose to study the infrared emission from more developed massive star clusters, deriving distance with the classic spectro-photometric method, properly calibrated with trigonometric parallaxes, and for the first time adapted to an extensive IR dataset.

Early sources of inspiration are Kirchhoff&#226;&#128;&#153;s theory of electrical networks and the 4-color problem, both from the 19th century. In the 20th century graph theory was one of the most rapidly growing branches of mathematics with applications to theoretical computer science (design and analysis of algorithms), operations research (combinatorial optimization) and models in engineering and economics. The internet may be thought as a graph. There are also strong ties to geometry, topology, probability theory and logic.

The main subjects in the project are graphs in the plane and on higher surfaces, graph decomposition, the Tutte polynomial and the graph flow conjectures, and also combinatorial problems arising from differential geometry. The project is centered around applying new approaches to some classical problems in graph theory, in particular problems in chromatic graph theory and flow theory. In some sense these problems have an algebraic unification in the Tutte polynomial of two variables. The Tutte polynomial has as special valuations (fixing one of the variables) the chromatic polynomial (introduced in 1912 by Birkhoff) and the flow polynomial. More recently, the Tutte polynomial has also become of interest in statistical mechanics.

Among the specific problems to be investigated is Tutte&#226;&#128;&#153;s 3-flow conjecture from the early 1970es, the problem if the flow polynomial can have arbitrarily large roots (motivated by Tutte&#226;&#128;&#153;s 5-flow conjecture), the Merino-Welsh conjecture on the numbers of spanning trees, acyclic orientations and totally cyclic orientations, and Wegner&#226;&#128;&#153;s conjecture from 1977 about squares of planar cubic graphs. We expect to get significant new insight (but not complete solutions) to the two notoriously hard flow conjectures of Tutte (both of which are also described in Wikipedia).

Owing to its spectacular electronic properties graphene is expected to be the most promising candidate to replace classical Si-technology and no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. However, fully exploiting the proposed applications requires the availability of processable graphene in large quantities, which generally has been considered to be an insurmountable challenge. This is where the GRAPHENOCHEM project sets in. Our laboratory has been pioneering and is at the forefront of carbon allotrope chemistry. After having investigated basic principles for the functionalization of the 0-dimensional fullerenes and the 1-dimensional carbon nanotubes, which lead to synthesis of numerous examples of derivatives with tailor made properties, we recently started successfully with the investigation of wet chemical approaches for the efficient production of graphene sheets using graphite as an inexpensive starting material. The strategy of GRAPHENOCHEM is to combine chemistry, nanotechnology and materials science to establish highly efficient protocols for the mass production of soluble graphene and the subsequent processing to a whole variety of thins films, composites and devices with outstanding properties. To our knowledge we are the first synthetic organic chemists facing this challenge. We propose to go through the following sequential key objectives, namely: Development of efficient protocols for the mass production of soluble single layer graphene, cloning of graphene, chemical functionalization and doping of graphene, and engineering of graphene based materials and devices.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,436,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GRBs"><Rcn>89125</Rcn><Nid>11258</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Gamma Ray Bursts as a Focal Point of High Energy Astrophysics</Name><PI>Tsvi Piran</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), short and intense bursts of gamma-rays originating from random directions in the sky, are the brightest explosions in our Universe. They involve ultra-relativistic motion, huge magnetic fields, the strongest gravitational fields, acceleration of photons, neutrinos and cosmic rays to ultra high energies, the collapse of massive stars, mergers of neutron star binaries and formation of newborn black holes. They are at the focal point of relativistic high energy astrophysics and they serve as the best laboratory for extreme physics.    The internal-external shocks model was formulated to explain their inner working. This model had impressive successes in interpreting and predicting GRB properties. Still it had left many fundamental questions unanswered. Furthermore, recently it has been confronted with puzzling Swift observations of the early afterglow and it is not clear if it needs minor revisions or a drastic overhaul.  I describe here an extensive research program that deals with practically all aspects of GRB. From a technical point of view this program involves sophisticated state of the art computations on one hand, fundamental theory and phenomenological analysis of observations and data analysis on the other one.  My goal is to address both old and new open question, considering, among other options the possibility that the current model has to be drastically revised.  My long term goal, beyond understanding the inner working of GRBs, is to create a unified theory of accretion acceleration and collimation and of emission of high energy gamma-rays and relativistic particles that will synergize our understanding of GRBs, AGNs, Microquasars, galactic binary black holes SNRs and other high energy astrophysics phenomena. A second hope is to find ways to utilize GRBs to reveal new  physics that cannot be explored otherwise.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,933,460</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GREENEST"><Rcn>94704</Rcn><Nid>12672</Nid><HI>Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Gas turbine combustion with Reduced EmissioNs Employing extreme STeam injection</Name><PI>Christian Oliver Rudolf Martin Paschereit</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Global energy consumption is continuously increasing, leading to an increased world wide demand for new power generation installations in the near future. In order to protect the earth s climate, energy conversion efficiency and the use of sustainable resources have to be improved significantly to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas CO2. To maintain our high standard of living and to enhance it for developing countries, the improved technologies have to be cost-neutral. Gas turbines play today a major role in energy generation. In the future, gas turbines will become even more important, when old coal-fired steam cycle power plants are replaced by integrated gasification plants. However, current gas turbine technology experiences a flattening technology curve and further increase in total efficiency at low NOx emissions is only achieved in incremental small steps. Additionally, current technology is not prepared to operate on hydrogen-rich fuels from biological resources or coal gasification. A new approach was developed that promises a significant improvement in efficiency and emissions and provides the ability to burn hydrogen-rich fuels. For operation on carbon-containing fuels, it enables CO2 capture at low cost. The concept is based on a high pressure air-steam gas turbine cycle using extremely high amounts of steam. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the fundamentals of ultra wet combustion to develop the technology for a prototype combustor which is capable of burning natural gas, hydrogen and fuels from coal or biowaste gasification at low NOx emissions.

foundations of geometry understanding in dimensions higher than 3.  We
coin the term geometry understanding to encompass a collection
of tasks including the computer representation and the approximation
of geometric structures, and the inference of geometric or topological
properties of sampled shapes.

The need to understand geometric structures is ubiquitous in science
and has become an essential part of scientific computing and
data analysis.
Geometry understanding is by no means limited to
three dimensions. Many applications in physics, biology,
and
engineering require a keen understanding of the geometry of a variety
of higher dimensional spaces to
capture concise information from the underlying often highly
nonlinear structure of
data. Our approach is complementary to manifold learning
techniques and aims at  developing an effective theory for geometric and

To reach these objectives,  the guiding principle will be to foster a
symbiotic relationship between theory and practice, and to address
fundamental research issues along three parallel advancing
fronts. We will simultaneously develop mathematical approaches
providing theoretical guarantees, effective algorithms that are
amenable to theoretical analysis and rigorous experimental validation,
and perennial software development.  We will undertake the
development of a high-quality open source software platform to

A recent paper in Science from the PI&#226;&#128;&#153;s group reported the guided growth of millimeter-long horizontal NWs with controlled orientations on crystal surfaces. The growth directions and crystallographic orientation of GaN NWs are controlled by their epitaxial relationship with different planes of sapphire, as well as by a graphoepitaxial effect that guides their growth along surface steps and grooves. Despite their interaction with the surface, these horizontally grown NWs have surprisingly few defects, exhibiting optical and electronic properties superior to those of vertically grown NWs. We observed that whereas in a 2D film stress accumulates in two directions, in a NW stress accumulates along its axis, but can relax in the transversal direction, making the 1D system much more tolerant to mismatch than a 2D film. This new 1D nanoscale effect, along with the graphoepitaxial effect, subverts the paradigm not only in the young field of NWs, but also in the established field of epitaxy. This paves the way to highly controlled semiconductor structures with potential applications not available by other means.

The aim of this project is to investigate the guided growth of NWs and unleash its vast possibilities toward the realization of self-integrating nanosystems.

First, we will generalize the guided growth of NWs to a variety of semiconductors and substrates, and produce ordered arrays of NWs with coherently modulated composition and doping.

Second, we will conduct fundamental studies to investigate the correlated structure, growth mechanism, optical and electronic properties of guided NWs.

Third, we will exploit the guided growth of NWs for the production of various functional self-integrating systems, including nanocircuits, LEDs, lasers, photovoltaic cells, photodetectors, photonic and nonlinear optical devices.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,063,872</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Gaia-ESO-MW"><Rcn>106947</Rcn><Nid>8788</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Gaia-ESO Milky Way Survey</Name><PI>Gerard Francis Gilmore</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding how galaxies actually form and evolve within our dark matter and dark energy dominated [&#201;&#133;CDM] universe continues to be an enormous challenge. State of the art simulations of the aggregation of cold dark matter under its own gravitational influence suggest that galaxies grow from very smooth initial conditions through a sequence of merger and accretion events. However, theoretical models of galaxy formation, which necessarily involve modelling star formation and stellar evolution, the creation and dispersal of the chemical elements, the formation and energy output of massive black holes, and the response of gas to radiation and supernova shock waves, among much more, rely more heavily on phenomenological models than on a detailed understanding of physical theory. Thus, these models require calibration with well-studied (nearby) test cases of galaxies which we can study in detail, specifically our own Milky Way Galaxy.
The Gaia-ESO Survey is Europe&#226;&#128;&#153;s major ground-based project to meet this scientific challenge.
The Gaia-ESO Survey, which began data-taking in January 2012, has been allocated 300nights of telescope time over five years using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT-UT2) with its premier multi-object spectrograph, FLAMES.  The project will obtain high-quality spectroscopy of some 100,000 faint stars, systematically covering all the major components of the Milky Way. This will provide the first homogeneous overview of the distributions of kinematics and chemical elemental abundances in the Galaxy. With well-defined samples the Survey will quantify the kinematic+ multi-chemical element abundance distribution functions of the bulge, the thick disk, the thin disc, and the halo stellar components.
This proposal is to provide the core support team for the Co-Principal Investigator of the Gaia-ESO Survey with responsibility for the Milky Way Survey.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,978</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Gapwave ICs"><Rcn>108237</Rcn><Nid>12909</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Waveguide-type semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) in gaps between conducting surfaces with texture &#226;&#128;&#147; architecture, electromagnetic modeling and micromachining</Name><PI>Per-Simon Kildal</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>In order to explore and exploit the frequency range from 30 GHz up to THz, new types of transmission lines and semiconductor architectures are needed. Conventional microwave technologies that are commonly used below 30 GHz become either too lossy or are too expensive to manufacture, and technologies used in the optical regime are not usable either. The intermediate frequency band is therefore often referred to as the THz gap, indicating the lack of commercialize-able technologies there.

Professor Kildal has invented a fundamentally new regime of transmission line, referred to as gap waveguides. The basis is newly discovered local waves appearing in the gap between two conducting surfaces, controlled by a texture in one or both of the surfaces. The gap waveguide has been verified below 20 GHz, but it will be more advantageous in the THz gap. The texture will for THz applications be of submillimeter or micrometer scale, realizable by micromachining or etching. Also, there is no need for a dielectric substrate, and there is no need for conductive contact between the two surfaces. Therefore, such gap waveguides and circuits for the THz gap can be manufactured with low cost.

The vision is that the topology of this new regime of gap waveguides will facilitate integration of semiconductor devices, and may lay the foundation for new architectures of transistors and other integrated circuits, being located inside the gap encapsulated by the conductive surfaces themselves. In order to reach this vision new and efficient numerical electromagnetic methods and modeling tools need to be developed, taking advantage of the particular gap waveguide geometry, and being able to connect to or replace the charge transport models for the transistors in the doped semiconductors themselves.

The gap waveguide technology can get a tremendous impact on exploring higher frequencies in radio astronomy, communications, and imaging for medical as well as security applications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GmodGammaDynamics"><Rcn>97217</Rcn><Nid>11787</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Dynamics on homogeneous spaces, spectra and arithmetic</Name><PI>Elon Lindenstrauss</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We consider the dynamics of actions on homogeneous spaces of algebraic groups,

Such states appear in a wide variety of settings including high temperature superconductors, gases of cold atoms and the quark- gluon plasma created in the high-energy collisions of nuclei. Understanding the properties of such strongly coupled quantum matter poses huge conceptual challenges because standard perturbative techniques break down at strong coupling. In a remarkable development, the mathematical framework of string theory has provided a fundamentally new way to study strongly coupled quantum field theories using a dual, weakly coupled gravitational description. Furthermore, this duality states that the phase structure of the quantum field at finite temperature is precisely described by black hole geometries. The principal thrust of the proposal is to develop our understanding of these gravitational techniques in order to make contact with real world systems, particularly in condensed matter physics.

The proposal focuses on four main topics in this emerging, rapidly developing and interdisciplinary field. The first is to extend our understanding of known strongly coupled quantum critical ground states using gravitational solutions and also to search for new ones. The second is to map out the phase structure of strongly coupled quantum field theories at finite temperature by constructing a wide variety of new black hole solutions. Superconducting and spatially modulated phases will be a particular focus. Thirdly, fermion spectral functions will be calculated to extend our understanding of non-Fermi liquids, which are known to arise in many materials. The fourth topic is to explore the behaviour of strongly coupled systems in situations far from thermal equilibrium by studying the dynamical process of black hole formation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,963,542</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="H2-SMS-CAT"><Rcn>97651</Rcn><Nid>11778</Nid><HI>Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet Erlangen Nuernberg, Germany</HI><Name>Engineering of Supported Molten Salt Catalysts for Dehydrogenation Reactions and Hydrogen Production Technologies</Name><PI>Peter Wasserscheid</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The ultimate goal in the development of more efficient catalytic technologies is to combine selectivity, productivity, robustness and ease of processing on the highest possible level. For this purpose, new approaches to integrate molecular catalysis into heterogeneous systems are required. This H2-SMS-CAT project aims to establish homogeneous catalysis in heterogeneous systems in the temperature range of 200&#194;&#176;C to 500&#194;&#176;C. The project will focus on the engineering of Supported Molten Salt catalysts, i.e. materials that contain as the catalytic active film a eutectic molten salt mixture which is immobilized on the high internal surface of an inorganic support. Within the project, the H2-SMS-CAT technology will be exemplified for selected dehydrogenation reactions and hydrogen production technologies. The proposed demonstrator applications are of great technical relevance in the context of hydrogen storage and transportation technologies and for catalytic alkane activation.
Our team is ideally suited to undertake this venture. We are excited by the idea to combine our top-level expertise in ionic liquid/molten salt chemistry, organometallics and reaction engineering to unlock high temperature applications for molecular defined, homogeneous, high temperature dehydrogenation catalysis.

harmonic analysis on $p$-adic and real reductive groups.

Specifically we seek solutions to the local Langlands conjectures
and various normalization problems of discrete series representations.
For $p$-adic groups, affine Hecke algebras are a major technical tool.
Our understanding of these algebras with unequal parameters has
advanced recently and allows us to address these problems.
We will compute the Plancherel measure on the Bernstein components
explicitly. Using a new transfer principle of Plancherel measures
between Hecke algebras we will combine Bernstein components to form
$L$-packets, following earlier work of Reeder in small rank.
We start with the tamely ramified case, building on work of
Reeder-Debacker. We will also explore these methods for $L$-packets
of positive depth, using recent progress due to Yu and others.
Furthermore we intend to study non-tempered
unitary representations via affine Hecke algebras, extending the
work of Barbasch-Moy on the Iwahori spherical unitary dual.

As for real reductive groups we intend to address essential
questions on the convergence of the Fourier-transform. This theory
is widely developed for functions which transform finitely under a
maximal compact subgroup. We wish to drop this condition in order
to obtain global final statements for various classes of rapidly
decreasing functions. We intend to extend our results to certain types of
homogeneous spaces, e.g symmetric and multiplicity one spaces. For doing
so we will embark to develop a suitable spherical character theory for
discrete series representations and solve the corresponding normalization
problems.

Today 40 % of the global energy consumption is processed by electricity in 2040 this may be up to 70 %.

Highly efficient and sustainable power electronics in power generation, power transmission/distribution and end-user applications are introduced to ensure more efficient use of electricity. Traditional centralized electricity production with unidirectional power flows in transmission and distribution system will be replaced by the operation and control of intelligent distribution systems which are much more based on power electronics systems and having bidirectional power flow.

Since its counterpart hydrogen is one of the best studied atoms in physics, a comparison of antihydrogen and hydrogen offers one of the most sensitive tests of CPT symmetry. CPT, the successive application of charge conjugation, parity and time reversal transformation is a fundamental symmetry conserved in the standard model (SM) of particle physics as a consequence of a mathematical theorem. These conditions for this theorem to be fulfilled are not valid any more in extensions of the SM like string theory or quantum gravity. Furthermore, even a tiny violation of CPT symmetry at the time of the big bang could be a cause of the observed antimatter absence in the universe. Thus the observation of CPT violation might offer a first indication for the validity of string theory, and would have important cosmological consequences.
This project proposes to measure the ground state hyperfine (HFS) splitting of antihydrogen (HBAR), which is known in hydrogen with relative precision of 10^&#226;&#128;&#147;12. The experimental method pursued within the ASACUSA collaboration at CERN-AD consists in the formation of an antihydrogen beam and a measurement using a spin-flip cavity and a sextupole magnet as spin analyser like it was done initially for hydrogen. A major milestone was achieved in 2010 when antihydrogen was first synthesized by ASACUSA. In the first phase of this proposal, an antihydrogen beam will be produced and the HBAR-HFS will be measured to a precision of around 10^&#226;&#128;&#147;7 using a single microwave cavity. In a second phase, the Ramsey method of separated oscillatory fields will be used to increase the precision further. In parallel methods will be developed towards trapping and laser cooling the antihydrogen atoms. Letting the cooled antihydrogen escape in a field free region and perform microwave spectroscopy offers the ultimate precision achievable to measure the HBAR-HFS and one of the most sensitive tests of CPT.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,599,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HECTOR"><Rcn>97953</Rcn><Nid>12840</Nid><HI>Universidad De Zaragoza, Spain</HI><Name>MICROWAVE-ASSISTED MICROREACTORS: DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY EFFICIENT GAS PHASE CONTACTOR WITH DIRECT CATALYST HEATING</Name><PI>Jes&#195;&#186;s Marcos Santamar&#195;&#173;a Ramiro</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"While heterogeneous catalysis is often considered a mature science, the so-called enabling technologies are often able to produce significant enhancements in the rate of reaction or in the selectivity towards a given product.

To implement this innovative technology, we will deploy different materials that are sensitive to microwave radiation (zeolite films with/without deposition of metallic particles, metallic films and nanoparticles) on the channels of microreactors made of materials that are transparent to microwaves. A basic study of adsorption and heating processes under microwave irradiation will lead to the selection of materials and conditions that enable operation under a significant temperature difference between the catalyst and the gas phase. The advantages obtained from this novel concept will be exploited in specific, industrially important, reaction processes (CO oxidation in H2 streams; VOC combustion in lean mixtures; ethylene epoxidation), where significant improvements in reaction yield and/or operating costs are expected. At the same time, new scientific and technological insight will be gained in the area of catalyst heating by microwaves."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,851,179</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HELIOS"><Rcn>110460</Rcn><Nid>9179</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Towards Total Scene Understanding using Structured Models</Name><PI>Philip Hilaire Sean Torr</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project is at the interface between computer vision and linguistics: the aim is to have an algorithm generate relevant sentences that describe a scene given one or more images.

Scene understanding has been one of the central goals in computer vision for many decades. It involves various individual tasks, such as object recognition, action understanding and 3D scene recovery. One simple definition of this task is to say scene understanding is equivalent to being able to generate meaningful natural language descriptions of a scene, an important problem in computational linguistics. Whilst even a child can do this with ease, the solution of this fundamental problem has remained elusive. This is because there has been a large amount of research in computer vision that is very deep, but not broad, leading to an in depth understanding of edge and feature detectors, tracking, camera calibration, projective geometry, segmentation, denoising, stereo methods, object detection etc. However, there has been only a limited amount of research on a framework for integrating these functional elements into a method for scene understanding.

Within this proposal I advocate a complete view of computer vision, in which the scene is dealt with as a whole, in which problems which are normally considered distinct by most researchers are unified into a common cost function or energy. I will discuss the form the energy should take and efficient algorithms for learning and inference. Our preliminary experiments indicate that such a unified treatment will lead to a paradigm shift in computer vision with a quantum leap in performance. We intend to build embodied demonstrators including a prosthetic vision aid to the visually impaired. The World Health Organization gives a figure of over 300 million such people world wide, which means that in addition to being transformative in the areas of linguistics, HCI, robotics, and computer vision, this work will have a massive impact world wide"</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,495</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HELIOS"><Rcn>101489</Rcn><Nid>12615</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Heavy Element Laser Ionization Spectroscopy</Name><PI>Pieter Van Duppen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The aim of this proposal is to develop a novel laser-spectroscopy method and to study nuclear and atomic properties of heaviests elements in order to address the following key questions:
- Is the existence of the heaviest isotopes determined by the interplay between single-particle and collective nucleon degrees of freedom in the atomic nucleus?
- How do relativistic effects and isotopic composition influence the valence atomic structure of the heaviest elements?

The new approach is based on in-gas jet, high-repetition, high-resolution laser resonance ionization spectroscopy of short-lived nuclear-reaction products stopped in a buffer gas cell. The final goal is to couple the new system to the strongest production facility under construction at the ESFRI-listed SPIRAL-2 facility at GANIL (France) and to study isotopes from actinium to nobelium and heavier elements.
An increase of the primary intensity, efficiency, selectivity and spectral resolution by one order of magnitude compared to present-day techniques is envisaged, which is essential to obtain the required data .

The challenges are:
- decoupling the high-intensity heavy ion production beam (&gt; 10^14 particles per second) from the low-intensity reaction products (few atoms per second)
- cooling of the reaction products from MeV/u to meV/u within less then hundred milliseconds
- separating the wanted from the, by orders of magnitude overwhelming, unwanted isotopes
- performing high-resolution laser spectroscopy on a minute amount of atoms in an efficient way.

Nuclear properties (charge radii, nuclear moments and spins) as well as atomic properties (transition energies and ionization potentials) will be deduced in regions of the nuclear chart where they are not known: the neutron-deficient isotopes of the actinide elements, up to nobelium (Z = 102) and beyond. The data will validate state-of-the-art calculations, identify critical weaknesses and guide further theoretical developments.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,458,397</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HEPGAME"><Rcn>106927</Rcn><Nid>12826</Nid><HI>Stichting Voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek Der Materie - Fom, Netherlands</HI><Name>Solving High Energy Physics Equations using Monte Carlo Gaming Techniques</Name><PI>Jozef Antoon Maria Vermaseren</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The main objective of this proposal is to perform (hitherto unsolved) calculations in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) most of which are urgently needed to make optimal use of upcoming experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider.

We will make use of the brand new technique of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) from the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and gaming to resolve this issue and automatize the derivation of formulas and the construction of computer programs.

In order to take a great leap forward in cantilever-like sensing I suggest a new generation of simplified and optimized cantilever-like sensing structures implemented in a DVD based platform which will specifically address these issues.

My overall hypothesis is that the true potential of these exciting sensors can only be released when using a simple and reliable read-out system that allows us to focus on the mechanical performance of the sensors. Thus we will keep the sensors as simple as possible. The DVD readout makes it possible to generate large amount of data and to focus on mechanics and the interplay between mechanics, optics and electrochemistry. It will be a technological challenge to realize a robust and reliable DVD  platform, that facilitates optical read-out as well as actuation. The DVD platform will enable a fast and iterative development of hybrid cantilever-like systems which draw upon our more than 10 years experience in the field. These sensors will be realised using Si and polymer based cleanroom fabrication. Focus is on design, fabrication, characterization and applications of cantilever-like sensors and on DVD inspired system integration.

This technique uses the ergodic theory of flows on homogeneous spaces (homogeneous flows for short), and builds on my recent breakthrough in the case of the Lorentz gas (in joint with Andreas Str&#195;&#182;mbergsson, Uppsala). The key feature of the proposed approach is measure rigidity, a deep and powerful technical tool that has so far mainly seen success in solving long-standing problems in number theory and quantum chaos. The arguments developed in this proposal are not only interesting from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint, but also yield a heuristic mechanism for finding previously unknown kinetic transport equations that incorporate the effects of long-range order in microscopic particle distributions.

Graphs play a key role in many application areas of mathematics, providing the perfect mathematical description of all systems that are governed by pairwise interactions, in computer science, economics, biology and more. But graphs cannot fully capture scenarios in which interactions involve more than two agents. Since the theory of hypergraphs is still too under-developed, we resort to geometry and topology, which view a graph as a one-dimensional simplicial complex. I want to develop a combinatorial/geometric/probabilistic theory of higher-dimensional simplicial complexes. Inspired by the great success of random graph theory and its impact on discrete mathematics both theoretical and applied, I intend to develop a theory of random simplicial complexes.
This combinatorial/geometric point of view and the novel high-dimensional perspective, shed new light on many fundamental combinatorial objects such as permutations, cycles and trees. We show that they all have high-dimensional analogs whose study leads to new deep mathematical problems. This holds a great promise for real-world applications, in view of the prevalence of such objects in  application domains.
Even basic aspects of graphs, permutations etc. are much more sophisticated and subtle in high dimensions. E.g., it is a key result that randomly evolving graphs undergo a phase transition and a sudden emergence of a giant component. Computer simulations of the evolution of higher-dimensional simplicial complexes, reveal an even more dramatic phase transition. Yet, we still do not even know what is a higher-dimensional giant component.
I also show how to use simplicial complexes (deterministic and random) to construct better error-correcting codes. I suggest a new conceptual approach to the search for high-dimensional expanders, a goal sought by many renowned mathematicians.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,754,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HIGHZ"><Rcn>91067</Rcn><Nid>11670</Nid><HI>Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>HIGHZ: Elucidating galaxy formation and evolution from very deep Near-IR imaging</Name><PI>Marijn Franx</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Studies of high redshift galaxies require very deep Near-IR imaging.

The most common industrial method to produce enantiopure compounds is still chiral resolution, which wastes half of the material. This surprises considering that catalytic methods are potentially cost-, energy, and resource-saving, have a lesser impact on the environment, and are in line with the general concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. Recently organocatalysis has grown into one of three fundamental classes of asymmetric catalysts complementing metal- and biocatalysis.  In principle, organocatalysts have many beneficial features such as air and moisture stability, non-toxicity, and easy accessibility, making them attractive for industrial applications. However, most organocatalysts are insufficiently active and require high catalysts loadings, counterbalancing these positive features. Remarkably, of the four types of organocatalysts, Br&#195;&#184;nsted bases and acids, and Lewis bases, and acids, organic Lewis acid catalysts have been almost entirely ignored. Very recently though, within the group of the applicant, the finding was made that such catalysts can be extremely active and enantioselective, suggesting the possibility for truly high performance organocatalysis. This proposal therefore aims at the design of novel organic Lewis acid catalysts, their exploration in asymmetric catalysis, and their mechanistic understanding. The program is expected to lead the way towards the next generation organocatalysts, which will rival the efficiency of the most active metal- and biocatalysts, and have the potential to profoundly change the way chiral molecules are made.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,490,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HIStoryNU"><Rcn>102332</Rcn><Nid>10392</Nid><HI>Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Netherlands</HI><Name>The HI Story of Galaxy Evolution in the Nearby Universe</Name><PI>Jan Mathijs Van Der Hulst</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Current radio telescopes have imaged the HI in and around a few hundred galaxies in the nearby universe, but to reach out into the universe to the time when the decline in star formation started will require new facilities. An essential ingredient in the process of galaxy formation and evolution is the balance between the acquisition of gas through merging and accretion and the depletion of gas through stripping and outflows induced by star formation and in some cases active galactic nuclei (AGN). This balance will depend on the environment. The life long gas supply and regulation of this balance will determine what kind of galaxy emerges in the end. The strong decline in star formation density in the universe over the last 7-8 Gyr indicates strong evolution. To be able to understand this evolution it is necessary to assess the balance between the acquisition and depletion of gas in many individual galaxies and many different environments over this period of cosmic time.
In less than two years the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) will be upgraded with a wide field capability using the novel technology of phased array feeds (PAFs) developed in the Netherlands. This system, named APERTIF, will make it possible to survey large areas of sky rapidly to depths covering the last 3 Gyr of cosmic time.
This proposal requests funding for harvesting the huge potential of the APERTIF system. It focuses on analyzing the data of a blind, medium deep survey of HI out to a distance of 1250 Mpc (a redshift of z = 0.25) covering an area of ~500 deg2 (or a volume of over 30 million Mpc3) to explore the balance between gas acquisition and gas removal processes in galaxies in different environments. This balance is fundamental to the way galaxies evolve. Primary goal is to obtain a full inventory of this balance and show which processes dominate in which environments.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HOLMES"><Rcn>110913</Rcn><Nid>10811</Nid><HI>Istituto Nazionale Di Fisica Nucleare, Italy</HI><Name>The Electron Capture Decay of 163Ho to Measure the Electron Neutrino Mass with sub-eV sensitivity</Name><PI>Stefano Ragazzi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"HOLMES is aimed at directly measuring the electron neutrino mass using the electron capture (EC) decay of 163Ho.
The measurement of the absolute neutrino mass represents a major breakthrough in particle physics and cosmology. Due to their abundance as big-bang relics, massive neutrinos strongly affect the large-scale structure and dynamics of the universe. In addition, the knowledge of the scale of neutrino masses, together with their hierarchy pattern, is invaluable to clarify the origin of fermion masses beyond the Higgs mechanism.
The innovative approach of HOLMES consists in the calorimetric measurement of the energy released in the decay of 163Ho. In this way, all the atomic de-excitation energy is measured, except that carried away by the neutrino. A finite neutrino mass m causes a deformation of the energy spectrum which is truncated at Q-m, where Q is the EC transition energy. The sensitivity depends on Q - the lower the Q, the higher the sensitivity - and 163Ho is an ideal isotope with a Q around 2.5keV. The direct measurement exploits only energy and momentum conservation, and it is therefore completely model-independent. At the same time, the calorimetric measurement eliminates systematic uncertainties arising from the use of external beta sources, as in neutrino mass measurements with beta spectrometers, and minimizes the effect of the atomic de-excitation process uncertainties.
HOLMES will deploy a large array of low temperature microcalorimeters with implanted 163Ho nuclei. The resulting mass sensitivity will be as low as 0.4eV. HOLMES will be an important step forward in the direct neutrino mass measurement with a calorimetric approach as an alternative to spectrometry. It will also establish the potential of this approach to extend the sensitivity down to 0.1eV.
The detection techniques developed for HOLMES will have an impact in many frontier fields as astrophysics, material analysis, nuclear safety, archeometry, quantum communication."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,057,067</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HOME"><Rcn>188487</Rcn><Nid>12187</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Habitability of Martian Environments: Exploring the Physiological and Environmental Limits of Life</Name><PI>Dirk Schulze-Makuch</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The low average temperature and low water activity of the Martian near-surface environment makes it challenging for living organisms to persist and propagate.

Furthermore, specific soil minerals, or combinations thereof, appear to provide a suitable habitat for microbial life, especially if associated with low-temperature brines or hygroscopic salts. Thus, a quantitative understanding of the habitability potential of the Martian near-surface environment, past and present, is very much needed and the focus of this proposal.

By such the project aims to reach a convergence between the microscopic and macroscopic world. To this end, the planned research will span the range from isolated atoms in the high vacuum to the real species present in solution. Specifically, the proposal is focused on:

- Ion solvation in dipolar media (e.g. aqueous salt solutions)
- Influence of sequential solvation on redox processes (relevant in corrosion, for example)
- Mechanisms by which metal catalysts facilitate chemical reactions (e.g. polymerizations)

In order to address these tasks, the PI will combine his profound expertise in gas-phase methods  with well-established techniques from solution chemistry for the development of new and innovative coupling techniques which will allow to derive direct correlations between micro- and macroscopic properties. A particular highlight is the planned online-coupling of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry, which is unique worldwide and offers the exploration of new dimensions for both, EPR methods and ESI mass spectrometry.
While the project is located in chemical sciences, physical-organic chemistry in particular, the prospects of the proposal range not only far beyond the PI's specific field of specialization into other areas of chemistry, but due to the enormous relevance of ion solvation, redox processes, and catalysis also into biological, physical and geological sciences with implications up to our daily life.

Both areas exploit the stereoelectronic influence of the C-F bond, and its interaction with nearby functional groups. In particular the polar nature of the C-F bond is now used as a design feature to manipulate molecular conformation across a range of case studies, judged to be of contemporary interest. One aspect of the programme will prepare a series of compounds containing multiple fluoromethylene groups. Care will be taken to prepare individual stereoisomers for comparitive studies.

Some functional appear frequently in biochemistry. The programme will utilise the stereogenic placement of the C-F bond in the design of neurotransmitter analogues, to influence and explore their binding conformation to receptors.

This property offers unique opportunities for fast electronics, if we can somehow learn to control the dynamics of particles which have a charge but no mass. Fresh ideas are needed for this purpose, since an electric field is incapable of stopping a massless electron (its velocity being energy independent).

The applicant and his group at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics in Leiden University have started exploring the new physics of graphene soon after the announcement two years ago of the discovery of massless electrons in this material. We have identified several promising control mechanisms, and are now ready to embark on a systematic search. Our objective is to discover ways to manipulate in a controlled manner three independent electronic degrees of freedom: charge, spin, and valley.

The charge is the primary carrier of classical information, being strongly coupled to the environment, while the spin is the primary carrier of quantum information, in view of its weak coupling to the environment. The valley degree of freedom (which defines the chirality of the massless particles) is intermediate between charge and spin with regard to the coupling to the environment, and provides some unique opportunities for control. In particular, we have the idea that by acting on the valley rather than on the charge it would be possible to fully block the electronic current (something which an electric field by itself is incapable of). To study these effects we will need to develop new methodologies, since the established methods to model quantum transport in nanostructures are unsuitable for massless carriers."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,563,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HYDRA-CHEM"><Rcn>88589</Rcn><Nid>9856</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Hydrothermal and Ionothermal Chemistry For Sustainable Materials (HYDRA-CHEM)</Name><PI>Markus Antonietti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal aims to develop a novel type of chemistry by using hydrothermal or ionothermal reaction conditions to generate novel materials and polymers in a more sustainable fashion.

That way, it is expected that HYDRA-Chem can expand synthetic chemistry in the direction of high temperatures and rather unusual solvent conditions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,461,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HYMAGINE"><Rcn>94773</Rcn><Nid>9086</Nid><HI>Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, France</HI><Name>Hybrid CMOS/Magnetic components and systems for energy efficient, non-volatile, reprogrammable integrated electronics</Name><PI>Bernard Dieny</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Spinelectronics merges magnetism and electronics (Nobel Prize 2007). Besides its fundamental interest, it has found applications in hard disk drives (1998) and in non-volatile standalone memories (MRAM, on market since 2006). MRAMs integrate CMOS components with magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ). The PI and his team are convinced that besides MRAMs, this hybrid CMOS/MTJ technology can yield a totally new approach in the way electronic devices are designed. Most CMOS devices such as microprocessors are based on Von Neumann architecture in which logic and memories are separate components. The unique set of characteristics combined within MTJs: cyclability, switching speed, scalability, makes it possible to conceive novel electronic systems in which logic and memory are intimately combined in non-volatile logic components (non-volatile CPU). Such systems would have outstanding advantages in terms of energy savings, logic-memory communication speed, ultrafast reprogrammability, compactness, design simplicity. The objective of this project is to lay the fundation of this novel approach, which requires addressing both fundamental and more applied issues. The basic issues concern the improvement and reliability of spintronic materials, mastering the speed and coherence of magnetization switching, developing tools for the quantitative interpretation of MTJ properties and for designing hybrid CMOS/MTJ devices. The applied goals are the conception, building and testing of a few illustrative devices demonstrating the outstanding advantages of this technology. A further one is to establish an internationally recognized roadmap for this non-volatile logic. If successful, its impact on European microelectronics and magnetism industry could be huge.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HYMEM"><Rcn>97811</Rcn><Nid>11486</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Hybrid Nanosystems in phospholipid membranes</Name><PI>Jochen Feldmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The cell membrane is the biological platform for many vital processes such as photosynthesis, cell-cell contact, biomolecular recognition, endocytosis and ion transport.

Techniques are now available that provide experimental access to hyperpolarized molecules, in which NMR signals are enhanced by up to 5 orders of magnitude, with potentially revolutionary implications. However, the lifetime of the hyperpolarized state is usually limited by the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time, called T1, and which is typically in the range of a few seconds to about 1 minute. The range of applications accessible to hyperpolarized NMR is restricted by the need to use the hyperpolarized substance within this short timescale. In this proposal, we aim to extend the lifetime of hyperpolarized substances by exploiting a phenomenon first described in our laboratory - namely the exceptional lifetime of nuclear singlet states. These are quantum superposition states of nuclear spin pairs which are protected against many common relaxation mechanisms, with experimentally demonstrated lifetimes of up to 25 minutes. We will (i) identify, design and synthesize substances that support nuclear spin states with especially long lifetimes; (ii) design and demonstrate methodology for hyperpolarizing long-lived nuclear singlet states; (iii) perform test-of-principle experiments showing enhanced NMR imaging of flow and diffusion using hyperpolarized nuclear singlet states, in contexts emulating those found in clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (iv) design and demonstrate experiments and molecular systems that allow the hyperpolarized singlet order to be transformed into magnetization of strongly magnetic nuclei such as protons, with benefits to the signal strength and to the spatial resolution. In summary we will bridge the gap between the high promise of long-lived nuclear singlet states and the world of real applications, with an emphasis on demonstrating the feasibility of real-world in vivo NMR and MRI applications."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,877,583</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Hi-SENS"><Rcn>106792</Rcn><Nid>10907</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Surface Enhanced NMR Spectroscopy</Name><PI>David Lyndon Emsley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The ability to determine molecular structures from single crystals by diffraction methods has transformed science. However, if the system under investigation is located at a surface, the problem of structure elucidation is largely unsolved. Due to the increasing frequency with which such samples are encountered, particularly in the area of new materials for energy and catalysis, there is a critical need for the development of new methods for structure characterization of surfaces.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy would be the method of choice for characterizing surfaces were it not that the detection limit is far too low to allow many modern materials to be examined. The sensitivity of NMR thus poses the major limitation to surface characterization.
We recently introduced a new approach using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) to enhance surface NMR signals. The project will capitalize on this new concept and develop DNP surface enhanced NMR spectroscopy (DNP SENS) through a series of new concepts to address the following challenges: (i) to characterize materials with surface areas three orders of magnitude lower than currently, specifically to detect surface NMR signals from materials with surface areas of ~1 m2/g, rather than ~1000 m2/g today; and (ii) to determine structure-activity relationships in advanced functional materials, specifically by developing NMR correlation methods capable of determining structure and dynamics of surface species in conjunction with DNP SENS.
These objectives require a gain in DNP SENS sensitivity of three orders of magnitude, and we propose to do this through innovative NMR experiments, better DNP enhancements, isotopic labeling, and high magnetic fields. The approaches go well beyond the frontier of current research.
The project will yield a broadly applicable method for structural characterization of complex surfaces not previously available by any other approach, resulting in new chemistry and chemical processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,449,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HiPERCAM"><Rcn>111266</Rcn><Nid>10109</Nid><HI>The University Of Sheffield, United Kingdom</HI><Name>HiPERCAM: A high-speed camera for the study of rapid variability in the Universe</Name><PI>Vikram Dhillon</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>When stars die, they form white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes. These are key objects in astrophysics as their extreme gravities, densities and pressures allow us to test our theories of fundamental physics at the limits of their predictive powers. One of the best ways of studying white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes is via their variations in brightness. Unfortunately, due to the small physical sizes of these objects, they are extremely faint and their variability occurs on timescales of milliseconds to seconds, too fast to be recorded by the current generation of astronomical instruments on the world's largest telescopes.

What is required is a new type of astronomical instrument with the capability to take high-speed exposures with no noise from either the detector or the atmosphere. Such an instrument would enable us to answer some of the most important questions in astrophysics, such as: What are the progenitors of type Ia supernovae? What is the equation of state of the degenerate matter found in white dwarfs and neutron stars? What is the nature of the flow of matter close to the event horizon of black holes? What gravitational wave signals are likely to be detected by the next generation of space and ground-based detectors?

My aim is to answer the above questions by building and exploiting a new astronomical instrument: HiPERCAM. HiPERCAM will be by far the best high-speed camera in the world, giving an order of magnitude improvement in performance over what has come before. It will be mounted on the world's best telescopes, including the 8.2-m VLT in Chile and the 10.4-m GTC on La Palma. This revolutionary new camera will incorporate a novel scintillation-correction mechanism and the latest in low-noise, high-speed detector technology. Although challenging, my track record with previous related instruments (e.g. ULTRACAM) and my preceding technology demonstration projects shows that my proposed research programme is feasible.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,491,336</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HierarSACol"><Rcn>102371</Rcn><Nid>10386</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Hierarchical Self Assembly of Colloids: Control and Manipulation from Nano-Granular</Name><PI>Alfons Van Blaaderen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Goal: to significantly extend our ability to manipulate the Self Assembly (SA) of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) into complex 1D/2D/3D architectures (regular clusters, (composite)strings/rods, sheets, submicron colloidal crystals/liquid crystal phases of the NPs) over multiple length scales going from nano to that of granular matter. In the nano-regime quantum size effects cause materials properties to become strongly size dependent and thus highly tunable. Moreover, the synthesis of many NPs (metals, semiconductors, magnetic materials) is advanced enough that they can be made to crystallize into regular 3D lattices with new exciting functionality caused by collective effects. By performing SA in several independent stages, materials properties can be further tailored in new ways because of both access to different length scales and different NP combinations. In order to make systematic progress we will determine inter-NP potentials using 3D imaging. Both using subdiffractive confocal microscopy and cryogenic tomographic transmission electron microscopy. We will also use external fields (optical tweezers, electric/magnetic fields, shear) both to realize the complex architectures, but also to change particle properties dynamically. E.g., in monodisperse droplets of nematic phases of luminescent rodlike NPs an electric field can dramatically affect the scattering and emission of individual droplets. The droplets can subsequently be ordered in strings, sheets or crystals. Repeating the SA again delivers supra structures on the granular scale to tune e.g. heat or reagent flows. These projects combined will not only deliver new fundamental knowledge on SA, but the results are also expected to be directly useful for realizing applications based on the new meta-materials realized such as in displays, lighting, (optical) storage, (bio)sensing, catalysis, spintronics, photonic crystals, and the opto-electronics field in general.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,334</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Higgs@LHC"><Rcn>106801</Rcn><Nid>9662</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Search and study of the Higgs bosons at the LHC</Name><PI>Abdelhak Djouadi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The major issue and the forefront research activity in particle physics today
is the exploration of the mechanism that generates the elementary particle
masses.  In the Standard Model that describes three of the four basic  forces in
nature - the electromagnetic, weak and strong  interactions - this fundamental
mechanism leads to the existence of a new type of  particle, the Higgs boson,
which has escaped detection so far. The discovery of this  particle, which will
have a paramount importance and far-reaching implications, is the major goal of
the CERN Large Hadron Collider which  recently started operation after 20 years
of preparation. The observation of the Higgs boson at the LHC and the
determination of its fundamental properties will  be the  essential issue
addressed by the present research project.  A comprehensive investigation of the
various Higgs boson detection channels at the LHC, production mechanisms and
decay  modes,  as well as the major sources of backgrounds will be performed in
a way that is as close as possible to the experimental conditions.  Precise
theoretical  predictions, including higher order quantum effects, will be
provided and the associated  uncertainties will be assessed. The implications of
observing the Higgs particle for the Standard Model and  for new physics beyond
it, such as supersymmetric theories and models with extra space-time
dimensions, will  be investigated in detail. Besides the  Principal Investigator
who will devote 80% of his time on the project, the research team will be
formed by theoretical physicists from three  laboratories in the Paris area, LPT
Orsay, LPTHE Jussieu and IPhT Saclay, as well as a staff member of the CERN

two PhD students that will be appointed. The duration of the project, five
years, will crucially coincide with the period in which the LHC is expected to
make major breakthroughs in the field under investigation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,160,005</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HighTeich"><Rcn>93905</Rcn><Nid>11530</Nid><HI>Universite De Nice Sophia Antipolis, France</HI><Name>Higher Teichm&#195;&#188;ller-Thurston Theory: Representations of Surface Groups in PSL(n,R)</Name><PI>Fran&#195;&#167;ois Pierre Calixte Labourie</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Higher Teichm&#195;&#188;ller-Thurston theory is the study of a specific component of representations of a surface group of genus g in PSL(n,R).

To quote but a few: arithmetic (through the study of automorphic forms), geometry (Thurston's theory of hyperbolic structures), dynamics (the ergodic properties of the geodesic flow) and physics (conformal field theory and representations of the Virasoro algebra).

For the life we know, liquid water on the planetary surface is a prerequisite. However, a direct detection of liquid water on exoplanets, and especially on a potentially habitable Earth-size planet, is not yet possible. The existence of water almost certainly implies the presence of atmospheric water vapour which must evaporate under stellar irradiation from a cloud deck or from the surface, together with other related molecules. Therefore, devising sensitive methods to detect hot molecules on exoplanets is of high importance.  This proposal develops several exploratory theoretical and observational aspects of precision spectropolarimetry for detecting water vapour and other volatiles on exoplanets and in the inner part of protoplanetary disks. These are new tools for making progress in our understanding which fraction of planets acquires water and how planet formation influences their habitability. As a &#226;&#128;&#156;double differential&#226;&#128;&#157; technique, spectropolarimetry has enormous advantages for dynamic range problems, like detection of weak line signals against a large stellar background and exploration at scales beyond the angular resolution of telescopes, which are crucial for both exoplanets and inner disks. Direct detection of polarized spectral lines enables recovering precise orbits of exoplanets (including non-transiting systems) and evaluating their masses as well as potentially their magnetic fields. First applied to hot Jupiters the developed tools will create a firm foundation for future exploration of Earth-like planets with larger telescopes. The same technique applied to planetesimals in the inner disks of young stars yields their orbits, temperature, and chemical composition. These will provide constraints on the formation of a planetary atmosphere in the vicinity of the star and its habitable zone.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,436,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HydrationLube"><Rcn>94096</Rcn><Nid>11520</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Hydration lubrication: exploring a new paradigm</Name><PI>Jacob Klein</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In recent years, as first established in some 6 papers in Science and Nature from the PI s group, a new paradigm has emerged. This reveals the remarkable and unsuspected - role of hydration layers in modulating frictional forces between sliding surfaces or molecular layers in aqueous media, termed hydration lubrication, in which the lubricating mode is completely different from the classic one of oils or surfactants. In this project we address the substantial challenges that have now arisen: what are the underlying mechanisms controlling this effect? what are the potential breakthroughs that it may lead to? We will answer these questions through several interrelated objectives designed to address both fundamental aspects, as well as limits of applicability. We will use surface force balance (SFB) experiments, for which we will develop new methodologies, to characterize normal and frictional forces between atomically smooth surfaces where the nature of the surfaces (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, metallic, polymeric), as well as their electric potential, may be independently varied. We will examine mono- and multivalent ions to establish the role of relaxation rates and hydration energies in controlling the hydration lubrication, will probe hydration interactions at both hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces and will monitor slip of hydrated ions past surfaces. We will also characterize the hydration lubrication properties of a wide range of novel surface systems, including surfactants, liposomes, polymer brushes and, importantly, liposomes, using also synchrotron X-ray reflectometry for structural information. Attainment of these objectives should lead to conceptual breakthroughs both in our understanding of this new paradigm, and for its practical implications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,304,180</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ICD"><Rcn>89065</Rcn><Nid>9712</Nid><HI>Ruprecht-Karls-Universit&#195;&#164;t Heidelberg, Germany</HI><Name>Intermolecular Coulombic decay and control of photoinduced processes in physics, chemistry, and biology</Name><PI>Lorenz S.

The ICD has been predicted theoretically by the applicant and co-workers and has recently found full confirmation in a series of spectacular experiments. The theoretical and experimental work on ICD performed until now and the progress achieved established the generality of the phenomenon and open new horizons for the ICD research. There is an enormous potential inherent in the ICD and the present proposal is aimed at exploring and exploiting it in systems of physical, chemical, and biological interest. In particular, the high efficiency of the ICD compared to various photoinduced processes like photon emission, isomerization, and charge transfer, makes the ICD extremely attractive for quenching in a controllable fashion such fundamental processes in biophysically relevant systems. Furthermore, the ICD phenomenon produces low-energy electrons and can be expected to be a relevant source of such electrons in nature. It has been proven that low-energy electrons induce serious damages in DNA  and it is natural to investigate the importance of the ICD in the production of such electrons after irradiation. We are convinced of the fundamental and practical relevance of ICD and our vision is to be able to exploit this basic process in systems of interest. To achieve this breakthrough requires an enormous investment in advancing methodologies. This, in turn, can only be reached by a highly motivated strong team of scientists closely collaborating over a long period of time. The support by the ERC can substantially contribute to the realization of this vision.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,950,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ICE&amp;LASERS"><Rcn>102186</Rcn><Nid>10413</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Innovative Concepts for Extracting climate and atmospheric composition records from polar ice cores using new LASER Sensors</Name><PI>Jerome Chappellaz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>ICE&amp;LASERS propose to make a breakthrough in two challenges of paleoclimate science:

(1) Extending the Antarctic ice core records to 1.5 million years ago is critical to understand the unexplained climate shift from 40,000-year periodicities to 100,000-year ones, calling for a different climate sensitivity to orbital forcing. We propose to revolutionize ice core science by building an innovative probe making its own way into the ice sheet within a single field season, to measure in situ the depth profile of H2O isotopes in ice as well as greenhouse gas concentration in trapped gases, down to bedrock. This high gain/high risk project will allow us to rapidly qualify different &#226;&#128;&#156;oldest ice&#226;&#128;&#157; sites, and to immediately obtain the main climatic signals of interest;

(2) Why the atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations varied by up to 40 and 100%, respectively, during glacial-interglacial cycles is still highly debated. We will combine revolutionary detectors with new extraction techniques to measure with unsurpassed accuracy and resolution the concentrations of CH4, CO2 and CO (a tracer related to the CH4 cycle), and the isotopic ratios of CO2 and CO in polar ice. We will constrain theories of past changes in the carbon cycle and of climate feedbacks, and will provide more insight into possible natural feedbacks under a warming future.

ICE&amp;LASERS tackles both scientific challenges, thanks to an analytical revolution for measuring trace gases and their stable isotopes: Optical-Feedback Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (OFCEAS), recently patented by one of the four CNRS research units involved in the project.

The ICEMASS project will derive and analyse glacier thickness changes using satellite laser and radar altimetry, and satellite-derived and other digital elevation models, and convert these to a global glacier mass budget. Such data set will enable major steps forward in glacier and Earth science, in particular: constrain current sea-level contribution from glaciers; complete climate change patterns as reflected in glacier mass changes; quantify the contribution of glacier imbalance to river run-off; allow to separate glacier mass loss from other components of gravity changes as detected through satellite gravimetry; and allow improved modelling of the isostatic uplift component due to current changes in glacier load.
These results will be connected to global-scale glacier dynamics, for which a global set of repeat optical and radar satellite images will be processed to measure displacements due to glacier flow and their annual to decadal-scale changes. The analysis of these data will enable several major steps forward in glacier and Earth science, in particular: progress the understanding of glacier response to climate and its changes; provide new insights in processes underlying spatio-temporal variability and instability of glacier flow on decadal scales; improve understanding of dynamic thickness change effects; allow estimating global calving fluxes; progress understanding of transport in glaciers and their role in landscape development; and help to better assess potentially hazardous glacier lakes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,395,320</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IDEA Heusler!"><Rcn>103027</Rcn><Nid>10333</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Inverse Design on an Atomic scale: Multifunctional Heusler compounds!</Name><PI>Claudia Anna Maria Felser</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Heusler compounds are a remarkable material, a vast collection of more than 1000 members with a large number of functionalities. The prototype Cu2MnAl is a ferromagnetic compound, even though none of its elemental constituents are magnetic. This is typical for this material class; the properties of many of the Heuslers can be forecast simply by counting the number of their valence electrons. Most of the Heusler compounds with 8, 18 or 24 valence electrons are semiconductors. The band gap can be tuned from more than 4 eV to zero by changing systematically the composition and simultaneously the lattice constant. Co2-Heusler compounds with more than 24 valence electrons are half-metallic ferromagnetic. Such compounds display nearly full spin polarized conduction electrons making them very useful for spintronics. Mn2-Heusler compounds show excellent performance for spin torque transfer applications. Another class of Heusler compounds has been predicted to be topological insulators, a new quantum state of matter. The precondition for my ambitious proposal was our systematic investigation of the Heusler family, which has led to detailed insight into the structure- electronic structure to property relation. The short term vision of this proposal is the design, synthesis and investigation of building blocks based on the Heusler structure with combined functionalities; such as superconducting topological insulators. With a virtual lab approach the materials with a desired property will be designed. The large number, the tuneability and controllability of the properties makes this material class the ideal system for the design of artificial multifunctional material on an atomic scale which allows contactless switchable functionalities via external control by fields, current, temperature, or other physical quantities. The long term vision is the synthesis of such an artificial material made by thin film or chemical methods for future electronics and energy technologies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,360,240</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IMAGINE"><Rcn>106987</Rcn><Nid>11619</Nid><HI>Forschungszentrum Julich Gmbh, Germany</HI><Name>Imaging Magnetism in Nanostructures using Electron Holography</Name><PI>Rafal Edward Dunin-Borkowski</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Future developments in the control, functionalization and manipulation of magnetic nanoparticles and nanoscale magnetic devices require an understanding of collinear and non-collinear spin configurations and correlated changes of electronic structure on the sub-nanometer scale.

In this project, an experimental methodology will be developed to allow magnetic spin structures in differently shaped nanomagnets to be visualized quantitatively and correlated with their crystallographic, compositional and defect structures. The project is based on the development of electron holography in the transmission electron microscope. It aims to provide quantitative measurements of internal magnetic fields in nanoparticles and devices that have characteristic dimensions of between 2 and 20 nm with a spatial resolution of better than 1 nm, both in projection and in three dimensions. Developments in instrumentation will allow the measurements to be acquired in situ in the electron microscope at elevated and reduced specimen temperatures and in the presence of oxidizing and reducing gases.

The project is highly interdisciplinary, requiring close collaboration between scientists working on nanoparticle synthesis, device fabrication, magnetic modeling, computational mathematics and characterization techniques. It will provide a powerful new analytical tool at the frontiers of the highest spatial resolution analysis of spin and electronic structures that will have far-reaching impact beyond a specific research domain, not only in fundamental magnetism but also for applications that include magnetic recording, spintronics, catalysis and biomedical applications of magnetic nanoparticles.

The methodology will also benefit European industry by providing a new leading edge in the fast growing international market of in situ transmission electron microscopy."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,140</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IMPUNEP"><Rcn>106613</Rcn><Nid>12905</Nid><HI>The University Of Sheffield, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Innovative Materials Processing Using Non-Equilibrium Plasmas</Name><PI>Allan Matthews</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Current bulk materials processing methods are nearing their limit in terms of ability to produce innovative materials with compositional and structural consistency.
The aim of this ambitious project is to remove barriers to materials development, by researching novel methods for the processing of engineering materials, using advanced non-equilibrium plasma systems, to achieve a paradigm shift in the field of materials synthesis. These new processes have the potential to overcome the constraints of existing methods and also be environmentally friendly and produce novel materials with enhanced properties (mechanical, chemical and physical).
The research will utilise plasmas in ways not used before (in bulk materials synthesis rather than thin film formation) and it will investigate different types of plasmas (vacuum, atmospheric and electrolytic), to ensure optimisation of the processing routes across the whole range of material types (including metals, ceramics and composites).
The materials synthesised will have benefits for products across key applications sectors, including energy, healthcare and aerospace. The processes will avoid harmful chemicals and will make optimum use of scarce material resources.
This interdisciplinary project (involving engineers, physicists, chemists and modellers) has fundamental &#226;&#128;&#156;blue skies&#226;&#128;&#157; and transformative aspects. It is also high-risk due to the aim to produce &#226;&#128;&#156;bulk&#226;&#128;&#157; materials at adequate rates and with consistent uniform structures, compositions and phases (and therefore properties) throughout the material. There are many challenges to overcome, relating to the study of the plasma systems and materials produced; these aspects will be pursued using empirical and modelling approaches. The research will pursue new lines of enquiry using an unconventional synthesis approach whilst operating at the interface with more established discipline areas of plasma physics, materials chemistry, process diagnostics, modelling and control."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,283</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INNOSTOCH"><Rcn>92146</Rcn><Nid>12692</Nid><HI>Universitetet I Oslo, Norway</HI><Name>INNOVATIONS IN STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS with emphasis on STOCHASTIC CONTROL AND INFORMATION</Name><PI>Bernt Karsten &#195;&#184;ksendal</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"For almost all kinds of dynamic systems modeling real processes in nature or society, most of the mathematical models we can formulate are - at best - inaccurate, and subject to random fluctuations and other types of ""noise"". Therefore it is important to be able to deal with such noisy models in a mathematically rigorous way. This rigorous theory is stochastic analysis. Theoretical progress in stochastic analysis will lead to new and improved applications in a wide range of fields.

The main purpose of this proposal is to establish a research environment which enhances the creation of new ideas and methods in the research of stochastic analysis and its applications. The emphasis is more on innovation, new models and challenges in the research frontiers, rather than small variations and minor improvements of already established theories and results. We will concentrate on applications in finance and biology, but the theoretical results may as well apply to several other areas.

Utilizing recent results and achievements by PI and a large group of distinguished coworkers, the natural extensions from the present knowledge is to concentrate on the mathematical theory of the interplay between stochastic analysis, stochastic control and information. More precisely, we have ambitions to make fundamental progress in the general theory of stochastic control of random systems and applications in finance and biology, and the explicit relation between the optimal performance and the amount of information available to the controller. Explicit examples of special interest include optimal control under partial or delayed information, and optimal control under inside or advanced information. A success of the present proposal will represent a substantial breakthrough, and in turn bring us a significant step forward in our attempts to understand various aspects of the world better, and it will help us to find optimal, sustainable ways to influence it."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,864,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INPAINTING"><Rcn>107045</Rcn><Nid>10892</Nid><HI>Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain</HI><Name>Inpainting Tools for Video Post-production: Variational theory and fast algorithms</Name><PI>Vicent Caselles Costa</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The goal of this project is the mathematical investigation of smoothness and self-similarity principles in generating natural images, the mathematical formulation and unification of both ideas in a variational form, and its application to develop models and algorithms for image processing tasks.
The proposed research will lead to the formulation and mathematical analysis of new variational principles for image and movie processing, the analysis of their underlying geometric measure theory and partial differential equations, unifying local and nonlocal approaches as respective mathematical expressions of the ideas of regularity and self-similarity.  Our research will be guided by a thorough investigation of the inpainting problem (including images, video and stereo video inpainting), as a very suitable model for testing the proposed ideas.
The first practical impact will be the development of models and algorithms for 2D and 3D image and video editing and manipulation, enabling the deletion and insertion of objects. As a second impact we will provide the theoretical background and implementation of a set of algorithms for 2D to 3D conversion of video data enabling the generation of 3D content for 3D TV from existing 2D video. Due to its fundamental nature, the proposed models may impact other image and video processing areas such as  denoising, restoration, optical flow computation, or stereo, that share similar challenges. Although their study is not in the scope of this project, it will be fostered by the dissemination of our results and the public release of our algorithms.
The PI has a long experience in the variational formulation of image processing problems, with key contributions in the variational formulations of edge detection and image inpainting, mathematical morphology, and the analysis of Total Variation based models. On the practical side, he has been contributing to the development of video post-production tools in several projects led by industry.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>515,055</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INPEC"><Rcn>106269</Rcn><Nid>10822</Nid><HI>Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitaet Bonn, Germany</HI><Name>Interacting Photon Bose-Einstein Condensates in Variable Potentials</Name><PI>Ernst Martin Weitz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Bose-Einstein condensation, the macroscopic ground state occupation of a system of bosonic particles below a critical temperature, has in the last two decades been observed in cold atomic gases and in solid-state physics quasiparticles. The perhaps most widely known example of a bosonic gas, photons in blackbody radiation, however exhibits no Bose-Einstein condensation, because the particle number is not conserved and at low temperatures the photons disappear in the system&#226;&#128;&#153;s walls instead of massively occupying the cavity ground mode. This is not the case in a small optical cavity, with a low-frequency cutoff imprinting a spectrum of photon energies restricted to well above the thermal energy. Using a microscopic cavity filled with dye solution at room temperature, my group has recently observed the first Bose-Einstein condensate of photons.

Building upon this work, the grant applicant here proposes to study the physics of interacting photon Bose-Einstein condensates in variable potentials. We will study the flow of the light condensate around external perturbations, and exploit signatures for superfluidity of the two-dimensional photon gas. Moreover, the condensate will be loaded into variable potentials induced by optical index changes, forming a periodic array of nanocavities. We plan to investigate the Mott insulating regime, and study thermal equilibrium population of more complex entangled manybody states for the photon gas. Other than in an ultracold atomic gas system, loading and cooling can proceed throughout the lattice manipulation time in our system. We expect to be able to directly condense into a macroscopic occupation of highly entangled quantum states. This is an issue not achievable in present atomic physics Bose-Einstein condensation experiments. In the course of the project, quantum manybody states, when constituting the system ground state, will be macroscopically populated in a thermal equilibrium process."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,133,560</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INSTABILITIES"><Rcn>111596</Rcn><Nid>12191</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Trento, Italy</HI><Name>Instabilities and nonlocal multiscale modelling of materials</Name><PI>Davide Bigoni</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Failure in ductile materials results from a multiscale interaction of discrete microstructures hierarchically emerging through subsequent material instabilities and self-organizing into regular patterns (shear band clusters, for instance). The targets of the project are: (i.) to disclose the failure mechanisms of materials through analysis of material instabilities and (ii.) to develop innovative microstructures to be embedded in solids, in order to open new possibilities in the design of ultra-resistant materials and structures.
The link between the two targets is that micromechanisms developing during failure inspire the way of enhancing the mechanical properties of materials by embedding microstructures. The aim is to provide design tools to obtain groundbreaking and unchallenged mechanical properties employing discrete microstructures, for instance to design a microstructure defining a material working under flutter condition.
The design of these microstructures will permit the achievement of innovative dynamical properties, defining elastic metamaterials, for instance, permitting the fabrication of flat lenses for elastic waves, evidencing negative refraction and superlensing effects. The objective is the discovery of these effects in mechanics, thus disclosing new horizons in the dynamics of materials.
Microstructures introduce length scales and nonlocal effects in the mechanical modelling, which involve the use of higher-order theories.
The analysis of these effects, usually developed within a phenomenological approach, will be attacked from the fundamental and almost unexplored point of view: the explicit evaluation of nonlocality, related to the microstructure via homogenisation theory."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,379,359</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INSYSBIO"><Rcn>93473</Rcn><Nid>9499</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Industrial Systems Biology of Yeast and A. oryzae</Name><PI>Jens Nielsen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Metabolic engineering is the development of new cell factories or improving existing ones, and it is the enabling science that allows for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals through biotechnology. With the development in genomics and functional genomics, it has become interesting to evaluate how advanced high-throughput experimental techniques (transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and fluxome) can be applied for improving the process of metabolic engineering. These techniques have mainly found applications in life sciences and studies of human health, and it is necessary to develop novel bioinformatics techniques and modelling concepts before they can provide physiological information that can be used to guide metabolic engineering strategies. In particular it is challenging how these techniques can be used to advance the use of mathematical modelling for description of the operation of complex metabolic networks. The availability of robust mathematical models will allow a wider use of mathematical models to drive metabolic engineering, in analogy with other fields of engineering where mathematical modelling is central in the design phase. In this project the advancement of novel concepts, models and technologies for enhancing metabolic engineering will be done in connection with the development of novel cell factories for high-level production of different classes of products.

Combustion produces 90 percent of the earth energy and will remain our first energy source for a long time. Optimizing combustors is a key issue to burn fossil and renewable fuels more efficiently but also to replace wind or solar energy production on days without sun or wind. This optimization cannot take place without numerical simulation (&#226;&#128;&#152;virtual combustors&#226;&#128;&#153;) that allows to test designs without building them. These virtual combustors cannot account for combustion instabilities (CI) which are a major risk in combustors where they induce vibration, loss of control and destruction. CIs cannot be predicted reliably today.  INTECOCIS aims at introducing recent progress in High Performance Computing (HPC) into studies of CIs, to build simulation tools running on massively parallel computers that can predict CIs in future combustors and assess methods to control them. To achieve this goal, the simulations used today for CIs will be revolutionized to integrate recent HPC capacities and have the capabilities and brute power required to compute and control CI phenomena. A second objective of INTECOCIS is to distribute these HPC-based tools in Europe. These tools will integrate UQ (uncertainty quantification) methodologies to quantify the uncertainties associated with the simulations because CIs are sensitive to small changes in geometry, fuel composition or boundary conditions. Moreover, simulation tools also contain uncertain parameters (numerical methods, space and time discretization, impedances, physical sub models) that will have to be investigated as well. Most of the work will be theoretical and numerical but INTECOCIS will also include validation on laboratory burners (at IMFT and other laboratories in Europe) as well as applications on real combustors for European companies collaborating with IMFT and CERFACS."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,488,656</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INTEGRAL"><Rcn>185449</Rcn><Nid>11962</Nid><HI>Stockholms Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Integrable Systems in Gauge and String Theory</Name><PI>Konstantin Zarembo</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The project is aimed at uncovering new links between integrable systems, string theory and quantum field theory.

Contemporary examples with inherent challenges to be overcome are the design of ultrahigh specific strength materials. There is a critical need for successful developments in this area in particular for reduced energy consumption, reduction of pollutant emissions and passenger safety. Alternative approaches include improved thermal stability and creep resistance of high-temperature alloys for energy conversion, which are generally used in power plants and turbine engines, high temperature process technology, and fossil-fuel driven engines. The ageing European society makes biomedical materials for implant and stent design also crucially important. A drawback of nearly all current high strength metallic materials is that they lack ductility (i.e. are brittle and hard to form)- or on the opposite side, they may be highly ductile but lack strength. The key concept behind INTELHYB is to define new routes for creation of tailored metallic materials based on scale-bridging intelligent hybrid structures enabling property as well as function optimization. The novelty of this proposal as compared to conventional ideas is that they apply to monolithic amorphous materials or bulk microcrystalline. The basis will be founded on innovative strategies for the design, synthesis and characterization of intrinsic length-scale modulation and phase transformation under highly non-equilibrium conditions. This will include the incorporation of dispersed phases which are close to or beyond their thermodynamic and mechanical stability limit thus forming a hierarchically structured hybrid and ductile/tough alloys. Alternatively, the material itself will be designed in a manner such that it is at the verge of its thermodynamic/mechanical stability.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,920</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="INTERCOCOS"><Rcn>99135</Rcn><Nid>8943</Nid><HI>Max Planck Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Wissenschaften E.v., Germany</HI><Name>Interdisciplinary research: Connecting complex plasmas with colloidal dispersions</Name><PI>Gregor Eugen Morfill</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal represents the first concerted effort to study classical strongly coupled systems at the most fundamental individual-particle level, by using complementary approaches from different physics domains - complex plasmas and colloidal dispersions. These are complementary in many ways, the most important being that complex plasmas are virtually undamped at the particle timescales, whereas colloidal dispersions are overdamped and thus can be brought into equilibrium in a controlled way. Otherwise, both fields have similar advantages: Fully resolved 3D particle trajectories can easily be visualized, the pair interactions are tunable, and particles can be manipulated individually or collectively.

In contrast, our methods of making complex organic molecules have taken us far away from the watery milieu of biosynthesis. Indeed, it is fair to say that most organic reactions commonly used both in academic laboratories and in industry fail in the presence of water or oxygen. At the same time of course, chemical reactors are very different from the cellular environment where Nature s synthesis is carried out. This research proposal aims to incorporate some of the key characteristic of cellular reactors, i.e. confinement, compartmentalization and interfaces, into model droplet-based reactors. The envisioned reactors will comprise of monodisperse aqueous droplets in oil carrier phases with volumes ranging from pL to nL, produced in microfluidics devices or in tubing, in very large numbers. These droplets will have precisely determined interfacial areas, which can be used for the study of so-called on water reactions, a new area of synthetic chemistry rapidly gaining in interest. Furthermore, the interfaces can be functionalized with catalytically active surfactants and by confining the droplets into ever decreasing volumes, the effect of nanoconfinement on enzymatic and other reactions can be studied. Finally, individual droplets provide a completely compartmentalized environment, suitable for the study of single enzymes in a crowded environment, but also for systematic studies into communication between compartmentalized, mutually incompatible, reaction systems.

In EDLCs, the charges are stored electrostatically at the electrolyte / electrode interface, which confers them high power and cycling capabilities. Until recently, it was believed that charge storage in porous carbon EDLC electrodes could be achieved only if the pore size of the carbon was larger than the electrolyte ions with their solvation shells. Using Carbides Derived Carbons (CDCs) which have controlled pore sizes between 0.6 nm and 1.1 nm, we recently demonstrated that high capacitive performances could be obtained when the pore size is smaller than the solvated ion size.
The origin of this capacitance increase is still unclear despite important modelling efforts achieved by many research groups. Using our fine-tuned, controlled pore size CDCs carbons with narrow pore size distribution, we propose here an integrated approach combining the use of experimental electrochemical methods (EQCM, EIS, CV&#226;&#128;&#166;) and in-situ analytical techniques (NMR, XRD), to computational modelling (Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo and Reverse Monte Carlo methods) to elucidate the ion transport and adsorption mechanisms inside nanopores.
A direct application of this fundamental approach concerns the energy storage with supercapacitors. Thanks to the unique features offered by the CDCs, we propose to develop the next generation of high-energy density micro-supercapacitors from bulk CDC films.
The evidence of the increase of the capacitive ion adsorption associated with ion partial desolvation in micropores is also of great interest in different areas such as water desalination. CDCs, which have demonstrated volumetric capacitance improvement of 100% compared to activated carbon for supercapacitor application, are appealing materials for water desalination applications, which will be the last part of the project."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,494,050</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IRQUAT"><Rcn>98745</Rcn><Nid>11857</Nid><HI>Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Spain</HI><Name>Information and Randomness in Quantum Theory</Name><PI>Andreas Winter</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Quantum information science is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of science today, its significance ranging from the ultimate physical limits of information processing, to fundamental issues of quantum mechanics, to new mathematics and prospects of realising novel, enhanced computation and communication

Drawing on ideas from physics, mathematics and computer science, one of the core programmes of this highly interdisciplinary field is to understand and harness quantum mechanics in terms of information theory.
Past steps in this programme include Shor's quantum factoring algorithm, quantum cryptography, and the creation of quantum Shannon and entanglement theory. Dramatic recent developments, while opening up exciting new avenues, at the same time pose major challenges: the proof that quantum capacities can be non-additive showed that the landscape of quantum Shannon theory is actually much richer than previously envisaged; the information theory of generalized non-locality pointed out a completely new take on the foundations of quantum mechanics; and mathematical tools such as the probabilistic method have had a major impact across the board from entanglement theory to quantum Shannon theory and statistical mechanics.
In the proposed research I will address key current open questions in quantum Shannon theory, including long-standing coding problems, and a deeper understanding of the pervasive non-additivity of quantum capacities; develop probabilistic tools directly related to quantum information; find new entropy inequalities and entropic uncertainty relations; characterise entanglement and non-local correlations in information theoretic terms; and realise an ambitious programme of founding statistical mechanics on generic quantum dynamics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,440,119</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ISONEB"><Rcn>109154</Rcn><Nid>9484</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Isotopic records of solar nebula evolution and controls on planetary compositions</Name><PI>Timothy Elliott</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project has three linked strands that will combine to constrain the birth environment of the solar system and the nebular processes that shape bulk planetary compositions.

The key question being addressed is: how can the powerful concepts of high-index-contrast nanophotonics be combined with the extreme accuracy of silicon technology and with the performance of hybrid silicon/III-V integration in order to create system-on-chip functionalities for advanced (bio-)spectroscopy.
We will first focus research on integrated lasers or Laser Systems-on-Chip (LaSOC&#226;&#128;&#153;s) capable of providing very wide wavelength tuning in the infrared, mid-infrared or visible. These lasers will have an unprecedented combination of properties. They will differ from existing semiconductor lasers in the sense that they combine the best of III-V semiconductor technology and silicon technology in unique cavity structures exploiting high index contrast in three dimensions.
In the second phase of the project we will shift the focus from laser-oriented novelty to spectroscopy-oriented novelty and investigate SpecSOC&#226;&#128;&#153;s with an unprecedented system performance that matches the requirements of mainstream real-life spectroscopy. We will explore coherent optical detection techniques for sensitivity enhancement, microporous coatings for on-chip gas sensing and implant-oriented tissue spectroscopy.
Our research will lead to a paradigm shift in laser spectroscopy, in the sense that it will turn an advanced spectroscopy system into a small form-factor commodity system. This will have an enormous impact on applications such as point-of-care medical diagnosis and medical implants, monitoring of air, water and food quality. Furthermore the on-chip spectroscopy systems will be highly valuable for fundamental research.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,183,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InfiniteBayesian"><Rcn>106289</Rcn><Nid>11187</Nid><HI>Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>Bayesian Statistics in Infinite Dimensions: Targeting Priors by Mathematical Analysis</Name><PI>Adrianus Willem Van Der Vaart</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>I propose novel methods for understanding key aspects that are essential
to the future of Bayesian inference for high- or infinite-dimensional
models and data.  By combining my expertise on empirical processes and
likelihood theory with my recent work on posterior contraction I shall
foremost lay a mathematical foundation for the Bayesian solution to
uncertainty quantification in high dimensions.

Decades of doubt that Bayesian methods can work for high-dimensional
models or data have in the last decade been replaced by a belief that
these methods are actually especially appropriate in this
setting. They are thought to possess greater capacity for
incorporating prior knowledge and to be better able to combine data
from related measurements. My premise is that for high- or
infinite-dimensional models and data this belief is not well founded,
and needs to be challenged and shaped by mathematical analysis.

My central focus is the accuracy of the posterior distribution as
quantification of uncertainty. This is unclear and has hardly been
studied, notwithstanding that it is at the core of the Bayesian
method. In fact the scarce available evidence on Bayesian credible
sets in high dimensions (sets of prescribed posterior probability)
casts doubt on their ability to capture a given truth. I shall discover
how this depends strongly on the prior distribution, empirical or
hierarchical Bayesian tuning, and posterior marginalizaton, and therewith
generate guidelines for good practice.

I shall study these issues in novel statistical settings (sparsity and
large scale inference, inverse problems, state space models,
hierarchical modelling), and connect to the most recent, exciting
developments in general statistics.

I work against a background of data-analysis in genetics, genomics,
finance, and imaging, and employ stochastic process theory,
mathematical analysis and information theory.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,190,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Interface"><Rcn>104178</Rcn><Nid>9807</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Quantum Optical Interfaces for Atoms and Nano-electro-mechanical Systems</Name><PI>Eugene Polzik</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Quantum interfaces capable of transferring quantum states and generating entanglement between fields and matter are set to play a growing role in the development of science and technology. Development of such interfaces has been a crucial component in quantum information processing and communication. In the past decade quantum interfaces between atoms and optical photons have been extensively explored by a number of leading groups. Quantum state transfer between light and atoms, such as quantum memory and quantum teleportation, entanglement of massive objects, as well as measurements and sensing beyond standard quantum limits have been demonstrated by the group of the PI.

We propose to develop a robust, integrated and scalable atom-light interface and to incorporate it into a hybrid multi-facet quantum network with other relevant quantum systems, such as nano-mechanical oscillators and electronic circuits.

Towards this ambitious goal we will develop room temperature atomic quantum memories in spin protecting micro-cells (mu-cells) and opto-mechanical and electromechanical strongly coupled systems. Interfacing atoms, electronic circuits and nano-mechanical oscillators we will perform ultrasensitive quantum limited field and force measurements and quantum teleportation of states across the range of these systems.

In the fundamental sense, this research program will further broaden the horizons of quantum physics and quantum information processing by expanding it into new and unexplored macroscopic domains.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Intersolar"><Rcn>101764</Rcn><Nid>11929</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rectifying interfaces for solar driven fuel synthesis</Name><PI>James Robert Durrant</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>There is rapidly growing interest in the science required to enable the conversion of solar energy into molecular fuels, motivated both by the need to develop a renewable, globally scalable transportation fuel strategy and the need to address the intermittency limitations of solar electrical power generation. Rapid progress is being made in the fabrication of inorganic, low cost, nanostructured photoelectrodes which utilise visible irradiation for such fuel syntheses, including water photolysis and CO2 photoreduction. However the efficiency of low cost photoelectrodes remains modest, due significantly to electron / hole recombination in the photoelectrode competing effectively with interfacial photochemistry. I propose to address this limitation by the use of multilayer interfaces designed to achieve enhanced uni-directional (i.e.: rectifying) charge separation, building directly from the extensive lessons I have learnt from my studies addressing an analogous challenge in dye sensitized solar cells. A key focus will be on the functionalisation of photoelectrodes with molecular and/or inorganic multi-electron catalysts to enhance the specificity and efficiency of the photoelectrode for fuel synthesis, exploiting recent, rapid advances in the syntheses of such catalysts. The use of rectifying interfaces is essential for the encorporation of such catalysts onto photoelectrodes, enabling the accumulation of multiple oxidations on the catalyst without this accumulation resulting in enhanced recombination losses. The proposal will undertake the assembly of such multilayer photoelectrodes, utlilising state of the art photoelectrode and catalyst materials, and the functional characterisation of these photoelectrodes, including measurement of interfacial electron transfer dynamics, with the aim of developing materials design rules which will enable systematic optimisation of photoelectrode function for efficient solar driven fuel synthesis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,800,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InvProb"><Rcn>97879</Rcn><Nid>9027</Nid><HI>Tallinna Tehnikaulikool, Estonia</HI><Name>Inverse Problems</Name><PI>Lassi Juhani P&#195;&#164;iv&#195;&#164;rinta</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Inverse problems constitute an interdisciplinary field of science concentrating on the mathematical theory and practical interpretation of indirect measurements. Their applications include medical imaging, atmospheric remote sensing, industrial process monitoring, and astronomical imaging. The common feature is extreme sensitivity to measurement noise. Computerized tomography, MRI, and exploration of the interior of earth by using earthquake data are typical inverse problems where mathematics has played an important role. By using the methods of inverse problems it is possible to bring modern mathematics to a vast number of applied fields. Genuine scientific innovations that are found in mathematical research, say in geometry, stochastics, or analysis, can be brought to real life applications through modelling. The solutions are often found by combining recent theoretical and computational advances. The study of inverse problems is one of the most active and fastest growing areas of modern applied mathematics, and the most interdisciplinary field of mathematics or even science in general.
The exciting but high risk problems in the research plan of the PI include mathematics of invisibility cloaking, invisible patterns, practical algorithms for imaging, and random quantum systems. Progress in these problems could have a considerable impact in applications such as construction of metamaterials for invisible optic fibre cables, scopes for MRI devices, and early screening for breast cancer. The progress here necessitates international collaboration. This will be realized in upcoming programs on inverse problems.

Automatic classification and retrieval is strongly needed to analyze and access these massive data sets, but current algorithms often produce too many errors. For high-dimensional signals, supervised classification algorithms are typically applied to reduced ``feature vectors''. These feature representations are specialized for each signal modality, for example speech, music, images, videos or seismic signals.  This proposal aims at unifying these approaches to improve classification performances, by developing a general mathematical and algorithmic framework to optimize representations for classification. Classification errors result from representations which are not sufficiently informative or which maintain too much variability. The central challenge is to understand how to construct stable, informative invariants, while facing progressively more complex sources of variability. The first task concentrates on invariants to the action of finite groups including translations, rotations and scalings, while preserving stability to deformations. The second task addresses unsupervised representation learning from training data. The third task explores stable representations of invariant geometric signal structures, which is an outstanding problem.These challenges involve building new mathematical tools in harmonic and wavelet analysis, geometry and statistics, in close interaction with numerical algorithms. Classification applications to audio, images, video signals or geophysical signals are expected to serve as a basis for groundbreaking technological advances.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,316,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="KetenCycls"><Rcn>98067</Rcn><Nid>11867</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Biomimetic Late Stage Aromatisation Reactions: from Cancer Chemotherapy to Novel Polymers</Name><PI>Anthony Gerard Martin Barrett</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The applicant is seeking funding to support research on late stage biomimetic syntheses of resorcylates from readily available non-aromatic precursors. A series of diketo-dioxinones will be synthesised using mild Claisen condensation reactions and converted into the reactive intermediates triacyl-ketenes by retro-Diels Alder reactions. These will be trapped with alcohols to directly provide the corresponding resorcylate esters and related macrocyclic lactones. These compounds are of considerable importance in that they occur in structurally complex natural products, which are active as anticancer agents, antibiotics, immunosuppressants or analgesics. Examples include aigialomycin D, radicicol, cruentaren A and mycophenolic acid. Late aromatisation avoids the severe problems associated with existing syntheses based on aromatic precursors. Our studies will allow for the development of very concise total syntheses of the biologically potent Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol and mitochondrial F-ATPase inhibitor cruentaren A. The methods will be amenable for the synthesis of libraries of synthetic natural product analogues in the quest for superior drugs to treat cancer. The novel ring opening, ring closing and crossed metathesis of cyclooctyne derivatives will be introduced and will simplify the route to cruentaren A. Resorcylate methodology will be extended to terpenoid-resorcylates, using a new decarboxylative allyl transfer process, which will greatly simplify routes to angelicoin A, cristatic acid, mycophenolic acid and hongoquercin B. Finally, both the aromatisation strategy and ring opening metathesis polymerisation of cyclooctyne derivatives will be applied in the synthesis of novel oligomers and polymers including polyfunctional polyesters and poly-ynes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,960,938</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LASER-IMS"><Rcn>107823</Rcn><Nid>12875</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Coupling laser spectroscopy to mass spectrometry and ion mobility: from fundamentals to analytical sciences</Name><PI>Philippe Dugourd</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The motivations for studying the gaseous structures of peptides and proteins range from developing efficient methodologies for protein identification and quantification to fundamental understanding of folding processes and biomolecular architectures. Mass spectrometry allows analyzing biomolecular ions in a variety of different forms, for example, as a function of charge state, bound to their targets or in multimers following aggregation. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry is a revolutionary technique regarding the separation of complex mixtures and structural isomers and can now play an important role in the study of protein shapes and their complexes. In parallel, optical spectroscopy is also emerging as a key element in gas phase methods available for investigating biomolecular ions. In this proposal, we want to combine spectroscopic approaches with high resolution mass spectrometry and ion mobility to widen and deepen the scope of mass spectrometry in its various fields of applications including structural biology, protein identification and quantification. The general idea behind our approach is to simultaneously obtain &#226;&#128;&#156;orthogonal&#226;&#128;&#157; information on gas phase molecular conformation from ion mobility and optical spectroscopy, with in addition the possibility of using light to induce conformational changes or the formation of new species.

Moreover, fundamental understanding of structure and reactivity of peptides and proteins will serve as a lever for the development of applications in analytical sciences using photon based dissociation.

In LAYERENG-HYBMAT I propose a fundamentally new category of nanocomposite materials, that is, layer-by-layer grown coherent inorganic-organic hybrid materials where the cohesion between the layers is based on covalent bonding. Such materials are &#226;&#128;&#147; once carefully designed and fabricated &#226;&#128;&#147; able to display in a single material a tailored combination of properties of conventional inorganics and organics, and even beyond. The core hypothesis is that such intimately fused outstanding hybrids are materialized in a simple but extremely elegant manner by mimicking the state-of-the-art thin-film technology, i.e. ALD (atomic layer deposition), originally developed for purely inorganic thin films. The proposed method combines ALD and MLD (molecular layer deposition) cycles and enables the layer-by-layer deposition of coherent inorganic-organic thin films and coatings through sequential self-limiting gas-surface reactions with high precision for the composition and polymer-chain dispersity. With additional nanostructuring capacity these materials have the potential to open up new horizons in electronics, photonics, thermoelectrics, diagnostics, packaging, etc.
The project builds on my long experience in frontier new-material research on other types of multilayered materials and successful proof-of-the-concept ALD/MLD experiments, and addresses all the fundamental aspects of new-material design, modelling, precision synthesis, property tailoring and function characterization."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,358,102</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LCC"><Rcn>103380</Rcn><Nid>12757</Nid><HI>Aarhus Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Coupled Cluster Calculations on Large Molecular Systems</Name><PI>Poul J&#195;&#184;rgensen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Quantum mechanics provides the key to the understanding of the molecular world. Many years of theoretical research have made coupled cluster calculations the state-of-the-art method for small molecules, where calculations have reached an accuracy often challenging experimental results. To describe large molecular systems with coupled cluster methods, the computational scaling with the system size of existing methods represents a roadblock to progress. The ultimate goal is to obtain coupled cluster methods that scale linearly with system size and where the calculations are embarrassingly parallel, such that calculations for small and large molecular systems require the same computational wall time. This proposal describes how this goal may be accomplished. The key is to express the coupled cluster wave function in a basis of local Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals. We have recently shown how such a local HF basis may be obtained and described how linear-scaling, embarrassingly parallel coupled cluster energies may be obtained. Here we present proof-of-concept calculations for the energy and the molecular gradient for the simple model MP2 (second order M&#195;&#184;ller-Plesset perturbation theory) and propose to use the same technology for higher level coupled cluster methods to yield not only the energy of a large molecule, but also molecular properties as the equilibrium geometry, harmonic frequencies, excitation energies and transition moments, nuclear shieldings, polarizabilities and electronic and vibrational circular dichroism. This proposal will open a new era of accurate quantum calculations on large molecular systems such as nanoparticles and proteins.

As masses move, for instance like the two components in a binary system, ripples in space-time are created that propagate through the Universe, very much like waves caused by a stone falling into a pond. These ``gravitational waves'' (GWs) are known to exist from the effect that they have on a system of two orbiting stars. After inferring their existence indirectly, the next great challenge is the {\em direct} detection of GWs. While this is the aim of a number of gravitational wave detectors around the world, a detection has not been made.  Fortunately, a method exists that allows us today to detect GWs directly, in a frequency range that is much lower but complementary to those covered by ground-based detectors. This method utilises the radio astronomical observations of a special type of star known as radio pulsars.  We propose an experiment to achieve the ground-breaking goal of GW detection with the help of an innovative approach.  At the heart of this approach, named LEAP, lies the goal to combine the collective power of Europe's biggest radio-telescopes to form the biggest fully-steerable telescope on Earth, providing a ``leap'' in our sensitivity to go beyond the threshold that delivers the first direct detection of GWs. While the rewards for a successful detection of GWs are immense, we demonstrate that this is possible by harvesting the experience and resources uniquely available in Europe."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,455,285</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LEARN"><Rcn>97565</Rcn><Nid>12772</Nid><HI>Linkopings Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Limitations, Estimation, Adaptivity, Reinforcement and Networks in System Identification</Name><PI>Lennart Ljung</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The objective with this proposal is to provide design tools and algorithms for model management in robust, adaptive and  autonomous engineering systems. The increasing demands on reliable models for systems of ever greater complexity have pointed to several insufficiencies in today's techniques for model construction. The proposal addresses key areas where new ideas are required. Modeling a central issue in many scientific fields. System Identification is the term used in the Automatic Control Community for the area of building mathematical models of dynamical systems from observed input and output signals, but several other research communities work with the same problem under different names, such as (data-driven) learning.

We have identified   five specific themes where progress is both acutely needed and feasible:
1.	Encounters with Convex Programming Techniques: How to capitalize on the remarkable recent progress in convex and semidefinite programming to obtain efficient, robust and reliable algorithmic solutions.
2.	Fundamental Limitations:  To develop and elucidate what are the limits of model accuracy, regardless of the modeling method. This can be seen as a theory rooted in the Cramer-Rao inequality in the spirit of invariance results and lower bounds characterizing, e.g., Information Theory.
3.	Experiment Design and Reinforcement Techniques: Study how well tailored and ``cheap'' experiments can extract essential information about isolated model properties. Also study how such methods may relate to general reinforcement techniques.
4.	Potentials of Non-parametric Models: How to incorporate and adjust techniques from adjacent research communities, e.g. concerning manifold learning and Gaussian Processes in machine learning.
5.	Managing Structural Constraints: To develop structure preserving identification methods for networked and decentralized systems.

We have ideas how to approach each of these themes, and initial attempts are promising.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LHCtheory"><Rcn>102024</Rcn><Nid>10431</Nid><HI>European Organization For Nuclear Research, Switzerland</HI><Name>Theoretical predictions and analyses of LHC physics: advancing the precision frontier</Name><PI>Michelangelo Mangano</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The primary goal of this research proposal is to push to new levels of precision the predictive power of theoretical analyses of the phenomena observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The start-up of the LHC has opened a new era in the exploration of the fundamental laws of Nature. This is expected to lead, among other results, to the clarification of the mechanism breaking the electroweak symmetry of fundamental interactions, to the discovery of new elementary particles, possibly accounting for the Dark Matter seen in the cosmos, and to the observation of new interactions, acting differently on matter and antimatter, to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.
The crucial ingredient in the success of this ambitious programme is the ability to interpret the signals extracted by the experiments.  To decode their properties and match them to the dynamics of possible new physics models relies on the numerical simulation of such dynamics, and on the ability to distinguish it from that of the known Standard Model (SM) processes. The past two decades have witnessed a continuous progress in this field, driven by the exploitation of the data from previous colliders, such as LEP, HERA and the Tevatron. The complexity of the LHC final states, the large rates of processes with many jets and their role in mimicking the production and decay of possible new particles, call for an aggressive effort to radically improve the current quality and accuracy of the theoretical modelling, to match the unprecedented discovery potential and measurement precision of the LHC experiments.

Lithium ion batteries (LIBs). New positive and negative electrode materials are required for a range of LIB applications, which are lighter, have higher capacities, and can be operated at higher rates. To this end, I will establish a joint synthesis and characterization program, aimed at understanding how LIB-materials function and sometimes fail, in order to provide the fundamental insight required to design the next generation of LIBs. In particular we will use NMR spectroscopy, with other relevant characterization tools, including pair distribution function analysis, to investigate structure and Li dynamics. The specific objectives are (i) to develop novel in situ NMR techniques to investigate LIBs under realistic operating conditions, including the very high rates required for batteries for transportation. (ii) Utilize these methodologies to investigate a wide range of electrode systems, including conversion reactions, doped phosphates and composite electrodes. 2. Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. This smaller program will investigate both oxygen and proton transport in ceramic materials, focusing on doped perovskites. Identification of the differences between the local structures of the ions that contribute to the ionic conductivity, and those that remain trapped in the lattice, represents a challenge for many experimental structural probes. Our objectives are to use NMR techniques to determine local structure and motion, in order to identify (i) how doping controls structure and (ii) the conduction mechanisms responsible for ionic conductivity.

The first survey will target the fifty most massive strong lensing galaxy clusters and will shade new lights: i) on the nature of the Dark Matter through constraints coming from: the detailed mass distribution, the importance of substructures, and possible measurement of Dark Matter particle decay or self-annihilation, ii) on the most distant galaxies and the identification of the nature of the sources participating in the cosmic-reionization and ending the Dark Ages, iii) on the nature of the Dark Energy, through the accurate modeling of numerous multiple images in the best lensing clusters.
Second, with wide field imaging and spectroscopic surveys of the galaxy distribution we will probe new cosmological tests: i) the combination of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering in the framework of the halo model, ii) the measurement of the angle distribution of galaxy pairs, and thanks to the huge volume probed by the BOSS survey, iii) the test of the isotropy principle at various location of the surveyed volume. Finally we will prepare for the next generation of cosmological surveys by conducting an emission line galaxies redshift survey (e-BOSS) similar as those planned by the future facilities such as BigBOSS and EUCLID.
The LIDA project can started now, and will benefit from: new data collected by both space and ground-based telescopes over the next five years, as well as an active and vibrant work location in one of the best ranked university in Europe."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,935</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LILO"><Rcn>97218</Rcn><Nid>11786</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>Light-In, Light-Out: Chemistry for sustainable energy technologies</Name><PI>Edwin Charles Constable</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The project is concerned with a coordinated approach to the development of of novel chemical strategies for light harvesting by photovoltaic cells and light generation using light emitting electrochemical cells. Both technologies have proof of principle results from the PIs own laboratory and others world-wide. The bulk of efficient dye sensitized solar cells rely on transition metal complexes as the photoactive component as the majority of traditional organic dyes do not possess long term stability under the operating conditions of the devices. LECs based upon transition metal complexes have been shown to possess lifetimes sufficiently long and efficiencies sufficiently high to become a viable alternative technology to OLEDs in the near future. The disadvantages of state of the art devices for both technologies is that they are based upon second or third row transition metal complexes. Although these elements are expensive, the principle difficulties arise from their low abundance, which creates significant issues of sustainability if the technology is to be adopted. The aim of this project is three-fold. Firstly, to further optimise the individual technologies using conventional transition metal complexes, with increases in efficiency leading to lower metal requirements. Secondly, to explore the periodic table for metal-containing luminophores based on first row transition metals, with an emphasis upon copper and zinc containing species. The final aspect is related to the utilization of solar derived electrons for water splitting reactions, allowing the generation of hydrogen and/or reaction products of hydrogen with organic species. This latter aspect is related to the mid-term requirement for liquid fuels, regardless of the primary fuel sources utilized. The program will involve design and synthesis of new materials, device construction and evaluation (in-house and with existing academic and industrial partners) and iterative refinement of structures</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,399,440</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LIQAD"><Rcn>98082</Rcn><Nid>12470</Nid><HI>Universitaet Stuttgart, Germany</HI><Name>Long-range interacting quantum systems and devices</Name><PI>Tilman Pfau</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Controlled correlations in a quantum network are at the heart of emerging quantum technologies for communication, information processing and computation. The scaling to a large number of interconnected nodes has so far remained an open challenge. Here mesoscopic ensembles of atoms which can be well controlled in their geometry and which provide rapidly switchable long range interactions promise an alternative approach with a significant simplification for quantum devices and networks. Finite temperatures up to even above room temperature operation of the resulting quantum devices might be possible and the upscaling to quantum networks with millions of nodes seems within reach.
Therefore I propose to study Rydberg interacting mesoscopic ensembles at low and high temperatures. In the first part fundamental building blocks for quantum devices and networks based on the so called Rydberg blockade in mesoscopic ensembles will be studied in an ultracold environment. In the second part I will investigate how to transfer these ideas to scalable ensembles in thermal micro-vapor cells. As the range of interaction can be on the order of micrometers, standard techniques in lithography can be used to produce mesoscopic ensembles confined in glass cells. Display fabrication technologies used for the production of TFT LC (thin-film transistor liquid crystal) displays can be used to scale the number of connected mesoscopic ensembles up dramatically. I will investigate to what extend the interdisciplinary combination of micro- and display technology and atomic physics enables the parallel operation of many scalable single photon sources for example to feed a large linear optical quantum network. This resulting ground-breaking perspective for the applicability of quantum devices and networks justifies the risk to explore fundamentally and technologically unexplored territory."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,407,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LOFAR-AUGER"><Rcn>89101</Rcn><Nid>11690</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>From Black Holes to Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays: Exploring the Extremes of the Universe with Low-Frequency Radio Interferometry</Name><PI>Heino Falcke</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Black holes (BHs) and ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are two extremes of the universe that link particle physics and astrophysics. BHs are the most efficient power generators in the universe while UHECRs are the most energetic particles ever detected. As we showed previously, a major fraction of the power of BHs is channeled into radio-emitting plasma jets, which are also efficient particle accelerators. Are BHs also responsible for UHECRs? This long-standing question could be answered soon, through the dawn of cosmic ray astronomy. The giant Auger observatory has now shown for the first time that the arrival directions of UHECRs are non-isotropic, potentially pointing back to their sources of origin. BHs turned out to be major suspects, but other sources could still also be responsible. To address this conclusively and to establish cosmic ray astronomy as a productive new field in the coming years, we need to increase statistics, expand current observatories, and have complementary all-sky radio surveys available to identify sources, since radio emission traces particle acceleration sites. Here, techniques pioneered by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) promise major advances. First of all, working on LOFAR we uncovered a new technique to detect UHECRs with radio antennas and verified it experimentally. The technique promises to increase the number of high-quality events by almost an order of magnitude and provides much improved energy and direction resolution. We now want to implement this technique in Auger, combining LOFAR and AUGER know-how. Secondly, LOFAR and soon other SKA pathfinders will significantly improve all-sky radio surveys with high sensitivity, resolution, and image quality. Hence, we will use LOFAR to understand the astrophysics of UHECR source candidates and compile a radio-based catalog thereof. We start with jets from BHs and move later to other sources. Together this will allow us to identify UHECR sources and study them in detail."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,460,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LOFARCORE"><Rcn>185414</Rcn><Nid>12361</Nid><HI>Stichting Astron, Netherlands Institute For Radio Astronomy, Netherlands</HI><Name>Unravelling the Cosmic Reionization History</Name><PI>Antonius Gerardus De Bruyn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"One of the frontier cosmological research themes of the past decade has been the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This era marked the start of the formation of visible baryonic structures: stars, (dwarf-)galaxies, clusters and the cosmic web. Some top level questions surrounding COsmic REionization are: ""When did it start ?&#226;&#128;&#157;, &#226;&#128;&#156;How long did it take ?&#226;&#128;&#157;, &#226;&#128;&#156;What were the main ionizing sources ?&#226;&#128;&#157;, and &#226;&#128;&#156;What did the Universe look like during this crucial evolutionary phase ?""  Simulations of reionization suggest how it may have proceeded, but hard observational facts on the EoR are few and far between.
At the start of the EoR all hydrogen was cold and neutral. At redshift z=6 the transition to an ionized Universe was completed. The 21cm line, redshifted to much longer wavelength, is a key diagnostic during this phase. LOFAR, the European LOw Frequency Array, will be the premier instrument to explore this epoch, simultaneously over the full redshift range from z=6.5-11.5 ! The required angular resolution is also well matched to the 2.5 km CORE of LOFAR.  Detecting redshifted HI from the EoR is generally acknowledged as the most difficult radio astronomical project ever attempted. As PI of the LOFAR EoR Key Science Project and as LOFAR Calibration Project scientist, I have worked hard for 10 years to prepare LOFAR and myself for this endeavour.
In November 2012 LOFAR commenced a long (&gt; 3-5 years) observing campaign, generating several PB of data per year.  A new phase, with extraordinary challenges, still lies ahead. ERC funding for the LOFARCORE team will permit me to ramp up the execution of this program, and  in a timely manner (we have competition from US, Australian and Indian groups), solve problems along the way, and analyze and publish what will be ground-breaking results on the COsmic REionization history. The LOFAR EoR project will be the pathfinder for even more daunting future explorations, using SKA, of the phases preceeding the EoR, i.e. Cosmic Dawn."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,348,468</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LTDBud"><Rcn>101487</Rcn><Nid>10466</Nid><HI>Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia Renyi Alfred Matematikai Kutatointezet, Hungary</HI><Name>Low Dimensional Topology in Budapest</Name><PI>Andras Istvan Stipsicz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Heegaard Floer theory.  In this project (in collaboration with P. Ozsv&#195;&#161;th and Z.

We also plan to find combinatorial definitions of these invariants (as graded groups). Such results will potentially lead to a combinatorial description of 4-dimensional Heegaard Floer (mixed) invariants, conjecturally equivalent to Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth 4-manifolds. In particular, we hope to find a combinatorial proof of Donaldson&#226;&#128;&#153;s diagonalizability theorem, and find relations between the Heegaard Floer and the fundamental groups of a 3-manifold.

Contact topology. Using Heegaard Floer theory and contact surgery, a systematic study of existence of tight contact structures on 3-manifolds is planned. Similar techniques also apply in studying Legendrian and transverse knots in contact 3-manifolds. In particular, the verification of the existence of tight structures on 3-manifolds given by surgery on a knot (with high enough framing) in the 3-sphere is proposed. Using the Legendrian invariant of knots, Legendrian and transverse simplicity can be conveniently studied. The ideas detailed in this part are planned to be carried out partly in collaboration with Paolo Lisca, Vera V&#195;&#169;rtesi and Hansj&#195;&#182;rg Geiges.

Exotic 4-manifolds. Extending our previous results, we plan to investigate the existence of exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with small Euler characteristics, such as the complex projective plane CP2, its blow-up CP2#CP2-bar, the  product of two complex projective lines CP1&#195;&#151;CP1 and ultimately the 4-dimensional sphere S4.

In particular, the ultimate nature of the neutrino (if it is a Dirac or a Majorana particle) plays a crucial role not only in neutrino physics, but in the overall framework of fundamental particle interactions and in cosmology. The only way to disentangle its ultimate nature is to search for the so-called Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (0&#194;&#189;DBD). The goal of LUCIFER is to build a background-free 0&#194;&#189;DBD experiment with a discovery potential better than the future, already approved, funded experiments. Although aiming at a discover, in the case of insufficient sensitivity the LUCIFER technique will be the demonstrator for a higher mass experiment able to probe the entire inverted hierarchy region of the neutrino mass and to start approaching the direct one. The idea of LUCIFER is to join the bolometric technique proposed for the CUORE experiment (one of the few 0&#194;&#189;DBD experiments in construction world-wide) with the bolometric light detection technique used in cryogenic dark matter experiments. The bolometric technique allows an extremely good energy resolution while its combination with the scintillation detection offers an ultimate tool for background rejection. Preliminary tests on several 0&#194;&#189;DBD detectors have clearly demonstrated the excellent background rejection capabilities that arise from the simultaneous, independent, double readout (heat + scintillation)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,294,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LiNAss"><Rcn>106971</Rcn><Nid>8822</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Light-induced NanoAssembly</Name><PI>Jeremy John Baumberg</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>NanoMaterials have huge promise in a wide range of applications of societal importance. Intricate combinations of metals, semiconductors, dielectrics, and molecular components in three-dimensional configurations, have new and unusual properties. Such advanced functions are at the heart of photovoltaics, magnetic and quantum information technologies, photosynthesis, water splitting, electronics, batteries, fuel cells, catalysis and many more crucial areas. Despite much research, we simply cannot yet make such nanomaterials at will. This problem is thus a major challenge for the future decades that we need to solve. The proposal here uses bottom-up assembly of nano-components combined with the application of controlling beams of light, as a new approach to sub-nm precision capable of scale-up.
The exact arrangement of nano-sized components can drastically change the optical response of a nanostructure. We directly exploit this optical sensitivity to structure. Irradiation by specific wavelengths of laser light builds up strong optical fields only in parts of the structure which transiently have the right configuration. These regions of high field can be spatially localised to 1nm, far smaller than the wavelength of light. If this induces enhanced binding then optical selection preferentially selects specific morphologies. The principal goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the new strategies for reliable nano-constructs at the 1nm scale, which can be produced in large numbers with essentially identical architecture. Several approaches will be explored in parallel, using the light to either glue together nano building blocks, or to deposit the energy needed to grow nanostructures directly. In addition developing ways for light to flex structures can result in significant changes to the optical spectra, thus providing exquisitely-sensitive feedback on the nanoscale. Light is a crucial observational tool, requiring development of real-time sub-ms spectroscopies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,050,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LifeNav"><Rcn>99574</Rcn><Nid>8940</Nid><HI>Albert-Ludwigs-Universitaet Freiburg, Germany</HI><Name>Reliable Lifelong Navigation for Mobile Robots</Name><PI>Thomas Wolfram Burgard</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Our goal is to develop the fundamental approaches required to design mobile robot systems that can reliably operate over extended periods of time in dynamically changing environments.

The main areas of study will be:

(a) Structure of null sets and representation of (singular) measures, one of the key motivations being the differentiability of Lipschitz functions in finite dimensional spaces.

(b) Nonlinear geometric functional analysis, with particular attention to the differentiability of Lipschitz functions in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces with separable dual.

(c) Foundations of analysis on metric spaces, the key problems here being representation results for Lipschitz differentiability spaces and spaces satisfying the Poincar\'e inequality.

These changes may be caused by changing requirements, domain assumptions, or computing infrastructure, and may affect the system&#226;&#128;&#153;s implementation, architecture and/or requirements. Evolution may be automatic (aka self-adaptation), or manual, or something in-between. This project aims to develop principles that underlie, and concepts, tools and techniques that support evolution. The project will focus on software-intensive systems. Such systems consist of software, human and organizational elements that work together to fulfill organizational and human objectives. Our proposed research is founded on ideas and research results from Requirements Engineering (RE). Evolution is to be supported by design-time models that are made available at run-time. These models capture system requirements and domain assumptions, augmented with design and implementation details. When evolution is automatic, supported by monitor-diagnose-compensate-execute feedback loops, these models determine (i) what is to be monitored, (ii) whether the system is operating according to its intended purpose, (iii) what are possible compensations for deviations from intended behaviour, (iv) how to evolve the system. When evolution is manual, these models support evolution activities, carried out by humans, by offering a comprehensive picture of the requirements and assumptions under which the system operates, along with traceability links between elements of these models and code. This means that design-time models need to capture stakeholder intentions and commitments, social interactions, business processes, and organizational goals that ultimately determine system requirements.

Taking advantage of the advent of cluster detection via the SZ effect, we will use the most massive clusters of galaxies and their evolution as laboratory. We build on the Planck SZ survey, the first All Sky survey since the RASS X-ray survey. We will substantially extend the nominal Planck cluster catalogue by developing novel detection techniques based on a simultaneous search of objects in Planck and RASS maps, reaching lower masses and higher redshifts, while keeping a high catalogue purity.
For the first time, we will have the sample size, redshift leverage, and completeness, for a decisive test of the standard LCDM model of the dark matter gravitational collapse on cluster scale. The test will be provided by a full statistical analysis of the dark matter profiles and their evolution. The X-ray technique to derive mass profile will be extended to the full cluster population. This will be made possible by an integrated approach involving systematic confrontation of observations with tailor-made numerical simulations.
Using multi-wavelength data and simulations, we will also assess the dynamical behaviour of the baryons as they collect in dark matter potential. We will i) provide the first complete census of the dark matter, hot and cold baryons and its evolution ii) quantify the thermo- dynamical state up to z~1 as a probe of hierarchical structure formation and gravitational heating iii) probe the link between non-thermal and thermal components.
The project will either cement our current understanding of the dark matter collapse, a prerequisite to any assessment of the specific baryon physics, or points towards the need for revision of the current paradigm, with important cosmological implications. The new detection techniques will be applicable to future surveys.

Future sizable improvements in these entrenched industrial processes will require either completely novel production technologies, fundamental analysis/modeling methods, or a combination of both.  This proposal aims to approach this challenge by using multiscale modeling and experimentation on three fronts: (1) detailed analysis of industrial processes to generate new fundamental chemical understanding, (2) multiscale modeling and evaluation of high-volume chemical processes using a multiscale approach and fundamental chemical understanding, and (3) show the practical applicability of the multiscale approach and use it to critically examine novel technologies in the context of industrial processes. The novel technology portion of this proposal will be focused around a class known as rotating bed reactors in a static geometry (RBR-SG).  We will investigate three processes that could benefit from RBR-SG technology: (1) fast pyrolysis of biomass, (2) gasification of biomass, and (3) short contact time catalytic partial oxidation of light hydrocarbons.  Experimental reactor and kinetic work and validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the process mentioned above will be used.  We will construct two RBR-SG units; heat transfer, adsorption, and pyrolysis gas/solid experiments will be performed in one, while non-reacting flow tests will be performed in the other with other phase combinations.  Detailed kinetic models will provide novel insights into the reaction dynamics and impact other research and technologies.

In particular, since Boltzmann and Einstein, we interpret the world we see as the product of the microscopic dynamics of a large number of atoms. In spite of this, no satisfactory rigorous derivation of a macroscopic equation (e.g. the heat equation) from such a microscopic physical model exists. This sorry state of affairs is extremely unsatisfactory both from the theoretical point of view and for applications. Indeed, as the technology is entering the mesoscopic scale (nanotechnology), the need for a rigorous understanding of how the phenomenological macroscopic laws emerge and of their limits of validity becomes paramount. We believe that recent advances in the theory of Dynamical Systems and Probability, to which the members of our team have contributed, allow key progresses in the understanding of the above problem. The ultimate goal of this proposal is the derivation of macroscopic evolution laws from a microscopic Hamiltonian evolution. To this end we will consider a series of intermediate models: a) inspired to an anharmonic chain with some noise (of a fixed strength and not itself responsible for the changes in the local energy); b) inspired to hard spheres interacting via elastic collisions and confined by fixed periodic obstacles (gas of geometrically constrained hard spheres). The above project entails the solution of major problems in the fields of Dynamical Systems and Probability. In addition, it would contribute to substantiate Boltzmann's theoretical picture by providing a conclusive rigorous example of non-equilibrium macroscopic behavior arising from an (interacting) microscopic mechanical model.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,372,720</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MAMBA"><Rcn>111156</Rcn><Nid>10125</Nid><HI>Lunds Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Molecular mechanism of amyloid &#206;&#178; aggregation</Name><PI>Sara Elisabet Snogerup Linse</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Generation of toxic oligomers during aggregation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta42) into amyloid fibrils is a central event in Alzheimer disease. Understanding the aggregation process is therefore one important step towards therapy and diagnosis of the disease. We propose a physical chemistry approach with the goal of finding the molecular mechanisms behind the process in terms of the underlying microscopic steps and the molecular driving forces governing each step. We will use methodology developed recently in our laboratory yielding unprecedented reproducibility in the kinetic data. The methodology relies on optimization of every step from production and purification to isolation of highly pure monomeric peptide, and inertness and minimized area of all surfaces. We will use cell viability studies to detect toxic oligomeric species, and selective radio-labeling experiments to pinpoint the origin of those species. In order to obtain insight into the molecular determinants and the relative role of different kinds of intermolecular interactions for each microscopic step, we will study the concentration dependent aggregation kinetics as a function of extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. Extrinsic parameters include temperature, salt, pH, biological membranes, other proteins, and low and high Mw inhibitors. Intrinsic parameters include point mutations and sequence extension/truncation. We will perform detailed kinetic studies for each inhibitor to learn which step in the process is inhibited coupled to cell toxicity assays to learn whether the generation of toxic oligomers is limited. We will use spectroscopic techniques, dynamic light scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry coupled to HD exchange to learn about structural transitions as a function of process progression under different conditions to favor different microscopic steps.

We will consider systems ranging from the tiny scale of atoms over macroscopic everyday matter to the gigantic scale of stars. Despite the range in scale, these systems may all be described by many-body quantum physics. Our aim is to rigorously understand their stability and structure, in particular, exotic phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superconductivity, superfluidity, and special low-dimensional behavior. The ultimate goal is to understand the full many-body theory but we will also investigate simpler approximate models such as Bogolubov&#226;&#128;&#153;s model for superfluidity, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Ginzburg-Landau (GL) models of superconductivity, and the Hartree-Fock model of atoms and molecules. The role of such models is two-fold. On one hand they are of independent interest. On the other hand and more importantly they may give information about the many-body theory. This is true to the extent we can estimate the degree to which they approximate in appropriate limits.
From a mathematical point of view our approach is variational. All the theories we consider are formulated in terms of energy functionals. The full many-body theories are linear but due to the essentially uncontrolled number of variables they are extremely complicated. The approximate models are non-linear. Surprisingly they are nevertheless significantly simpler due to the reduction in degrees of freedom. Often the limits correspond to semiclassical limits for spectral problems.
Examples of specific goals that we will pursue are
*Establish the thermodynamic properties of matter coupled to electromagnetic fields
*Derive GL theory as a limit of BCS theory
*Estimate ionization energies of large atoms and molecules
*Derive spectral estimates of Lieb-Thirring type for 2D anyons
*Derive semiclassical expansions for problems with low regularity"</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,465,016</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MATFUN"><Rcn>97825</Rcn><Nid>12112</Nid><HI>The University Of Manchester, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Functions of Matrices: Theory and Computation</Name><PI>Nicholas John Higham</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Functions of matrices are widely used in science, engineering and the social sciences, due to the succinct and insightful way they allow problems to be formulated and solutions to be expressed.

Our approach is based on the concept of generalized (weak) solutions satisfying the basic physical principles of balance of mass, momentum, and energy. The energy balance is expressed in terms of a variant of entropy inequality supplemented with an integral identity for the total energy balance.

We propose to identify a class of suitable weak solutions, where admissibility is based on a direct application of the principle of maximal entropy production compatible with Second law of thermodynamics. Stability of the solution family will be investigated by the method of relative entropies constructed on the basis of certain thermodynamics potentials as ballistic free energy.

The new solution framework will be applied to multiscale problems, where several characteristic scales become small or extremely large. We focus on mutual interaction of scales during this process and identify the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are filtered out in the singular limits. We also propose to study the influence of the geometry of the underlying physical space that may change in the course of the limit process. In particular, problems arising in homogenization and optimal shape design in combination with various singular limits are taken into account.

The second research direction explores the computational content using type theory and the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs. Type theory allows us to represent constructive mathematics in a formal way, and provides key insight for the design of proof systems helping in the analysis of the logical structure of mathematical proofs.

Studies of climate changes in the past represent a vital part of climate change research which is essential to assess the current warming against the background of natural climate variability. Due to strong limitations in direct observations, climate reconstructions for the past can only be achieved using natural climate archives. The paleoclimatic archive in ice cores provides not only information on climate variability over many thousands of years in high resolution but also on greenhouse gases, aerosol concentrations and more. Crucial questions on climate variability on interannual to orbital time scales and on the coupling processes and teleconnections in the climate system remain still open. To answer these questions novel climate parameters on polar ice cores are needed that go beyond previous studies in terms of temporal resolution, spatial coverage as well as quantitative representativeness. This proposal intends to develop such methods based on latest advances in analytical techniques and to apply them to polar ice cores. The common theme of the new approaches within MATRICs is the reconstruction of new, quantitative temperature information from different regions of the Earth all on the same core avoiding crucial crossdating issues. This comprises (i) continuous quantitative reconstructions of local temperature changes on polar ice sheets in seasonal resolution using new approaches, (ii) estimates of climate changes in continental, not permanently ice covered regions based on concurrent changes in the methane cycle and (iii) a new physical ice core gas thermometer for mean global ocean temperature. Successful implementation of the studies in MATRICs will make a significant contribution to maintain the world leading position of European ice core science.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,100,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MCC"><Rcn>110436</Rcn><Nid>10214</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Mapping the Complexity of Counting</Name><PI>Leslie Ann Goldberg</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Just as advances in engineering rely on a deep foundational knowledge of physics, so too advances in algorithms and programming rely on a deep knowledge of the intrinsic nature of computation. Significant progress has been made, particularly in the field of computational complexity, which aims to discover which computational problems are feasible, which are inherently infeasible, and why. However, huge theoretical challenges remain: many problem classes are poorly understood, including those containing problems arising in practical applications. The MCC project will enable significant computational advances in a host of application areas through the development of a comprehensive theory of counting problems. These problems, which involve the computation of weighted sums, are common and important, arising in practical applications from diverse fields including statistics, statistical physics, information theory, coding, and machine learning. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand their complexity. We propose a coherent and systematic study of the complexity of counting problems. A sequence of exciting recent developments, pioneered by the PI and others, makes it plausible that we now have the tools needed to make substantial progress. The overall objectives of MCC are (1) Map out the landscape of computational counting problems (exact and approximate), determining which problems are tractable, and which are intractable (quantifying the extent of tractability), and (2) Develop complexity characterisations elucidating the features that make counting problems tractable or intractable, not only discovering which problems are tractable, but also discovering a characterisation telling us why. The project encompasses a large range of wide-open problems.

The subject has a central role in mathematics with connections to number theory, representation theory, and topology. Moduli questions in algebraic geometry concern the behavior of varieties as the coefficients of the defining polynomials vary. At the end of the 20th century several fundamental links between the algebraic geometry of moduli spaces and path integrals in quantum field theory were made. I propose to study the moduli spaces of curves, sheaves, and K3 surfaces. While these moduli problems have independent roots, striking new relationships between them have been found in the past decade. I will exploit the new perspectives to attack central questions concerning the algebra of tautological classes on the moduli spaces of curves, the structure of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of 3-folds including correspondences and Virasoro constraints, the modular properties of the invariants of K3 surfaces, and the Noether-Lefschetz loci of the moduli of K3 surfaces.  The proposed approach to these questions uses a mix of new geometries and new techniques. The new geometries include the moduli spaces of stable quotients and stable pairs  introduced in the past few years. The new techniques involve a combination of virtual localization, degeneration, and descendent  methods together with new ideas from log geometry.

Precise measurements of the properties of the new boson are now mandatory and must be reflected in a similar quest for higher precision from the theory side. We aim to meet this challenge by developing a theoretical framework together with suitable high-precision tools that will guarantee the continued success of the LHC programme.

The aim of this proposal is therefore to develop and establish a new standard of theoretical precision in the description of physical observables at the LHC and other particle collider experiments, thereby leading to a more precise extraction of fundamental physics parameters, such as the couplings of the Higgs boson to other fundamental particles.   The necessary theoretical precision will be achieved by systematically including the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) corrections in the perturbative expansion in the relevant simulation tools, focusing on crucial
experimental benchmark processes.

The techniques and frameworks we will develop will be applicable to other processes and in particular, will be very relevant to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and in the further interpretation of any signals that would indicate such a discovery.

However, over the last decade, things have changed dramatically. Today one can envision manipulating large quantum systems, while mastering individual degrees of freedom. It is thus timely to ask entirely new questions on the quantum/classical transition and to support these by experimental investigations of large entanglement. The vision of this project is to explore conceptually, experimentally and technologically the limits of large entanglement of macroscopically distinguishable quantum states. We propose to demonstrate entanglement between two or more macroscopic crystals with hundreds of entanglement bits (e-bits), hundred of thousands of excitations and billions of ions. For this purpose, we&#226;&#128;&#153;ll use Neodymium doped YSO crystals and our AFC (Atomic Frequency Comb) protocol for multimode quantum memories.

Since entanglement is the signature of quantumness, this project will demonstrate &#226;&#128;&#156;macroscopic&#226;&#128;&#157; entanglement and help sharpening the meaning of &#226;&#128;&#156;large&#226;&#128;&#157; and &#226;&#128;&#156;macroscopic&#226;&#128;&#157;.

This will deepen our understanding of Nature and in particular of the intricate meaning of meso- and macroscopic.

Two further goals of this project are to demonstrate large entanglement between two crystals separated by tens of kilometres, and to teleport many qubits stored in a crystal to a distant one.

Although this project is on fundamental questions, it will also contribute to improving the quantum memories required for continental scale ultra-secure quantum communications.

This performance growth rate has been an enabler for the dramatic innovation in information technology that now embraces our society. Before 2004, application developers could exploit this performance growth rate with no effort.  However, since 2004 power consumption of computer chips exceeded the allowable limits and from that point and onwards, parallel computer architectures became the norm. Currently, parallelism is completely exposed to application developers and managing it is difficult and time-consuming. This has a serious impact on software productivity that may stall progress in information technology.

Technology forecasts predict that by 2020 there will be hundreds of processors on a computer chip. Apart from managing parallelism, keeping power consumption within allowable limits will remain a key roadblock for maintaining historical performance growth rates. Power efficiency must increase by an order of magnitude in the next ten years to not limit the growth rate. Finally, computer chips are also key components in embedded controllers, where stringent timing responses are mandatory. Delivering predictable and tight response times using parallel architectures is a challenging and unsolved problem.

MECCA takes a novel, interdisciplinary and unconventional approach to address three important challenges facing computer architecture &#226;&#128;&#147; the three Ps: Parallelism, Power, and Predictability in a unified framework.

This proposal targets a novel extended multiscale computational homogenization framework, in order to make a breakthrough in lifting scale separation limits restricting existing scale bridging methods. This method enables designs using groundbreaking concepts, as used in advanced mechanical metamaterials, offering superb properties in e.g. energy absorption or harvesting, dynamic and multi-functional properties. This novel route relies on a multiscale design that exploits, rather than avoids, the complex interactions between the scales involved.

The proposed methodology is fundamentally new with a potentially large impact on many multiscale methods. The computational homogenization method will be taken as the starting point, since it is one of the most powerful multiscale methods available. To enable the anticipated breakthrough, the coarse scale description will be enriched by key characteristics of the fine scale fluctuation fields that are responsible for the breakdown of scale separation. A generalized micromorphic continuum thus emerges at the coarse scale.

The analysis of the fine scale fluctuation fields will be established in a strongly coupled numerical-experimental approach, making use of integrated image and field correlation methods. Full kinematical fields at different scales and different stages of deformation will be used. Particular attention is given to computational efficiency, by a newly developed dedicated reduced order model for the extended multiscale scheme. The added value of the novel multiscale method and its practical applicability will be demonstrated by analysing the damage-to-fracture transition in a multi-phase steel.

To model their behaviour, either a solid- or fluid mechanics approach is used. Rather than deforming uniformly, granular fluids develop thin shear-bands, which mark areas of flow, material failure and energy dissipation. The MEDIGRA project proposes a thorough experimental, theoretical and numerical study of the Mechanics of Energy DIssipation in dense GRAnular materials. The fundamental challenge faced by the project is to quantify the various energy dissipation mechanisms in dense granular materials using innovative thermo-poromechanical experiments. The measured characteristics are expected to lead to the formulation of appropriate analytical and numerical tools aimed to describe the mechanical behaviour of granular materials from the rigorous angle of energetics. In particular, the project proposes to: 1) Design, develop, install and exploit a novel Thermographic High Speed Cylinder Shear Apparatus (THSCSA) to study the properties of the mechanical and thermal boundary layer that is forming at the inner rotating-drum material interface, as well as determining the required thermographic properties of granular materials. 2) Convincingly quantify the way the total energy dissipation is split into heat production, grain breakage and other mechanisms, using the project-developed THSCSA apparatus and other advanced experimental apparatuses. 3) Develop physical models and robust numerical tools capable of incorporating the experimentally obtained dissipation characteristics. 4) Test the knowledge acquired within the project in two applications (shear segregation and landslide modelling).

Using single-ion storage in a well-defined small volume with perfectly controlled electromagnetic fields for nearly unlimited periods of time, we will measure the eigenfrequencies of the particles with unprecedented precision in dedicated Penning traps. From those values, fundamental properties such as the magnetic moment, atomic and nuclear mass or, equivalent, binding energy can be extracted. This will reveal the strength of all interactions present in the quantum mechanical system. Our new results combined with established theories will yield values for fundamental constants like the electron mass and the fine structure constant &#206;&#177;.  In order to meet these challenges novel trap geometries, ultra-sensitive and low-noise single-ion detection techniques will be developed and combined with other technological advances in order to enable us to reach up to one order of magnitude improved values for the quantities mentioned above."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,158,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MEMBrane"><Rcn>106764</Rcn><Nid>12722</Nid><HI>Stichting Voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek Der Materie - Fom, Netherlands</HI><Name>MEMS made Electron Emission Membranes</Name><PI>Hendrik Van Der Graaf</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>We propose a radically new and generic type of detector for photons, electrons and energetic charged particles: a stacked set of curved miniature dynodes in vacuum, created through MicroMechanical Electronic Systems (MEMS) fabrication techniques on top of a state-of-the-art CMOS pixel chip. This combination in itself is an extremely efficient electron detector. By capping the system with a traditional photocathode, a highly sensitive timed photon counter can be realized, outperforming all existing photon detectors. By capping it with an Electron Emission Membrane, a timed particle tracking detector is realized with a time resolution far superior to current particle counters.

The core innovation, i.e., the stacked curved dynodes on top of a pixel chip, will revolutionize electron detection in solid-state, atomic and molecular physics experiments. As a photon detector, it will have pico-second time resolution, much better than classical photomultipliers, at low noise. This will have impact on the field of medical imaging, optical communication, night-vision equipment and even 3D image recording by measuring the time-of flight of photons from a flashlight. As a particle detector, it will allow faster and higher-resolution measurements of the trajectories of fast charged particles, essential in modern particle physics experiments. Its time resolution is three orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art Si planar detectors, opening new horizons for (vertex) tracking, time-of-flight spectrometers, track pattern recognition and trigger detectors.

The realization of this detector concept requires high-risk/high-impact developments in the area of (1) fundamental understanding of electron emission, (2) the MEMS-based fabrication of novel curved transmission dynodes and (3) high-efficiency Electron Emission Membranes. To achieve these objectives, the PI will lead a concerted effort of technical physicists and theoreticians.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,396,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MEMSforLife"><Rcn>106969</Rcn><Nid>9923</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Microfluidic systems for the study of living roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans) and tissues</Name><PI>Martinus Adela Maria Gijs</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal situated at the interfaces of the microengineering, biological and medical fields aims to develop microfluidic chips for studying living roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), living cultured liver tissue slices obtained from mice, and formaldehyde/paraffin-fixed human breast cancer tissue slices and tumors.

We will develop electron counting tools which will not only allow to full characterization of electron statistics but also open the way to new quantum interference experiments involving few electrons or fractional charge carriers and will question our understanding of quantum statistics. Generation of few electron bunches will be obtained by the yet never done technique of short voltage pulses whose duration is limited to few action quanta, one quantum for one electron. Detection of electron bunches will be done by an unprecedented technique of cut and probe where carriers are suddenly isolated in the circuit for further sensitive charge detection. Using highly ballistic electron nanostructures such as Graphene, III-V semiconductors with light carriers, Carbone Nanotubes or simply tunnel barriers, we will bring mesoscopic quantum noise effects to higher temperature, energy and frequency range, and thus closer to applications. Inspired by late R. Landauer s saying: the noise IS the signal we will develop totally new detectors based on the universal effect of photon-assisted electron shot noise. These versatile broadband detectors will be used either for on-chip noise detection or for photon radiation detection, possibly including imaging. They will operate above liquid Helium temperature and at THz frequencies although projected operation includes room temperature and far-infrared range as no fundamental limitation is expected. The complete program, balanced between very fundamental quantum issues and applications of quantum effects, will open routes for new quantum investigations and offer to a broad community new applications of mesoscopic effects.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,843</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MERESPO"><Rcn>102398</Rcn><Nid>10934</Nid><HI>Universite De Fribourg, Switzerland</HI><Name>Mechanically Responsive Polymers</Name><PI>Christoph Weder</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"&#226;&#128;&#156;Intelligent&#226;&#128;&#157; polymers which change their properties &#226;&#128;&#156;on command&#226;&#128;&#157;, that is upon exposure to a pre-defined stimulus in a highly selective and reversible manner, are of considerable academic interest and attractive for countless technologically relevant applications.

Specifically, we will exploit the special coordination and activation ability of different metal complexes towards pi-systems to induce chemo-selective reactions of designed, abiotic, unsaturated substrates. Moreover, and importantly, the metal catalysts will be conjugated to designed ligands or biopolymers so that the catalytic power of the metal complex can be transferred to specific &#226;&#128;&#156;in vivo&#226;&#128;&#157; locations.

Ultimately, we want to install catalytic power in specific cellular sites and/or endow catalytic properties to any selected bio-molecular target. The catalytic activity could then be used to trigger the amplified generation of fluorescent signals or boost the production of bioactive drugs from inert, non-toxic precursors.

I propose a new technique to determine these local variations of the electronic properties. The central objective is to measure with nanometer-scale spatial resolution the frequency-dependent electrodynamic properties, such as complex dielectric constant and complex conductivity of quantum materials at frequencies in the several hundreds of GHz range. The method is derived from the recent progress in astronomical instruments for the submillimeter (hundreds of GHz to THz) frequency band. This progress, to which I contributed extensively, is driven by the desire to study the universe. Now, with this technology and expertise in hand, the disciplinary boundaries can be crossed once more and directed to the other challenging frontier of quantum materials. With this instrument it will become possible to determine the local (and possibly frequency-dependent) electromagnetic properties, such as the dielectric constant and conductivity, for a range of materials.
Through this technique, I will make it possible to study the local properties of new materials and even to get access to the local energy-scales of their excitations.

The magnetostrophic regime is the state in which Lorentz (magnetic) forces are balanced by Coriolis (rotational) forces and pressure gradients and is thought to be the zeroth order force balance in the core. We propose a series of ground-breaking experiments using liquid sodium contained in a rapidly rotating sphere containing a differentially rotating solid inner sphere. For the first time electric current is injected into the fluid in different configurations in order that the Lorentz force is everywhere significant. Various other magnetic fields can be applied from the exterior and the interior. The influence of turbulence, viscous and magnetic boundary layers will be examined. The presence of instabilities and wave motion will be studied, and the existence of steady solutions will be naturally determined. Diagnostic measurements of magnetic fields and electrical potentials, and Doppler velocimetry will characterise the experiment. These unique experiments are backed by numerical calculations. Complementary studies will analyse the observed magnetic field over the last 400 years in the same magnetostrophic framework. An inverse method will be developed to find the initial state of the field that evolves in a manner compatible with observations. This will elucidate the interior structure of the magnetic field for the first time, determining the amplitude and morphology of the field.

One of the greatest challenges to encourage these systems to be adopted by industry is successful high level integration with sensors for understanding, optimisation and control of microsystems for various processes. The proposed research will develop such systems and their integration via linking them with chemical imaging. The benefits of chemical engineering at smaller lengthscales are manifold; the design of microchemical processes is important where, by nature, it is essential to have microdevices, e.g. in cell biology manipulation and transformations. Other processes can be designed macroscopically, but a move to microprocesses gives process advantages, such as enhanced heat and mass transfer, novel flow regimes, bringing material and process time and lengthscales into the same region to allow material property and process interactions, which would be impossible in macro-reactors. In order to achieve this, it is essential to have the capability of rapid 3D chemical imaging on a nano/microscale, as only by devising these new techniques to image microchemical systems, it will be possible to optimise them for novel engineering. The proposal is aimed at providing chemical imaging capability to miniaturised devices for the engineering of new materials and processes. It is proposed (i) to use chemical imaging and micro-deposition methods for the generation of materials with responsive gradient structures; (ii) to engineer nanostructured materials aided by high-resolution chemical imaging; (iii) to combine microfluidics with chemical imaging as a prototype of miniaturised chemical factories.

Previously artificial nacre has been mimicked by multilayer and sequential techniques and ice-templating. However, concepts for aligned spontaneous self-assemblies are called for scalability.

Nanofibrillated cellulose will be wet-spun using extrusion into coagulant bath, followed by post drawing, drying and functionalization to allow silk-like fibers with high mechanical properties. In another route, cellulose rod-like whiskers will be decorated with soft functional polymers allowing energy dissipation, followed by alignment and interlinking to mimick silk-assemblies. The colloidal routes allow also new functionalities by using functional polymers, e.g. electroactive and conjugated polymers and nanoparticles. Importantly, redox-active polymers are bound on the colloidal sheets. Incorporating in a planar electrochemical cell with flexible electrodes, electrochemical switching of stiffness is obtained using a small voltage, as the intercolloidal interaction is controlled by the charge state of the redox-active layers.

The prevailing idea is that the Bang of the Big Bang was an early burst of exponential expansion, dubbed inflation. A key prediction of inflation is that it generated gravitational waves. The corresponding ripples in the space-time geometry left an imprint in the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). A new generation of experiments are making a major step towards this signal by mapping the microwave sky polarisation with an unprecedented sensitivity and combination of sky coverage, angular resolution and wavelengths. These experiments may show whether the energy scale of inflation predicted by the simplest models is correct. However, unlike for temperature anisotropies, Galactic foregrounds have larger amplitude than any putative primordial B-mode signal.

Precision calculations in the electroweak theory will also play a role in confronting later precision data with theoretical models. The related maximally (N=4) supersymmetric gauge theory has served both as an important theoretical laboratory for developing new calculational techniques, as well as a link to string theory via the AdS/CFT duality.

For microscopically complex porous layers and active sites, submodels will be developed by considering the detailed elementary kinetic rates based on the intermediate chemical species and their reactions occurring on the surface of the involved materials.  As the inputs, the obtained data from the microscopic submodels will be implemented by the macroscopic CFD codes, previously developed for various applications, to examine local parameters in the porous electrodes and components. Both macro- and microscopic models will be validated by the experimental and/or literature data during the course of the project. The project will make progress beyond the state-of-the-art in modelling and analysis of advanced fuel cells, such as ultra low Pt loading (</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,320,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-06-01, </Start_date><End_date /></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOBILE-W"><Rcn>98838</Rcn><Nid>9264</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Exploring Mobile Interfaces: Domain Walls as Functional Elements</Name><PI>Nava Setter</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Very recent findings by our group and others reveal that ferroelectric interfaces can show strongly enhanced properties and remarkable new effects with potential for exploitation in devices. In particular, new phases at broadened domain walls [DWs], conductivity and possibility for ferromagnetism in ferroelectric DWs and giant response in materials possessing high density ferroelectric DWs were shown
DWs form spontaneously in ferroelectrics. Their functionality, widely recognized is neither quantified nor controlled. Distinctly from other interfaces, ferroelectric DWs are mobile, can be modified dynamically by external forces (electrical, stress, temperature variation) and can, moreover, be annihilated and recreated
What are the mechanisms to functionalize DWs? How to gain control over the structure and dynamics of these DWs, and what are the potential breakthroughs that such control may lead to? What additional properties of DWs await discovery? We will address these questions through several interrelated objectives designed to cover both fundamental aspects, as well as limits of applicability
Considering a single DW as a device that can be created, displaced and eliminated reversibly in-situ is unique to this project. Working with ordered arrays of DWs is another central theme. To create controlled patterns of DWs we will use top-down and bottom-up approaches. Characterization of DWs will range from investigation of the internal structure by Spherical Aberration Corrected HRTEM through cryogenic Piezo Force Microscopy study of DW phase-transition, to macroscopic characterization over a broad frequency and driving stimulus range. Theory will guide the investigation. Device concepts will be demonstrated, such as DW-enhanced ultrasonic transducer, DW transistor and ferroelectric string memory
We believe that attainment of these objectives should lead to conceptual breakthroughs both in our understanding of ferroelectric interfaces and in their applications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,475,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOBOCON"><Rcn>103501</Rcn><Nid>8885</Nid><HI>Technische Universitat Dortmund, Germany</HI><Name>Model-based optimizing control- from a vision to industrial reality</Name><PI>Johannes Karl Sebastian Engell</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal focuses on the operation of processing units in chemical and biochemical production plants. A new approach, demonstrated recently in the lab and pilot scales as being feasible, is to perform a dynamic online optimization of the plant operating parameters in order to achieve an economically optimal operation while meeting constraints on emissions, product quality and operating limits of the equipment. Traditionally, meeting the specifications on product purity and quality, yield etc. is achieved by feedback control of the processing conditions to set-points determined by experienced operators or by an infrequent stationary optimization. In the optimizing control approach, the main degrees of freedom of the plant are not used to regulate certain variables to set-points but adapted dynamically to achieve an optimal performance  In a joint effort by two internationally leading research groups in process operations and in numerical methods for dynamic optimization, we will tackle the main obstacles to the widespread industrial application of this extremely promising approach and will realize:
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Increased reliability and robustness of the algorithms and of the overall control scheme
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Reduction of the modelling effort and increase of the model accuracy by combining rigorous models with online adaptation
&#226;&#128;&#162;	New concepts for human-controller interaction to increase acceptance and performance.
Moreover, we will extend the scope of the application of optimizing control to large transitions where discrete control variables are manipulated, e.g. during start-up and shut-down.
The robustness and the power of optimizing control and the new concepts for the interaction with the operators will be validated and demonstrated by an application to a very challenging and innovative process in the pilot scale. The approach and the methods are transferable to the broad domain of processes where materials are transformed (e.g. iron and steel, glass, food and beverages)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,491,632</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOCOPOLY"><Rcn>102464</Rcn><Nid>10377</Nid><HI>Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet Erlangen Nuernberg, Germany</HI><Name>Multi-scale, Multi-physics MOdelling and COmputation of magneto-sensitive POLYmeric materials</Name><PI>Paul Alfred Steinmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>MOCOPOLY is a careful revision of an AdG2010-proposal that was evaluated above the quality threshold in steps1&amp;2. In the meantime the applicant has made further considerable progress related to the topics of MOCOPOLY. Magneto-sensitive polymers (elastomers) are novel smart materials composed of a rubber-like matrix filled with magneto-active particles. The non-linear elastic characteristics of the matrix combined with the magnetic properties of the particles allow these compounds to deform dramatically in response to relatively low external magnetic fields. The rapid response, the high level of deformations achievable, and the possibility to control these deformations by adjusting the external magnetic field, make these materials of special interest for the novel design of actuators for a fascinating variety of technological applications. It is the overall objective of this proposal to uncover the process-microstructure-properties relations of the emerging novel multi-scale, multi-physics material class of magneto-sensitive polymers with the aim to better exploit its promising potential for future, currently unimagined technological applications. This objective will only be achieved by performing integrated multi-disciplinary research in fabrication, characterisation, modelling, simulation, testing and parameter identification. This proposal therefore sets up a work programme consisting of nine strongly interconnected work packages that are devoted to 1) fabrication of magneto-sensitive polymers, 2) microstructure characterisation by modelling and simulation, 3) microstructure characterisation by CT-scanning, 4) continuum physics modelling at the micro-scale, 5) computational multi-physics homogenisation, 6) continuum physics modelling at the macro-scale, 7) testing at the macro-scale, 8) multi-scale parameter identification and 9) macro-scale parameter identification. The work programme is therefore characterised by various feedback loops between the work packages.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MODAG"><Rcn>101679</Rcn><Nid>10445</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Model Theory and asymptotic geometry</Name><PI>Ehud Hrushovski</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The principal methods of model theory, in its connections to algebraic geometry, have been quantifier elimination (e.g. Tarski's theorem)
and structural stability (used here in a wide sense, including simplicity, NIP and structural o-minimality.)
We propose to move beyond current limitations on both fronts, by means of three interrelated projects.   (1)  A study of definable sets in global fields.  A successful quantifier elimination result in this setting would extend the reach of model theory to wide areas of number theory and geometry that have not been accessible before, including points of small height in number theory, and the Gromov-Witten invariants of a variety in geometry.    (2) A study of limits of o-minimal metric structures as quotients of non-archimedean structures,    extending similar measure and group-theoretic  work  that has led to a resolution of Pillay's conjectures in the o-minimal setting, and leading towards a model theory of Calabi-Yau degenerations.    (3)   Model theoretic asymptotic limits lead to  measure and dimension theories, with associated dependence theories,   that resemble known structures from stability theory but do not lie within the stable realm or its current extensions.    Preliminary stability-theoretic considerations have already led to significant applications in combinatorics.    We propose creating a structural stability theory based on pseudo-finite dimension, expected to create a long-term bridge between model theory and
additive combinatorics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,393,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MODFLAT"><Rcn>110442</Rcn><Nid>12658</Nid><HI>Universite De Geneve, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Moduli of flat connections, planar networks and associators"</Name><PI>Anton Alekseev</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The project lies at the crossroads between three different topics in Mathematics: moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces in Differential Geometry and Topology, the Kashiwara-Vergne problem and Drinfeld associators in Lie theory, and combinatorics of planar networks in the theory of Total Positivity.

The time is ripe to establish deep connections between these three theories. The main factors are the recent progress in the Kashiwara-Vergne theory (including the proof of the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture by Alekseev-Meinrenken), the discovery of a link between the Horn problem on eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices and planar network combinatorics, and  intimate links with the Topological Quantum Field Theory shared by the three topics.

The scientific objectives of the project include answering the following questions:
1) To find a universal non-commutative volume formula for moduli of flat connections which would contain the Witten&#226;&#128;&#153;s volume formula, the Verlinde formula, and the Moore-Nekrasov-Shatashvili formula as particular cases.
2) To show that all solutions of the Kashiwara-Vergne problem come from Drinfeld associators. If the answer is indeed positive, it will have applications to the study of the Gothendieck-Teichm&#195;&#188;ller Lie algebra grt.
3) To find a Gelfand-Zeiltin type integrable system for the symplectic group Sp(2n). This question is open since 1983.

To achieve these goals, one needs to use a multitude of techniques. Here we single out the ones developed by the author:
-	Quasi-symplectic and quasi-Poisson Geometry and the theory of group valued moment maps.
-	The linearization method for Poisson-Lie groups relating the additive problem z=x+y and the multiplicative problem Z=XY.
-	Free Lie algebra approach to the Kashiwara-Vergne theory, including the non-commutative divergence and Jacobian cocylces.
-	Non-abelian topical calculus which establishes a link between the multiplicative problem and combinatorics of planar networks."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,148,211</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MODPHYSFRICT"><Rcn>107051</Rcn><Nid>12887</Nid><HI>Scuola Internazionale Superiore Di Studi Avanzati Di Trieste, Italy</HI><Name>Modeling the Physics of Nano-Friction</Name><PI>Erio Tosatti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"In the next five years, novel nanoscale friction experiments will provide decisive data on the physics of a century-old, central, yet incompletely understood area of physics. Nano and mesoscopic phenomena without historical precedent in classic friction are emerging in tip based and other sliding and dissipation measurements. Opportunities for the control of friction, based on harnessing and modifying collective phenomena in the substrate are in the works; and fresh spectroscopic insights into the quantum phenomena in solids and surfaces are currently obtained by nanofrictional means. Finally, exciting laser based sliding nanosystems just appeared. All this experimental opulence demands a strong matching theoretical effort:  and just that is the scope of this project. I and my group will model, calculate and simulate the frictional anomalies accompanying structural and ferroelectric phase transitions as an opportunity for friction control; and will pursue the noncontact dissipation anomalies as a local spectroscopic tool of electronic, magnetic and quantum transitions. A strong priority will be the theory and simulation of sliding in trapped colloids and cold ions on laser generated periodic potentials, where nanoscale and mesoscale sliding phenomena promise to be uniquely accessible. The range of approaches will cover phenomenology, model building and testing, molecular dynamics atomistic simulations of sliding, both empirical and ab initio, electronic and magnetic dissipation modeling; and ordinary condensed matter theory, along with non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. To achieve that scope, I will put together students, postdocs, and leading condensed matter theorists operating mostly in SISSA Trieste, but also in ICTP Trieste and elsewhere, assembling a strong team in good contact with European experimental groups. Their complementarity will allow this unified project to attain results much beyond what the team members could individually achieve."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,550,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MODULI"><Rcn>102233</Rcn><Nid>11090</Nid><HI>Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Bonn, Germany</HI><Name>Geometry of moduli spaces and mapping class groups</Name><PI>Ursula Annemarie Hamenst&#195;&#164;dt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The primary goal of the project is to obtain an understanding of geometric and dynamical properties of moduli spaces and mapping class groups. For a mapping class group of a surface of finite type, we are interested in subgroups, in particular in the trace fields of Veech groups beyond the case of genus 2. Convex cocompact surface subgroups are word hyperbolic surface-by-surface groups, and we aim at clarifying whether or not such groups exist.

Fine asymptotics of the distribution of periodic orbits for the Teichm&#195;&#188;ller flow on strata of quadratic or abelian differentials can be related to dynamical zeta functions. A Borel conjugacy of the Teichm&#195;&#188;ller flow on the moduli space of quadratic differentials into the Weil-Petersson flow will be used to analyze dynamical properties of the Weil-Petersson flow.

The handlebody is a finitely presented subgroup of the mapping class group which however is not quasi-isometrically embedded. A new geometric model for the group will be used towards obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the geometry of this group, in particular with respect to calculating the Dehn function and quasi-isometric rigidigy.

This field was inspired by the notion that miniaturization of magnetic field structures enables the creation of large field gradients, i.e., large forces and tight potentials for atoms. It also has been crucial that present-day microelectronics technology makes it possible to integrate multiple tools and devices onto a compact surface area. Such atom chips have been used to demonstrate rapid Bose-Einstein condensation and have found applications in matter-wave interferometry and in inertial and gravitational field sensing. Likewise, the engineering of miniaturized electric field structures holds great promise for the manipulation of polar molecules above a chip. The ability of a molecule to rotate and to vibrate allows for the coupling to photons over a wide range of frequencies. This might enable, for instance, to implement proposed schemes of quantum computation that use polar molecules as qubits. The use of miniaturized traps also brings quantum-degeneracy for samples of polar molecules closer. However, experimentally proven concepts to load and detect molecules on a chip are still in their infancy. In this project, we will develop and exploit experimental methods to load and detect polar molecules on a chip. Molecules are directly loaded from a supersonic beam into miniaturized electric field traps above the chip. For this, these traps originally move along with the molecular beam at a velocity of several hundred meters per second and are then brought to a complete standstill over a distance of only a few centimeters. After a certain holding time, e.g., after the experiments on the chip are over, the molecules are accelerated off the chip again for detection. This methodology is applicable to a wide variety of polar molecules, enabling the realization of a molecular laboratory on a chip.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,171,760</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOLECULAR MOTORS"><Rcn>89020</Rcn><Nid>11688</Nid><HI>Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Netherlands</HI><Name>Molecular Motors- Controlling movement at the nanoscale</Name><PI>Bernard Feringa</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The design of artificial molecular motors and machines is one of the major challenges in contemporary molecular sciences and bottom-up molecular nanotechnology. Whereas the protein-based molecular motors found in the living cell are amongst the most fascinating and complex structures found in nature and crucial to nearly every key biological process, the field of synthetic linear and rotary motors is still in its infancy. In a broader context moving molecular sciences from the current situation with a focus on static structures and operation under thermodynamic control to dynamic chemistries with systems under kinetic control will represent a major step beyond current frontiers of chemical sciences. Furthermore, a shift from control of structure to dynamic control of function and from molecules to molecular systems, where several components act in concert often at different hierarchical levels, makes it possible for fascinating and unique properties to be discovered. In this program the goal is to significantly push ahead the frontiers of the field of molecular motors and machines both with respect to control of translational and rotary motion, as well as the exploration of dynamic functions of molecular systems governed by molecular motors. A further extremely challenging goal is to explore synthetic systems that can undergo autonomous motion. This program builds on our recent discoveries of the first unidirectional light-driven rotary molecular motor, the chemical driven rotary motor that can complete a full rotary cycle in a repetitive manner and the first molecular defined autonomous translational motor powered by a chemical fuel.  As the basic principles, rules and parameters that govern molecular motion at the nanoscale are, largely, not yet understood, the focus of this proposal is on a multidisciplinary program addressing some of the most challenging fundamental issues in this uncharted territory.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,175,970</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOLFACTORY"><Rcn>111048</Rcn><Nid>11431</Nid><HI>The University Of Manchester, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Machinery for Molecular Factories</Name><PI>David Leigh</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The widespread use of molecular-level motion in key natural processes suggests that great rewards could come from bridging the gap between the present generation of synthetic molecular systems&#226;&#128;&#148;which by and large rely upon electronic and chemical effects to carry out their functions&#226;&#128;&#148;and the machines of the macroscopic world, which utilize the synchronized movements of smaller parts to perform particular tasks.

In the past fifteen years they have attracted  great interest for their potentiality to act as magnetic memory units and for the many quantum effects in the dynamics of their magnetization. Recently our observation that the magnetic bistability is retained when a tetranuclear iron(III) molecular cluster is grafted to a metallic surface has renewed the interest in these materials, which appear the ideal candidates for fundamental investigations on the interplay between conducting electrons and magnetic degrees of freedom in the emerging field of molecular spintronics. In this project we plan to benefit from our leading position in the research on SMMs to explore novel phenomena originated by the combination of SMMs with conducting and magnetic substrates in hybrid structures. Our interdisciplinary approach starts  from the design and synthesis of SMMs and includes their assembling on surface from solution or in high vacuum as well as the tuning of the interaction with conducting, and magnetic substrates through chemical tuning of SMMs. We will focus on the quantum dynamics of the magnetization that seems particularly affected by the interaction with a magnetic substrate opening perspectives for novel spintronic devices and for an unexplored strategy to increase the blocking temperature of SMMs. Additional aspects will be investigated, in particular the use of switchable magnetic molecules as well as the possibility to modify the interface with yet unexplored approaches, for instance exploiting the magnetic torque on molecules with large magnetic anisotropy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,269,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOLNANOSPIN"><Rcn>88587</Rcn><Nid>11712</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Molecular spintronics using single-molecule magnets</Name><PI>Wolfgang Wernsdorfer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>A revolution in electronics is in view, with the contemporary evolution of two novel disciplines, spintronics and molecular electronics. A fundamental link between these two fields can be established using molecular magnetic materials and, in particular, single-molecule magnets, which combine the classic macroscale properties of a magnet with the quantum properties of a nanoscale entity. The resulting field, molecular spintronics aims at manipulating spins and charges in electronic devices containing one or more molecules. The main advantage is that the weak spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions in organic molecules suggest that spin-coherence may be preserved over time and distance much longer than in conventional metals or semiconductors. In addition, specific functions (e.g. switchability with light, electric field etc.) could be directly integrated into the molecule.  In this context, the project proposes to fabricate, characterize and study molecular devices (molecular spin-transistor, molecular spin-valve and spin filter, molecular double-dot devices, carbon nanotube nano-SQUIDs, etc.) in order to read and manipulate the spin states of the molecule and to perform basic quantum operations. MolNanoSpin is designed to play a role of pathfinder in this  still largely unexplored - field. The main target for the coming 5 years concerns fundamental science, but applications in quantum electronics are expected in the long run.  The visionary concept of MolNanoSpin is underpinned by worldwide research on molecular magnetism and supramolecular chemistry, the 10-year long experience in molecular magnetism of the PI, his membership in FP6  MAGMANet  NoE, and collaboration with outstanding scientists in the close environment of the team.

The resulting material is arrested in a metastable state. Most previous work has focused on the relationship between structure and properties, while insight into the guiding principles governing the formation of a (new) material, has been lacking. However, a comprehensive molecular level understanding of non-equilibrium assembly would allow for control and manipulation of material processes and their resulting properties. This lag of knowledge can be traced to the formidable challenge in obtaining a molecular picture of non-equilibrium assembly. Non-equilibrium processes have been studied extensively on a macroscopic level by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We take a novel route approaching the challenge from a molecular point of view. Recent advances in experimental, but especially computational modeling, now allow to follow (supra-) molecular structural evolution across the range of length and time scales necessary to comprehend, and ultimately control and manipulate macroscopic functional properties of soft matter at the molecular level. Soft matter is particularly suited for that approach, as it is &#226;&#128;&#156;slow&#226;&#128;&#157; and easy to manipulate. We take the computational physics route, based on simulations on different levels of resolution (all atom, coarse grained, continuum) in combination with recent multiscale and adaptive resolution techniques. This work will initiate the way towards a paradigm change from conventional Structure Property Relations (SPR) to molecularly based Structure Process Property Relations (SPPR)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,025,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOMB"><Rcn>106799</Rcn><Nid>9658</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Magneto-optics of layered materials: exploring many-body physics in electronic systems with unconventional bands</Name><PI>Marek Potemski</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The project will explore many-body physics in emergent quantum Hall effect systems (graphitic layers and surface states of topological insulators) and in layered metals of transition metal dichalcogenides using magneto-optical spectroscopy - unconventional for this purpose, but uniquely applicable to these unconventional systems.

The project will focus on three areas: -- (i) detailed angular momentum transfer due to non-axisymmetric features, such as bars and spirals, in early galaxies, submitted to internal dynamical processes, but also external matter accretion --- (ii) census of angular momentum exchanges during galaxy interactions, transformation from orbital to internal spin, and exchange between the various components, role of the environment on the density of angular momentum, through cosmic filaments, and formation of large-scale structures  --  (iii) efficient fueling of super-massive black holes (SMBH) in the early universe, through angular momentum transfer, and study of complex feedback processes, in particular around bright cluster galaxies, at the centre of cooling flows.

It has not proven possible to break through into a new regime of complexity to date because of the intrinsically probabilistic character of the feasible network operations. In this proposal, we overcome this bottleneck. Our approach will integrate robust, simple, broadband photonic quantum memories together with novel pure-state light sources fabricated in precise 3-D photonic structures, coupled to integrated, highly-efficient photon-number-resolving detectors. Deterministic photon-photon interactions will be engendered either by measurement and storage or by nonlinear interactions in the memory made possible by coherent quantum feedback control. This will deliver a multi-node array of synchronized conditional quantum operations, novel quantum light-matter interactions and distillation of high-quality entangled states. The outcome of this project will be a viable means to explore new regimes of many-body quantum physics, with impact on information processing, including multi-particle quantum simulation, multiparty quantum repeaters, multimode quantum sensors and elementary quantum computing."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,738,404</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MOSILSPIN"><Rcn>93432</Rcn><Nid>12297</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Modeling Silicon Spintronics</Name><PI>Siegfried Selberherr</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The breath taking increase in performance of integrated circuits became possible by continuous miniaturization of CMOS devices. On this exciting path many tough problems were resolved; however, growing technological challenges and soaring costs will gradually bring scaling to an end. This puts foreseeable limitations to the future performance increase, and research on alternative technologies and computational principles becomes important. Spin attracts attention as alternative to the charge degree of freedom for computations and non-volatile memory applications. Silicon as main material of microelectronics is characterized by negligible spin-orbit interaction and zero-spin nuclei and should display long spin coherence times. Combined with the potentially easy integration with CMOS, long spin coherence makes silicon perfectly suited for spin-driven applications, as confirmed by recent impressive demonstrations of spin injection, coherent propagation, and detection. The success of microelectronics technology has been well assisted by smart Technology Computer-Aided Design tools; however, support for spin applications is entirely absent. The objective here is to create, test, and apply a simulation environment for spin-based devices in silicon. Microscopic models describing the physical properties relevant to the spin degree of freedom are developed. Special attention will be paid to investigate, how to increase the spin coherence time. One option is based on completely removing the valley degeneracy in the conduction band by [110] uniaxial stress. Understanding spin-polarized transport in silicon and in compatible hysteretic materials allows using the spin-torque effect to invent, model, and optimize prototypes of switches and memory cells for the 21st century."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,678,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MPOES"><Rcn>89162</Rcn><Nid>9096</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Mathematical Physics of Out-of-Equilibrium Systems</Name><PI>Antti Jukka Kupiainen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The purpose of the project is to develop  new tools for a mathematical analysis of out of equilibrium systems. My main goal is a rigorous proof of Fourier's law for a Hamiltonian  dynamical system. In addition I plan to study various fundamental problems related to transport in such systems.

This set includes discrete and continuous  wave equations, non-linear Schr&#195;&#182;dinger equation and coupled chaotic systems.   I believe mathematical progress can be made in two cases: weakly nonlinear systems and strongly chaotic ones.  In the former class I propose to study the kinetic limit and corrections to it, anomalous conductivity in low dimensional systems, interplay of disorder and nonlinearity and weak turbulence.  In the latter class my goal is to prove Fourier's law. The methods will involve a map of the Hamiltonian problem to a probabilistic one dealing with random walk in a random environment and an application of rigorous renormalization group to study the latter.   I believe the time is ripe for a breakthrough in a rigorous analysis of transport in systems with conservation laws.

It studies what happens when we apply the principles of quantum  mechanics to problems in computer science and information processing. This has resulted in many unexpected discoveries and opened up new frontiers.

Quantum algorithms (such as Shor&#226;&#128;&#153;s factoring algorithm) can solve computational problems that are intractable for conventional computers.  Quantum mechanics also enables quantum cryptography which provides an ultimate degree of security that cannot be achieved by conventional methods. These developments have generated an enormous interest both in building a quantum computer and exploring the mathematical foundations of quantum information.

We will study computer science aspects of QIS. Our first goal is to develop new quantum algorithms and, more generally, new algorithmic techniques for developing quantum algorithms. We will explore a variety of new ideas: quantum walks, span programs, learning graphs, linear equation solving, computing by transforming quantum states.

Secondly, we will study the limits of quantum computing. We will look at various classes of computational problems and analyze what are the biggest speedups that quantum algorithms can achieve. We will also work on identifying  computational problems which are hard even for a quantum computer. Such problems can serve as a basis for cryptography that would be secure against quantum computers.

Thirdly, the ideas from quantum information can lead to very surprising connections between different fields. The mathematical methods from quantum information can be applied to solve purely classical (non-quantum) problems in computer science. The ideas from computer science can be used to study the complexity of physical systems in quantum mechanics. We think that both of those directions have the potential for unexpected breakthroughs and we will pursue both of them."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,360,980</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MULTIAX"><Rcn>110666</Rcn><Nid>8844</Nid><HI>Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland</HI><Name>MULTIAX: Multiaxial and Multiscale Plasticity in Metals</Name><PI>Helena Van Swygenhoven</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our ambition is to probe the influence of non-proportional multiaxial straining on the multiscale aspects of metal plasticity with focus on three deformation mechanisms: dislocation plasticity in bcc metals, mechanical twinning in fcc metals and the martensitic phase transformation. These mechanisms play a key role in modern TWIP and TRIP steels, yet about their response to multiaxial loading not much is known.
The underlying hypothesis of this research project is that by performing biaxial deformation tests at the micro-, meso- and macro-scale meanwhile following the microstructure insitu, ground-breaking insight can be obtained on how a second strain path, a change in strain path with or without prior unloading affects the operation of the deformation mechanism, the defect accumulation and as a consequence, the evolving microstructure.
The expected outcome of the research will help the formulation of criteria to be implemented in micromechanical models, for which constitutive equations are now relying solely on a knowledgebase derived from uniaxial testing.
Operationally, the project contains a development phase and a research phase. First a micro- and meso-scale biaxial test rig will be developed, allowing deforming small samples in two orthogonal directions independently, compatible to be installed at various Xray beamlines of synchrotron facilities in Europe and in SEMs. The research phase will be multiscale: the response of each deformation mechanism will be investigated at the level of the mechanism itself, at the level of an oligocrystal focusing on transmission of strain across grain boundaries and at the macrosopic level focussing on the evolution of the microstructure.

Such combs have become enabling tools for a growing tree of applications, from optical atomic clocks to attosecond science.
Recently, the millions of precisely controlled laser comb lines produced with a train of ultrashort laser pulses have been harnessed for highly multiplexed molecular spectroscopy.
Fourier multi-heterodyne spectroscopy with frequency combs is emerging as a powerful new spectroscopic tool. Cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy with two frequency
combs just demonstrated a dramatically improved sensitivity, compared to conventional Fourier spectroscopy, with recording times shortened from seconds to microseconds.
Such capabilities open exciting opportunities for instantaneous trace gas analysis, time-resolved spectroscopy of short-lived molecular species, precision spectroscopy and
hyperspectral imaging. Moreover, since frequency combs involve intense ultrashort laser pulses, nonlinear interactions can be harnessed, such as saturation or coherent transient
phenomena including photon echoes, in analogy to multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Envisioned applications range from optical labeling for the simplification and
disentanglement of complex spectra to coherent control for the selective microscopic imaging of unlabeled biomolecules.
Such new spectroscopic methods will be initially explored with state-of-the-art frequency comb sources, based on femtosecond fiber lasers and nonlinear conversion.

Turbulence is also key to applications, from industrial design and energy generation to climate dynamics, where the worst uncertainties are often due to its modelling.  Its practical computation and control have been hindered by empirical models and boundary conditions, in large part because of insufficient understanding of the multiscale transfer just mentioned. Direct simulations, without approximation, are expensive, but the past few years have seen the appearance of larger computers and reasonably-priced disks that allow, for the first time, the compilation of time-resolved  data sets of canonical turbulent flows with high enough Reynolds numbers to be truly multiscale, as well as the possibility of performing conceptual experiments on them.  The premise of this proposal is that  those new capabilities should allow us to elucidate, once and for all, the physics underlying the multiscale transfer processes in turbulence in the next five years, especially in shear flows near walls.  That will allow the formulation of more realistic engineering models, but the immediate goal of the proposal is to answer the fundamental questions that have resisted two centuries of attack by physicists and engineers.

The goal of this project is to synergize asymptotic imaging, stochastic modelling, and analysis of both deterministic and stochastic wave propagation phenomena.

MultiThermMan will move beyond the unsustainable worst-case design practices adopted in traditional thermal planning and reactive thermal management. We propose to integrate thermal-aware platform design, thermal control with workload management and shaping in a distributed, multi-scale strategy. This would enable to dynamically adjust the operating mode and active cooling control of each component in complex computing platforms to achieve the highest performance compatible with temperature constraints. The development of a synergistic performance, power and thermal management strategy requires major breakthroughs in several areas, namely architectures, run-time systems, resource management middleware, code optimization tools and programming models.

The project builds on recent international developments in the field of nonlinear waves led by the co-investigators that have shown how analogies between optical systems and the deep ocean provide new insights into the generation of the infamous hydrodynamic rogue waves on the ocean.  These results, which have led to the first experimental confirmation in 2010 of analytic predictions of hydrodynamics that have remained untested for 25 years, have now opened up the possibility for an optical system to directly study the dynamics and statistics of extreme nonlinear wave shaping.  This is a tremendous advance comparable to the introduction of optical systems to study chaos in the 1970s, and the co-investigators aim to be at the forefront of this research effort.  Core theoretical elements in the project will uncover the fundamental mechanisms underlying the emergence of large scale coherent structures from a turbulent environment, and resolve basic questions of energy transport in the presence of nonlinearity. These analytical studies will be complemented by numerical simulations and laboratory experiments in optical systems.

very long coherence times. The realization of a quantum computer ranks among the foremost
outstanding problems in physics, particularly in light of the revolutionary rewards
the achievement of this goal promises.
The proposed theoretical study is multi-dimensional. On the methodological side the
multi-dimensionality is in the breadth of the studies we discuss, ranging all the way from
phenomenology to mathematical physics. We will aim at detailed understanding of present
and future experimental results. We will analyze experimental setups designed to identify,
characterize and manipulate non-abelian states. And we will propose and classify novel
non-abelian states. On the concrete side, the multi-dimensionality is literal. The systems
we consider include quantum dots, one dimensional quantum wires, two dimensional planar
systems, and surfaces of three dimensional systems.
Our proposal starts with Majorana fermions in systems where spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman
fields and proximity coupling to superconductivity are at play. It continues with &#226;&#128;&#156;edge
anyons&#226;&#128;&#157;, non-abelian quasiparticles residing on edges of abelian Quantum Hall states. It
ends with open issues in the physics of the Quantum Hall Effect.
We expect that this study will result in clear schemes for unquestionable experimental
identification of Majorana fermions, new predictions for more of their measurable consequences,
understanding of the feasibility of fractionalized phases in quantum wires, feasible
experimental schemes for realizing and observing edge anyons, steps towards their classification,
and better understanding of quantum Hall interferometry.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,529,107</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MUSICOS"><Rcn>111506</Rcn><Nid>10087</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>MUSE Imaging of the Cosmic Web &#226;&#128;&#147; Ultra-Deep Observations of Intergalactic and Circumgalactic Gas</Name><PI>"Roland, Marie" Bacon</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project aims at making major advances in our understanding of galaxy formation through the direct detection and spectroscopic mapping of gas outside of galaxies at high redshifts.

The instrument will arrive at the observatory in mid 2013 and soon after begin with the buildup of a revolutionary set of &#226;&#128;&#156;spectroscopic deep fields&#226;&#128;&#157;, which will constitute a significant fraction of the 255 nights of observing time granted to the MUSE consortium in return for their investment.
The focus of this ERC proposal is the study of the gaseous environments of galaxies, and their links to the general inter&#194;&#172;galactic medium. Observationally it is extremely difficult to trace the inferred gas flows, because of their low predicted surface brightnesses and filamentary geometry. Only MUSE will have the sensitivity to detect and map them directly, through the Ly&#206;&#177; emission line of recombining hydrogen. MUSE will also provide spectroscopic (kinematic) constraints on these gas flows, which will be essential for quantitative comparisons with numerical simulations.
A dedicated team will address the many challenges of this scientific endeavor in a comprehensive way. It will involve the characterization of the instrument and its systematics; the development of advanced data reduction and data analysis tools in a coordinated multidisciplinary approach, involving astronomers as well as experts in image and signal processing; and the interpretation of the results in conjunction with the latest high-resolution cosmological simulations.

In this project, we want to explore four key physical questions opened by this new approach. First we plan to explore the limit of ultra-strong coupling in our systems, including the emission of Casimir-like squeezed vacuum photons upon non-adiabatic change in the coupling energy and parametric generation of light. Secondly we would like to test a theoretical prediction anticipating, in the ultra-strong coupling regime, a quantum phase transition to a Dicke superradiant state upon substitution of the GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas by a graphene layer or multilayers.

This wealth of information about our Galaxy&#226;&#128;&#153;s stellar body holds the key to understanding how disk galaxies form and how dark matter acts on the scales of galaxies. Ongoing surveys have recently hundred-folded the number of stars with good distance estimates, radial and transverse velocities and abundance estimates; and this only forebodes the data wealth expected from ESA&#226;&#128;&#153;s Gaia mission. Yet, practical approaches to extract the enormous astrophysical information content of these data have been sorely underdeveloped. Just within the last year, the PI and his collaborators have pioneered how to construct rigorously both mass density and kinematic maps of the Milky Way's stellar disk from existing spectroscopic surveys. It is proposed here to unleash the full potential of this approach.

This proposal builds on the PI's unique track record encompassing both extensive survey data analysis and detailed dynamical modeling, combined with his role in proprietary key data sets for this project. Focusing a group of experienced post-docs and PhD students for five years on these challenges will bring the critical mass in one single place to implementing such a comprehensive data/modeling machinery. The first years of the project will focus on the technique development and applications to ground-based data.

In principle, but so far without any demonstration, even heavy objects can exhibit the distinguished properties of quantum world particles. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) challenged a particular prediction of quantum theory saying that two particles can exist in a so-called entangled state in which the two particles do not have individually defined (&#226;&#128;&#152;local&#226;&#128;&#153;) positions and momenta. Most interestingly, the existence of entangled states was subsequently fully confirmed in experiments with photons and atoms.
The new project MassQ aims to test and to confirm quantum theory in the macroscopic world of massive, human-world sized objects by realizing an EPR entanglement experiment with heavy mirrors. Two kg-sized mirrors will be cooled to low temperature and their centre of mass motion driven by radiation pressure of intense laser light in such a way that the mirrors will lose their individually defined positions and momenta. As a result, their joint motion will form a unified massive quantum object.
This project will realize a fundamental test of quantum theory in the so far unexplored regime of human-world sized objects. Recent advances in gravitational wave detector research and in opto-mechanics make this project feasible. The vision of this project points even further into the future. This project aims to lay the basis for a completely new class of physics experiments. Mirrors with kilogram masses have a proper gravitational field and cause a space-time curvature in their vicinity. This way, in principle, the dynamics of two heavy entangled mirrors need to be described not only by quantum theory but also by general relativity. Today it is completely unclear what the results of such a new class of physics experiments will be. Undoubtedly, they are important to illuminate the deep connection between the two most successful theories in physics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,566,210</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MassTeV"><Rcn>88842</Rcn><Nid>12941</Nid><HI>European Organization For Nuclear Research, Switzerland</HI><Name>Mass hierarchy and particle physics at the TeV scale</Name><PI>Ignatios Antoniadis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The research goal of this proposal is the investigation of the most fundamental aspects of particle physics models and gravity at high energies, and establishing the connection between these findings and experiments. The main fundamental questions that will be addressed are: What is the origin of mass for the mediators of the weak interactions and its connection with the masses of quarks and leptons? Why this mass is hierarchically different from the Planck scale which makes gravity so weak compared to the other three known fundamental interactions described by the current Standard Model of particle physics? Why this enormous mass hierarchy is quantum mechanically stable? What is the theory that describes physical laws at TeV energies which will be explored in the near future by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN? These questions are at the very frontier of knowledge of theoretical particle physics and phenomenology and their intersection with gravity and string theory.   All members of the proposed research team have made breakthrough contributions in putting forward and developing new ideas that dominated such a research during the past 10 years. Although there is a certain overlap in the interests, each member brings a different unique expertise to the research, which will strongly resonate with the other members activity. Obviously, this project is strongly correlated with LHC physics confronting theoretical predictions with observations and using experimental data for building new theories and correcting existing models. In such an intense dynamical process, participation of doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers will be absolutely crucial and their active involvement is an essential component of the project.

The physician is now faced with a formidable overflow of information, especially when a  time dimension is added to the already hard to integrate 3-D spatial, multimodal and multiscale dimensions of modern medical images. This increasingly hampers the early detection and understanding of subtle image modifications which can have a vital impact on the patient's health.

To change this situation, this proposal introduces a new generation of computational models for the  simulation and analysis of  dynamic medical images. Thanks to their generative nature, they will allow the construction of databases of  synthetic, realistic medical image sequences simulating various evolving diseases, producing an invaluable new resource for training and benchmarking. Leveraging on their principled  biophysical and statistical foundations, these new models will bring a remarkable  added clinical value after they are personalized with innovative methods to fit the medical images of any  specific patient.

By explicitly revealing the underlying evolving biophysical processes observable in the images, this approach will yield  new groundbreaking image processing tools to correctly interpret the patient's condition (computer aided  diagnosis), to accurately predict the future evolution (computer aided prognosis), and to precisely simulate and monitor an optimal and personalized therapeutic strategy (computer aided therapy).  First applications will concern high impact diseases including brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia and will open new horizons in computational medical imaging.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,327</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MiCE"><Rcn>102289</Rcn><Nid>10586</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Microflow in Complex Environments</Name><PI>Julia Mary Yeomans</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>We will study the way in which the hydrodynamics of simple, complex and active fluids is affected by their environment, in particular by patterned surfaces and by confinement. We shall concentrate on micron and nanometric length scales where surfaces are often key in controlling fluid behaviour. The work is driven by current rapid and exciting advances in fabricating micropatterned substrates and by new experimental techniques probing the flow properties of fluids at these scales. Our work will be primarily computational and theoretical, but with an experimental component within Oxford, and with close experimental links to several groups internationally.

The systems we will concentrate on are:

1. simple fluids at micropatterned substrates: We aim to understand interface pinning, particularly on anisotropic surfaces, and superhydrophobic hydrodynamics. The knowledge will be used to help design devices, such as displays and condensers that exploit fluid-surface interactions at the mesoscale.

2. complex fluids in confinement and at patterned substrates: We shall concentrate on the f-d virus as a highly monodisperse system of colloidal rods which shows lyotropic liquid crystalline ordering. A close collaboration between experiment and simulation will investigate the interplay between elasticity, surface anchoring, flow, topological defects and interface instabilities.

3. active fluids at surfaces: Our aim is to understand low Reynolds number swimming in the vicinity of rough surfaces and in confined systems such as microchannels and fluid drops. Microswimmers provide an experimentally and theoretically accessible example of non-equilibrium statistical physics and have a range of striking behaviours, including clustering, low Reynolds number turbulence and anomalous flow field statistics, that remain exciting challenges.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,583,887</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MicroMotility"><Rcn>111287</Rcn><Nid>11514</Nid><HI>Scuola Internazionale Superiore Di Studi Avanzati Di Trieste, Italy</HI><Name>Multiscale modeling and simulation of biological and artificial locomotion at the micron scale: from metastatic tumor cells and unicellular swimmers to bioinspired microrobots</Name><PI>Antonio De Simone</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The project addresses the mechanical bases of cell motility by swimming and crawling, and the possibility of replicating the principles behind them in artificial systems.

The goals are to elucidate some key mechanisms governing bio-locomotion. In particular, actin- based motility of crawling cells and motility by swimming of unicellular organisms will be studied both in general and with reference to concrete model systems.

The study of biological examples of swimming and crawling motility will be used to produce a prototype of a micron-scale bio-inspired motile micro-robot exploiting the miniaturization that becomes possible from the extensive use of active materials.

This is a multi-disciplinary research project. The themes arise from the Mechanics of Soft and Bio- logical Matter. The methods are those of Computational Engineering, and take advantage of innovative techniques from Applied Mathematics. The planned research activities rest on the development of new tools and methods in mathematical modeling, numerical simulation, data acquisition on biological systems, and on the construction of prototype devices.

Furthermore, given the many recent advances in genetic engineering, viral targeting, and immunohistochemical labeling of specific cellular structures, there is a growing need for automated quantitative assessment of neuron morphology and connectivity. Electron microscopes can now provide the nanometer resolution that is needed to image synapses, and therefore connections, while Light Microscopes see at the micrometer resolution required to model the 3D structure of the dendritic network. Since both the arborescence and the connections are integral parts of the brain's wiring diagram, combining these two modalities is critically important. In fact, these microscopes now routinely produce high-resolution imagery in such large quantities that the bottleneck becomes automated processing and interpretation, which is needed for such data to be exploited to its full potential. We will therefore use our Computer Vision expertise to provide not only the necessary tools to process images acquired using a specific modality but also those required to create an integrated representation using all available modalities. This is a radical departure from earlier approaches to applying Computer Vision techniques in this field, which have tended to focus on narrow problems. State-of-the-art methods have not reached the level of reliability and integration that would allow automated processing and interpretation of the massive amounts of data that are required for a true leap of our understanding of how the brain works. In other words, we cannot yet exploit the full potential of our imaging technology and that is what we intend to change.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,982</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MicroNanoTeleHaptics"><Rcn>96859</Rcn><Nid>9959</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Micro/Nano Exploration, Manipulation and Assembly: Telehaptics and Virtual Reality System Development and Investigation of Biomechanics and Neuroscience of Touch</Name><PI>Mandayam Anandanpillai Srinivasan</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The primary objective of the proposed project is to develop robot mediated human interface technologies to manually explore, manipulate and assemble progressively smaller objects ranging from micro- to nano-meter scales and a secondary objective is to demonstrate the power of the interface system in the investigation of the fundamental mechanics and neural mechanisms of touch.

This brings to light, out of the huge, inconsistent Web ocean, an important body of knowledge that would otherwise not be attainable. Crowd-based data sourcing democratizes data-collection, cutting companies and researchers reliance on stagnant, overused datasets, and has great potential for revolutionizing our information world. Yet, triumph has so far been limited to only a handful of successful projects such as Wikipedia or IMDb. This comes notably from the difficulty of managing huge volumes of data and users of questionable quality and reliability. Every single initiative had to battle, almost from scratch, the same non-trivial challenges. The ad hoc solutions, even when successful, are application specific and rarely sharable.

In this project we propose to develop solid scientific foundations for Web-scale data sourcing. We believe that such a principled approach is essential to obtain knowledge of superior quality, to realize the task more effectively and automatically, be able to reuse solutions, and thereby to accelerate the pace of the absorption of this new technology that is revolutionizing our life. Our goal is very ambitious. We will develop the logical, algorithmic, and methodological foundations for the management of large scale crowd-sourced data and for the development of applications over such information. This encompasses a formal model capturing all the diverse facets of crowd-sourced data. This also means developing the necessary reasoning capabilities for managing data sourcing, cleaning, verification, integration, sharing, querying and updating, in a dynamic Web environment.

They are decisive for life processes and catalysis. More recently the pertaining coordination interactions were used to assemble discrete nanostructures and supramolecular networks. Here we aim at a rationale for the design of metallosupramolecular architectures in intimate contact with solid supports. We study and control individual functional molecules and their metal-directed assembly at well-defined surfaces in exquisite detail by molecular-level scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The atomistic insight gained into the underlying mechanisms and interactions is used to steer the formation of nano-architectures, whose physicochemical properties are characterized by local and space-averaging techniques. We rationalize the full involvement of the surface atomic lattice in the metal-ligand interactions and coordination spheres using advanced spectroscopic techniques and complementary ab initio theoretical calculations. We engineer nanoporous coordination networks with tailored cavities for patterning purposes, confinement and host-guest systems. We develop new concepts for controled molecular motion in nanoscale coordination environments. We explore the redox chemistry and catalytic activity of the presented coordinatively unsaturated sites to develop novel single-site heterogenous catalysts and potentially biomimetic systems. It is suggested that with the described research a novel heading in coordination chemistry can be explored.

One exciting new possibility is that of spintronics: electronic devices using the electron spin to carry and manipulate information. So far, spintronics has been explored in metals and semiconductors. Magnetic molecules in principle enable radically new approaches in using the spin degree of freedom, but their incorporation in solid-state devices is a daunting task. In particular, the main challenge is to control their spin for storing and reading information. We propose to use electric fields and light for this purpose.

Based on our recent breakthroughs in making nanoscale junctions of noble metals and graphene, we will fabricate and study planar spin transistors built up from individual magnetic molecules or nanoparticles. A key device feature is that electrodes are separated by a distance on the scale of the molecular object itself. This geometry allows for in-situ application of strong local electric fields as well as optical fields to modify magnetic states and hence influence the conductance.

The objective of this proposal is to study how the electric conductance through single molecules and nanoparticles can be used to probe their magnetic properties and how external stimuli can control them. We will perform proof-of-principle experiments divided into four challenging tasks: 1) Study of quantum aspects of transport through single magnetic molecules and nanoparticles; 2) Room-temperature studies of molecular magnetism on the molecular scale; 3) Measurement of spin-polarized currents through molecular-scale magnetic junctions; and 4) Control of molecular magnetism by local electric and optical fields.

By obtaining a detailed understanding of the interplay between molecular magnetism and transport we strive to establish new strategies towards in-situ spin-state control and the development of novel spintronic nanodevices.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,747</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MoltenEarth"><Rcn>102085</Rcn><Nid>10427</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Fluid Silicates at Extreme Conditions and the Magma Ocean</Name><PI>Lars Peter Stixrude</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Partial melting of silicates dominates the chemical evolution of Earth today and was even more important in Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s earlier history.

Dense gas solid flows are notoriously complex and its phenomena difficult to predict. This finds its origin in the large separation of relevant scales: particle-particle and particle-gas interactions at the microscale (&amp;lt; 1 mm) dictate the phenomena that occur at the macroscale (&amp;gt; 1 meter), the fundamental understanding of which poses a huge challenge for both the scientific and technological community. This proposal is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of large-scale dense gas-solid flow based on first principles, that is, based on the exchange of mass, momentum and heat at the surface of the individual solid particles, below the millimeter scale. To this end, we employ a multi-scale approach, where the gas-solid flow is described by three different models. Such an approach is by now widely recognized as the most rigorous and viable pathway to obtain a full understanding of dense-gas solid flow, and has become very topical in chemical engineering science. The unique aspect of this proposal is the scale and the comprehensiveness of the research: we want to consider, for the first time, the exchange of heat, momentum and energy, and the effects of polydispersity, heterogeneity, and domain geometries, at all three levels of modeling, and validated by one-to-one experiments. These generated insight and models will be extremely relevant for the design and scale-up of industrial equipment involving dispersed particulate flow, which is currently a fully empirical process, involving expensive and time-consuming experimentation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Multiturbulence"><Rcn>106986</Rcn><Nid>9567</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Fractal-generated fluid flows: new flow concepts, technological innovation and fundamentals</Name><PI>John Christos Vassilicos</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The unprecedented requirements set by the
dramatically evolving energy, environmental and climatic constraints
mean that industry needs new turbulent and vortical flow concepts for
new flow-technology solutions. The full potential and economic impact
of radically new industrial flow concepts can only be realised with a
step change (i) in the ways we generate and condition turbulent and
vortical flows and (ii) in our understanding of turbulent flow
dynamics and the consequent new predictive approaches.
Fractal/multiscale-generated turbulent and vortical flows are a new
family of flow concepts which I have recently pioneered and which
hold the following double promise:

(1) as the basis for a raft of conceptually new technological flow
solutions which can widely set entirely new industrial standards: this
proposal focuses on energy-efficient yet effective mixing devices;
low-power highly-enhanced heat exchangers; high-performance wings for
UAVs, cars, wind turbines; and realistic wind-field design
technologies for wind tunnel tests of tall structures such as
supertall skyscrapers and wind turbines.

(2) As the key new family of turbulent flows which will allow
hitherto impossible breakthroughs in our theory and modelling of fluid
turbulence.

I propose to realise this double promise by a combined
experimental-computational approach which will use cutting edge High
Performance Computing (HPC) and high-fidelity simulations based on a
new code which combines academic accuracy with industrial versatility
and which is specifically designed to perform very efficient massively
parallel computations on HPC systems. I will run these simulations in
tandem with a complementary wide range of wind tunnel, water channel
and other laboratory measurements in a two-way interaction between
laboratory and computer experiments which will ensure validations and
breadth of results.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,317,265</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NANOANTENNAS"><Rcn>93964</Rcn><Nid>9899</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut De Ciencies Fotoniques, Spain</HI><Name>Nano-Optical Antennas for Tuneable Single Photon Super-Emitters</Name><PI>Niko Frans Van Hulst</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Nano-optical antennas allow to confine light on a truly nanometer scale. Indeed, my group recently demonstrated efficient funneling of incident far field to antenna hotspots, i.e. nano-focusing down to 25 nm, and achieved for the first time steering of the angular photon emission of a single molecule. These pioneering results on close encounters between nano-antennas and photon emitters pave the way to a regime of new physical phenomena: super-emission, gradient effects, breakdown of the dipole approximation, near-field spectra, single photon beaming, quantized plasmons and potentially strong coupling. These are exactly the novel effects I plan to explore. Specific objectives are: - Nano-optical control: positioning of single photon emitters at antenna hotspots with &lt; 10 nm accuracy by top-down fabrication, optical forces and chemical recognition. - Super-emission-focusing: boosting of emission to ps Rabi periods and unity quantum efficiency by resonant coupling to the nano-antenna. Photons will be beamed in an antenna dominated angular cone, which in reciprocity acts as the acceptance cone for super-focusing. - Coherent antenna control: by shaping the phase content of broad band fs pulses and tuning the antenna load by optically active materials, I will control nanoscale fields, both in the temporal and spatial domain. - Quantized plasmons: by coupling single photon emitters across a nano-antenna I will explore strong coupling and uncover the quantum nature of plasmons. This research aims for a profound understanding of the fundamental limits of optical control at the nanoscale. The new tuneable photon super-emitters and nano-hot-spots open several new horizons: controlled single photon sources for quantum-information; light harvesting; energy conversion; efficient bio-sensors; optical imaging with 10 nm resolution.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NANOCELLIMAGE"><Rcn>97390</Rcn><Nid>11783</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Ultrasmall Chemical Imaging of Cells and Vesicular Release</Name><PI>Andrew Ewing</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The long-term goal of this research is to establish the chain of molecular events associated with (1) neurotransmitter release at the single cell and subcellular level and (2) with cell differentiation and reprogramming.

The immediate goal therefore includes development of three chemical methodologies at the cutting edge of analytical chemistry: 1) the development of arrays of nanometer electrodes that can be used to spatially measure the release of easily oxidized substances across the cell surface; 2) to improve the combination of MALDI and cluster SIMS ion sources on an orthogonal QStar instrument to enable protein and glycoprotein analysis at the single whole cell level, lipid domain analysis at the subcellular level, and importantly, depth profiling; and 3) the application of information discovered at single cells and of the methods developed in goals 1 and 2 to an in vitro model of cell-to-cell communication and regeneration.

We propose a concept for the synthesis and processing of mono- and multilayered graphenes and of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are strips of graphene exhibiting a high aspect ratio. The key idea is the dehydrogenation (and planarization) of precursor molecules made from twisted benzene rings. Size and shape of the final graphenes will be chemically determined by the precursors themselves, which can be synthesized with great perfection. This elegant level of structural control of graphenes and GNRs discriminates our approach against existing literature efforts. Defined edges of GNRs are essential for creating finite electronic band gaps, since pristine graphene is a semimetal and thus not suitable for most electronic and optoelectronic applications. Graphenes at a size of several hundred nm will be targeted in solution, but mainly after deposition and transformation of the precursor molecules on substrate surfaces. The consequence is that we will apply and combine organic polymer synthesis and processing with methods of surface physics to create a new materials science of graphenes. Further characteristics of the work will include in-situ monitoring of chemical processes by scanning probe methods and interfacing of as-formed graphenes for in-situ measurements of charge carrier mobility and spin transport. Applications will be demonstrated for the construction of batteries, fuel cells, field effect transistors, and sensors. What we expect as key achievements will be the delineation of reliable structure-property relationships and improved device performance of graphene materials.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NANOGRAPH@LSI"><Rcn>110938</Rcn><Nid>11439</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Nanostructuring graphene and graphitic substrates for controlled and reproducible functionalization</Name><PI>Steven De Feyter</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Graphene is a new class of promising material with exceptional properties and thus warrants a plethora of potential applications in various domains of science and technology. However, due to intrinsic zero bandgap and inherently low solubility, a prerequisite for the use of graphene in several applications is its controlled and reproducible functionalization in a nanostructured fashion. Being a &#226;&#128;&#152;surface-only&#226;&#128;&#153; nanomaterial, its properties are extremely sensitive not only to chemical modification but also to noncovalent interactions with simple organic molecules. A systematic knowledge base for targeted functionalization of graphene still eludes the scientific community. The present experimental protocols suffer from important shortcomings. Firstly, graphene functionalization occurs randomly in solution based methods and there is scarcity of methods that can exert precise control over how and where the reactions/interactions occur. Secondly, due to random functionalization, producing reproducible samples of structurally uniform graphene and graphitic materials remains a major challenge. Lastly, a molecular level understanding of the functionalization process is still lacking which precludes systematic strategies for manipulation of graphene and graphitic materials.

NANOGRAPH@LSI aims to develop systematic experimental protocols for controlled and reproducible (covalent, non-covalent as well as the combination of both) functionalization of graphene and graphitic materials in a nanostructured fashion at the liquid-solid interface (LSI), along with the implementation of new nanoscale characterisation tools, targeting a broad range of applications in the fields of electronics, i.e. graphene bandgap engineering, sensing, and separation.

By tethering of appropriate ligands to the NPs, imprinted matrices for selective sensing, and signal-triggered NPs ""sponges"" for the selective uptake and release of substrates will be designed.

In this proposal, we will develop and then apply radically new tools that will enable groundbreaking progress in the field of vortex matter in superconductors and will be of great importance to condensed matter physics and nanoscience. We propose a new scanning magnetic imaging method based on self-aligned fabrication of Josephson junctions with characteristic sizes of 10 nm and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) with typical diameter of 100 nm on the end of a pulled quartz tip. Such  nano-SQUID on a tip  will provide high-sensitivity high-bandwidth mapping of static and dynamic magnetic fields on nanometer scale that is significantly beyond the state of the art. We will develop a new  washboard frequency dynamic microscopy  for imaging of site-dependent vortex velocities over a remarkable range of over six orders of magnitude in velocity that is expected to reveal the most interesting dynamic phenomena in vortex mater that could not be investigated so far. Our study will provide a novel bottom-up comprehension of microscopic vortex dynamics from single vortex up to numerous predicted dynamic phase transitions, including disorder-dependent depinning processes, plastic deformations, channel flow, metastabilities and memory effects, moving smectic, moving Bragg glass, and dynamic melting. We will also develop a hybrid technology that combines a single electron transistor with nano-SQUID which will provide an unprecedented simultaneous nanoscale imaging of magnetic and electric fields.

In particular, this proposal considers silicon nanowire and carbon nanotube technologies as replacement/enhancement of current silicon technologies. This proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research, unique in its kind. The broad objective of this proposal is to study system organization, architectures and design tools which, based on a deep understanding and abstraction of the manufacturing technologies, allow us to realize nanosystems that outperform current integrated systems in terms of capabilities and performance. Thus this proposal will address modelling of technological aspects, synthesis and optimization of information processing functions from high-level specifications into the nanofabric, and new design technologies for specific aspects of nanosystems including, but not limited to, sensing and interfacing with the environment. This proposal will address also cross-cutting design goals such as ultra-low power and high-dependability design, with the overall objective of realizing nanosystems that are autonomous (w.r. to energy consumption) and autonomic (i.e., self healing). The scientific novelty of this proposal stems from the use of a nanofabric, where computation, sensing and communication are supported by a homogeneous means as well as from the study of algorithmic tools for mapping high-level functions onto the nanofabric. The intrinsic benefit of this research is to provide a design flow that extends both the technological basis and the capabilities of integrated systems, thus strengthening the industrial European position in a key sector where disruptive innovation is key for survival. The extrinsic benefit of this research is to broaden the use of nanosystems to new domains, including mobile/distributed embedded systems, health/environment management, and other areas that are critical to our lives.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,594</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NANOforBIO"><Rcn>94006</Rcn><Nid>13066</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands</HI><Name>Nanostructures for biology</Name><PI>Cornelis Dekker</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>I propose to employ our advanced capabilities for nanofabrication to explore new biology at the single-molecule and single-cell level. I choose to specifically address two directions of intense scientific interest: (i) With my team I will develop and exploit solid-state nanopores for the study of real-time translocation of individual biomolecules. In the past few years, my group has attained a leading position in this field and we want to apply our advanced knowledge to push the technology and use it to resolve some pressing questions in cell biology and biotechnology. Specifically, we will explore screening of DNA-protein complexes at the single-molecule level, and we will build biomimetic nanopores to address the physical mechanism of selection and controlled molecular transport of the nuclear pore complex. (ii) We will use nanofabrication to create well-defined landscapes for bacteria. This will allow biophysical studies of the interaction between bacteria and their habitat with an unprecedented control of the spatial structure and habitat parameters. I strongly believe that this approach constitutes a major new tool to experimentally address a number of fundamental issues in the ecology and evolution of bacteria for the first time in a controlled environment. Additionally, it opens up a way to explore the biophysics of bacteria in confined space, where we will study a new bacterial phenotype in nanofabricated slits which we recently discovered.

Interestingly, the field of transition metal catalysis has been dominated by the relatively simple dogma that the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst is determined by the interplay between the metal and the ligands that are coordinated to the metal. By developing new ligands, new catalyst can be uncovered that display specific reactivity and selectivity. Nature on the other hand, uses a much larger tool-box to arrive at catalytic systems that are generally far more active and selective than the man-made catalysts.  Enzymes often use multimetallic sites, or multi functional groups that work in concert. Importantly, Enzymes are much larger than synthetic catalysts, and take advantage of the second sphere around an active site by 1) creating a sterically constrained cavity around it leading to entatic states, i.e. deformed intermediate states that lead to lower energy barriers to the product 2) positioning functional groups within the cavity to properly orient and activate the substrate, by lower the transition state via secondary interactions.
In the current proposal we control catalyst properties by encapsulation. Will will use isolated natural active sites (and models theirof) and install these in well-defined cavities and study their properties. Can we create a second coordination sphere such that we can get activities and selectivies similar to that of the original enzyme? For example, we aim for nitrogenase activity by putting isolated active sites in synthetic cages."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NCDFP"><Rcn>110297</Rcn><Nid>9226</Nid><HI>Universitat Des Saarlandes, Germany</HI><Name>Non-Commutative Distributions in Free Probability</Name><PI>Roland Speicher</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"We intend to study new directions in free probability theory with high potential to lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of random matrix models and operator algebras.

More specifically, the objective of the proposal is to extend our armory for dealing with non-commutative distributions and to attack some of the fundamental problems which are related to such distributions, like: the existence and properties of the limit of multi-matrix models; the isomorphism problem for free group factors, and more generally, properties of free entropy and free entropy dimension as invariants for von Neumann algebras.

The main directions are:
(i) classifying non-commutative symmetries and describing the effect of invariance under such quantum symmetries for non-commutative distributions; this will rely on our recent theory of easy quantum groups

Key challenges and novel technical approaches are:

1. To create energy harvesting nano-generators to convert vibrations into electrical energy in hostile environments (e.g. wireless sensors in near engine applications).

2. To enable broadband energy harvesting to generate electrical energy from ambient vibrations which generally exhibit multiple time-dependent frequencies.

3. To produce Curie-temperature tuned nano-structured pyroelectrics to optimise the electrical energy scavenged from temperature fluctuations. To further enhance the energy generation I aim to couple thermal expansion and pyroelectric effects to produce a new class of thermal energy harvesting materials and systems.

They help us to determine local atomic arrangements, element compositions as well as electronic structures. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) is the most powerful and widely accepted technique. However, until recently in-situ HRTEM did not show sufficient resolution to image changes on the atomic scale. In the last five years, my group has pioneered advanced specimen holders towards in-situ HRTEM. We have leading expertise in obtaining the high resolution in a range of controllable environments: temperatures, pressures, and liquids. In addition, combinations with other types of parallel measurements were pioneered, such as in-situ low-noise electrical characterization. Clearly it is indeed possible to operate the HRTEM as a nanolaboratory. It allows to really see what one is measuring. With this proposal I want to realize the equipment and methodology to perform nano-electrical measurements of nanostructures in-situ in a HRTEM. The NanoElectrical Measurements in a Transmission Electron Microscope (NEMinTEM) will be applied to nanostructures of a range of materials.  Furthermore the electron beam will be used to make well-controlled modifications of the nanostructure. The effects of these modifications on the electrical properties will be measured simultaneously.

Therefore, future coastal hazards, which are likely to be exacerbated by climate change, will result in massive socio-economic and environmental impacts. To develop informed coastal management strategies to mitigate such adverse impacts, robust large scale, long term forecasts of coastal change are urgently required. However, none of the currently adopted approaches for simulating large scale, long-term (LSLT) coastal change appear to be capable of producing robust forecasts.
The consideration of processes governing LSLT coastal morphodynamics at their operational scales presents similar challenges to those encountered in climate forecasting. The recognition of inter-scale process relationships and the scale aggregation challenge is conceptualised in a scale cascade concept.
State-of-the-art and new innovative field monitoring methods will be implemented over a 5 year period along a 20km stretch of the Holland coast to acquire unprecedented process information at different temporal and spatial scales. These data will then be used in conjunction with existing macro-scale field data and strategic process based numerical modelling to support the development of an original, generic, physics based scale-aggregated numerical model of LSLT coastal change.
Such an innovative physics based scale-aggregated approach to forecast LSLT coastal change has never been attempted, primarily due to lack of a clear vision and the non-availability of multi-scale field data. The development of the capability to robustly forecast LSLT coastal change will represent a &#226;&#128;&#152;world first&#226;&#128;&#153; achievement which will significantly advance the state-of-the-art of coastal engineering/science.

1. The development of a new approach overcoming the limitations of existing methods, to measure the chemical composition of ionized gas with unknown heavy element abundance ratios in high-redshift galaxies;

2. The combination of this approach with sophisticated models of the ultraviolet emission from young stellar populations, to allow differentiated constraints on the chemical composition of stars and gas;

3. The combination of these models with cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, to identify the spectral signatures of competing scenarios of early chemical evolution in observations of statistical samples of high-redshift galaxies;

4. The development of an integrated web service to allow the astronomical community at large to exploit these models to interpret observations of distant galaxies.

The spectral analysis tools developed in the framework of this project will open powerful new opportunities to probe the early star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies. Moreover, by allowing the consistent interpretation of stellar and nebular emission, these tools will provide valuable constraints on parameters such as the escape fraction of ionizing photons and hence the contribution by galaxies to the ionizing background.

In particular, the recently introduced biological concepts of neural clusters, neural cliques and sparse coding are exploited in order to devise original and efficient brain-inspired networks.

Being byproducts of electron interaction, they come in a few flavors:  (i) Downstream modes in composite edge channels of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) regime; (ii) Upstream modes in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime; and (iii) Zero energy Majorana states (localized or propagating quasi-particles), in non-abelian FQHE states and in 1d topological P-wave superconductors.  My main interests in neutral modes in the QHE regime are: (a) Their direct association with the nature of the wavefunction of the quantum state; (b) Being excited when a charge mode is being partitioned (say, by a quantum point contact), they may play a prime role in dephasing interference of quasi-particles due to the energy they rob (in the partitioning process).

First, we will study vanadium (V), which is analytically challenging because of its extreme composition but which could be immensely powerful for tracing changes in oxidation. The V isotopic composition of magnetite will be investigated as a proxy for oxidation state and to provide new constraints on the cause of precipitation of V rich magnetite ores in the world s biggest deposits.

Second, we will develop isotope geochemistry of fluid immobile elements. Titanium will be used to elucidate: (a) the fate of the lithosphere in convecting mantle; (2) mobility of immobile elements in sedimentary to metamorphic systems and (3) the scavenging history of seawater recorded in marine Fe-Mn crusts. Zirconium will be used with Ti to evaluate changes in physical weathering over time.

The link that will be advanced is the oceanic carbon system now and in the past and its relationship to climate change. The major focus will go into marine calcification, the building block of the skeletons and shells for a large number of marine organisms. This is a key research area because: (i) storage of carbon in oceanic deposits of calcium carbonate plays an important but  poorly understood role in controlling atmospheric CO2; (ii) trace element and isotopic compositions of marine calcifying organisms have been used for reconstructing environmental parameters to understand past changes in climate; (iii) increasing ocean acidification will lead to reduced calcification of modern ecosystems as well as enhanced dissolution of carbonate sediments that will play an increasingly important role in the future chemistry of  the ocean and its ability to take up atmospheric CO2.

Work on biomineralization and biomineralogy of marine calcifiers is expanding rapidly but is almost completely divorced from work on their use in palaeoceanography. Bringing these two aspects together has enormous potential and is a key goal of this proposal.

There are a large number of opportunities given recent breakthroughs in understanding, within this proposal and in the future. The most important are to (i) understand incorporation of proxies into foraminifera; (ii) produce accurate estimates of pH and CO2 over earth history on tectonic, orbital and rapid time scales; (iii) explain how changes in deep-sea storage of calcium carbonate affects atmospheric CO2; and (iv) develop research on evolution of ocean chemistry concurrent with biotic innovations."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,581,643</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEWMATS"><Rcn>88538</Rcn><Nid>13124</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>New Directions in Hybrid Inorganic-Organic Framework Materials</Name><PI>Anthony Kevin Cheetham</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The proposed work is in the field of inorganic-organic hybrid materials, focusing mainly on dense rather than nanoporous materials.

In recent years, many innovative ideas have been put forward to improve the sensitivity of \bbonu\ experiments. In general, these propositions have sought to increase the number of experimental signatures available to reject backgrounds while attempting to use isotopes and detector techniques which can be more easily scaled to large masses.

The objective of this project is to realize the NEXT experiment, an innovativedetector based on a high-pressure xenon gas (HPXe) TPC that will run at the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC), in Spain.

Our primary goal is to complete the construction and commissioning of a 150 kg HPXe TPC (NEXT-100) by 2014, and start a physics run in 2015 that can improve the present bound set by the EXO experiment and perhaps discover the Majorana nature of neutrinos. In addition, we will carry out an R\&amp;D program focused in demonstrating the scalability of the technology to the ton scale.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,791,771</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NLST"><Rcn>101263</Rcn><Nid>9781</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Nonlocality in space and time</Name><PI>Sandu Popescu</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Quantum mechanics is our most successful theory of nature. Yet more than eight decades after its inception there is a general agreement that a deep and intuitive understanding of it is still missing; we know how to compute quantum effects but we clearly do not have the full story. Even to this day, surprising and even paradoxical quantum effects continue to be frequently discovered. They are paradoxical only because our understanding of quantum behaviour is not yet good enough to have anticipated them.

However, for the first time there are glimmers of hope. It is the main thesis of this project that what makes quantum mechanics so counterintuitive is the fact that it is nonlocal.

One nonlocal phenomenon, namely Bell-type nonlocality, is at present investigated intensively. It is by now universally accepted that it holds at least part of the key to truly understanding quantum behaviour.

However, it is the main point of this project that there exist two other types of nonlocality, namely dynamic nonlocality and nonlocality in time. Dynamic nonlocality is the nonlocality of the quantum equations of motion, discovered in the context of the Aharanov-Bohm effect. Nonlocality in time is the ability to impose independent initial and final boundary conditions on the evolution of a quantum system. In contrast to Bell-type nonlocality, these two other types of nonlocality have received far less attention. Research into temporal-nonlocality (pre- and post-selection) has been evolving slowly over the last twenty years, whilst dynamical nonlocality has been virtually untouched. I believe that only by understanding all three types of nonlocality can the key to quantum behaviour be found.

This project will develop an intensive research program on dynamical and temporal nonlocality whilst pursuing a vigorous investigation into the many fundamental open questions related to Bell-type nonlocality."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,664,126</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NMNAG"><Rcn>93882</Rcn><Nid>9977</Nid><HI>Universite Pierre Et Marie Curie - Paris 6, France</HI><Name>New Methods in Non Archimedean Geometry</Name><PI>Francois Loeser</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>During the last decade, spectacular achievments have been completed in Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry and in Representation Theory by using powerful new tools provided by Motivic Integration and Berkovich spaces. We propose to develop a general framework for geometry over non archimedean valued field that will provide common foundations for Motivic Integration and Berkovich spaces. This will allow to broaden the range of potential applications. A main originality of our approach is the use of advanced tools from modern Model Theory, like definability and stable domination, together with methods from Algebraic Geometry. The relevance of Model Theory to non archimedean geometry may be illustrated as follows: geometry over valued fields ultimately combine geometry over the residue field and geometry over the value group. Model theorically these geometries correspond respectively to stable and o-minimal theories. These are of a very different nature and Model Theory provides unifying concepts allowing to treat them on equal footing. This approach will in particular allow us to solve several fundamental open questions on the tame nature of the topology of Berkovich spaces and should open new perspectives towards outstanding conjectures like the Monodromy conjecture. Our goal is also to use model theoretic tools in order to give new applications of Motivic Integration to Algebraic Geometry and Singularity Theory.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,541,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NMNP"><Rcn>88468</Rcn><Nid>11218</Nid><HI>Technion - Israel Institute Of Technology, Israel</HI><Name>Nonlinear Micro- and Nano-Photonics: nonlinear optics at the micrometer scale and below</Name><PI>Mordechai Segev</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We will investigate, experimentally and theoretically, the dynamics of nonlinear optical waves at mesoscopic scales, ranging from several wavelengths (~10 microns) down to the sub-wavelength regime (~0.2 microns). Our studies will cover a variety of optical settings: from various kinds of periodic systems (photonic lattices) with and without disorder, to bulk materials and nano-suspensions. Under proper conditions, light propagating nonlinearly in these systems can display complex nonlinear dynamics, giving rise to a variety of fascinating phenomena.   Perhaps the most intriguing are associated with the suspensions containing dielectric nano-spheres, upon which light acts, by virtue of the gradient force, to modify the local density of spheres, thereby varying the effective refractive index. We will use light to alter the properties of the fluid (e.g., surface-tension, viscosity), which, in turn, will affect the pattern of optical wave in space and time. We will study nonlinear optics coupled directly to nonlinear fluid dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate optically-induced convection and optically-driven waves in the fluid. In the same system, we will explore sub-wavelength optical spatial solitons. Our preliminary experimental results clearly show very narrow solitons, narrower than imaging optics can resolve.   In another effort, we will explore arrays of sub-wavelength waveguides with a sharp index contrast, and will study a variety of nonlinear phenomena unique to such structures.   Other efforts include linear and nonlinear wave phenomena in photonic lattices, such as Anderson localization of lightt, the optical realization of the famous Hofstadter butterfly, waves in honeycomb lattices exhibiting unique features arising from symmetry (diabolic points, Berry phase effects, backscattering, etc.), Anderson localization in quasi-crystals and in honeycomb structures, transport of solitons in random potentials, and more.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,100,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NOBLE"><Rcn>97878</Rcn><Nid>12770</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"The Origin, Accretion and Differentiation of Extreme Volatiles in Terrestrial Planets"</Name><PI>Christopher John Ballentine</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Identifying the processes by which the terrestrial planets acquired, retained and redistributed extreme volatile elements remains a fundamental science question.

We detail a Manchester innovation which enables halogens in these samples to be readily analysed.

We propose to: 1) Make the first direct experimental measurements of the partitioning behaviour of the halogens relevant to terrestrial mantle melting and planetesimal differentiation; 2) Establish the character of halogens available for accretion from chondrites; 3) Investigate the effect of planetesimal differentiation on the halogens from evolved meteorite glass/mineral systems; 4) Identify the role of massive impactors from lunar volcanic glasses; and 5) Identify the effect of planetary surface processes in the absence of life from alteration products in Martian meteorites.

On the Earth we will establish the first halogen mid ocean ridge and ocean island basalt halogen data base.  This will enable us to: 1) Characterise the respective mantle source halogen-noble gases; 2) Test models of volatile element recycling into the mantle by exploiting the high I/Cl of the ocean sediments caused by organic sequestration; 3) Identify whether the relationship between halogens and noble gases in subducted fluids (pilot data) is preserved in the mantle; 4) Use the mantle iodine concentration together with 129Xe as a tool to quantify the mass of dead iodine recycled into the respective reservoirs. 5) Identify or devise mantle convection and primordial reservoir source models compatible with the new data set."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,747,271</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NOGAT"><Rcn>97610</Rcn><Nid>11780</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>NOBLE GAS TRACING OF SOURCES AND SINKS OF VOLATILE ELEMENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE</Name><PI>Bernard Marty</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal has the objective to greatly enhance our understanding of sources, sinks and processes fixing the composition of the atmosphere at different time periods of time, from 3.8 Gyr ago to Present.

Such applications require the ability to acquire, reconstruct, analyze, and synthesize non-rigid three-dimensional shapes. These procedures pose challenging problems both theoretically and practically due to the vast number of degrees of freedom involved in non-rigid deformations. While modelling and analysis of non-rigid shapes has greatly advanced in the past decade, existing solutions are largely based on parametric models restricting the objects of interest to a narrow class of similar shapes. Broadly speaking, reconstruction, analysis, and synthesis of arbitrary deformable shapes remain unsolved problems, a practical solution of which would be a major milestone in computer vision and related fields. This proposal aims at answering these fundamental questions by adopting tools from modern metric geometry, a field of theoretical mathematics which in the past few decades has undergone a series of revolutions that remained largely unnoticed and unused in applied sciences. We believe that metric geometry tools could systematically answer these questions, and, coupled with modern numerical optimization techniques and novel hardware architectures, pave the computational way to the next generation in deformable shape analysis. We plan to develop such numerical tools while demonstrating their efficiency on several challenging real-life applications such as surgery prediction and planning, biometry, and computer-aided diagnosis."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,121,295</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NOTES"><Rcn>88540</Rcn><Nid>13129</Nid><HI>University Of Leeds, United Kingdom</HI><Name>New Opportunities in Terahertz Engineering and Science</Name><PI>Alexander Giles Davies</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Over the last 20 years, the study of mesoscopic quantum-confined electronic systems has revealed a wealth of exciting physics. The characteristic energy scale in many important mesoscopic devices such as two-dimensional electron systems, layered semiconductor structures, semiconductor quantum dots, and laterally-confined wires, dots, and other geometries, corresponds to the terahertz (THz) frequency range, which until recently has been difficult to access. Furthermore, invaluable information on the states and dynamics of carriers in condensed matter systems, not obtainable by other techniques, can potentially be accessed though the dynamic (high frequency) electronic response. My vision is to create a step-change in the study of mesoscopic electronic systems by developing and exploiting THz frequency technology to probe the THz frequency/picosecond response of quantum-confined electronic systems. I will develop quasi-optical guided-wave techniques to generate (and detect) single-cycle THz/picosecond electronic pulses adjacent to the mesoscopic system in a cryostat, avoiding the RC bandwidth-limiting problems inherent in previous high frequency (up to the GHz range) electrical measurements. In parallel, I will develop a series of original imaging and spectroscopy technologies based on the THz quantum cascade laser, including continuous wave coherent detection. These will be exploited in a range of proving projects, including phase-stepping interferometry, coherence-gated imaging and, ultimately, depth-resolved THz holography. This programme, comprising the symbiotic development of THz engineering and science, will be unique internationally and will open new opportunities and directions in the study and exploitation of THz frequency electronics and photonics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,542,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NOVGRAPHENE"><Rcn>103474</Rcn><Nid>11268</Nid><HI>Fundacion Imdea Nanociencia, Spain</HI><Name>Novel uses for graphene</Name><PI>Francisco Guinea Lopez</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Models for novel uses of graphene, not feasible in other materials, will be developed.

Complex nonlinear behaviours are ubiquitous in the life sciences, neuro-imaging and many other domains but the problems that these challenges raise are also fundamental in many other disciplines and problem domains. The study of complex systems that evolve as a function of time has received enormous attention over the last century and many important results have been established. While there is still much work to do to fully understand this class of systems recent results demonstrate that there is now a unique opportunity to significantly enhance and extend this purely temporal focus both to include nonlinear frequency domain analysis, and to derive results for the important class of spatio-temporal complex systems. The main aim of this proposal is to develop methods for the identification and analysis of the class of severely nonlinear systems, to develop complimentary nonlinear frequency domain identification and analysis methods, and to study the large class of systems that are defined by both spatial and temporal dynamics. In each case the aim is to develop core generic systems approaches that allow the construction of transparent models from recorded data sets that can be related back and analysed in terms of the components of the underlying system.

The phenomenon of particle-electrode impacts (PEI), due to Brownian collisions of NPs with an electrode held at a suitable potential, enables NPs to be individually addressed, chemically manipulated and interrogated via electrical contact during collisions.
We shall address experimental and theoretical aspects of PEI embracing the redox chemistry of metal, non-metal and organic nanoparticles; the use of tagged nanoparticles with tags varying from proteins/DNA (sensing applications) to organic moieties (synthesis and nanoarchitectures); the insertion chemistry of H, Li etc into metal and metal oxide NPs (with application to new battery materials); photoelectrochemistry of semiconducting and sensitised NPs; the aggregation of NPs, single molecule detection via electrochemistry, and controlling the impact environment via optimisation of the impact parameters for particular applications. Theoretical models will be developed to describe and predict the stochastic PEI phenomenon, including the testing of existing theories of electron transfer and transport to and from nanoscale electrodes (Frumkin and Levich exclusion effects).
We have pioneered early aspects of this fledgling field and are ideally placed to realise the full potential of PEI studies to a wide range of nanoelectrochemical, analytical, synthetic and sensing applications. We therefore request support for a comprehensive programme of work to expand and fully exploit the field, using the PEI phenomenon to advance the interfaces of electrochemistry with analytical chemistry, biochemistry, materials science and physics (offering myriad applications in synthesis, sensing, nanotechnology, batteries and solar cells) leading to a level of expertise and fundamental understanding prior to ambitious, world-leading experiments in nanoelectrochemistry and in analytical science.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,478,320</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoInspection"><Rcn>107824</Rcn><Nid>10862</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Near-Field Spectroscopic Imaging of the Assembly and Working of Nanosheets of Catalytic Porous Materials</Name><PI>Bert Marc Weckhuysen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The pressing need for a more sustainable society has sparked intensive research efforts in search for novel materials with controlled structure, porosity and functionalities. Such porous materials may combine high catalytic activity and selectivity with a long-term stability in the conversion of renewable (e.g. biomass) and non-renewable feedstock when producing future transportation fuels and chemicals. Rational design and optimization of the catalytic properties of these materials is one of the keys for the transition from a fossil fuels based society to a sustainable society.
Useful porous catalytic solids are still largely discovered through a combination of trial-and-error, serendipity and high-throughput testing, mainly because not much is known about the molecular details of their formation and working. Such knowledge is needed to tailor these porous solids towards optimal functioning.
My goal is to obtain fundamental insights in the formation and catalytic functioning of crystalline porous materials. Nano-sized sheets of porous materials will be constructed as model systems amenable to nano-spectroscopic research. We will explore Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Scanning Near-Field X-ray Microscopy as novel analytical tools in combination with a specially designed high-pressure/high-temperature in-situ Atomic Force Microscopy cell. In this way, Raman and X-ray spectra can be obtained at the nanoscale of e.g. a growing metal organic framework nanosheet. The novel tools and models will be used to study the chemistry of synthesis, self-assembly and catalysis. We will address catalyst stability by investigating catalyst corrosion in the presence of various polar molecules (water, alcohols, organic acids). It is expected that the new insights will make it possible to determine proper synthesis and reaction conditions leading to the assembly of improved catalytic porous materials, optimized for selective conversion of carbohydrates and lignin-related compounds.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoPaleoMag"><Rcn>106899</Rcn><Nid>11444</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Nanopaleomagnetism: a multiscale approach to paleomagnetic analysis of geological materials</Name><PI>Richard John Harrison</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Paleomagnetism has played a pivotal role in developing our modern understanding of the Earth, and remains one of the primary tools used to study the structure and dynamics of the Earth and other planets. However, some of the most interesting and controversial periods of Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s history occur far beyond the current limits of our confidence in the paleomagnetic signals used to study them. NanoPaleoMag will solve this problem by dramatically increasing the range of materials that are suitable for paleomagnetic study, thereby opening up periods of Earth history that have hitherto defied conventional paleomagnetic analysis.

Rocks are chemically, mineralogically, texturally and magnetically heterogeneous materials, with heterogeneity occuring at all length scales &#226;&#128;&#147; from metres to nanometres. There is a pressing need to push the spatial resolution of paleomagnetic studies beyond their current limits and to extend the analysis into 3D. Adopting cutting-edge techniques from physics and materials science, NanoPaleoMag will perform paleomagnetic measurements at submicron length scales. 3D measurements of the volume, shape and spacing of all magnetic particles within a microscale region of interest will be made using a focused ion beam workstation. Combined with high-resolution paleomagnetic measurements and nanometre/nanosecond electron/X-ray magnetic imaging, NanoPaleoMag will characterise the magnetic properties of geological materials at fundamental length scales and time scales. Sample-return missions to asteroids, comets, moons and planets will soon provide unprecedented opportunities for extraterrestrial paleomagnetism. NanoPaleoMag will provide the methodology and instrumentation needed to analyse these precious materials.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,384,543</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NanoPartCat"><Rcn>185394</Rcn><Nid>10753</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Supported Nanoparticles for Catalysis: Genesis and Dynamics in the Liquid Phase</Name><PI>Krijn Pieter De Jong</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Supported metal nanoparticles are used as catalysts to accelerate and steer chemical conversions to produce, e.g., transportation fuels, chemicals and medicines. Albeit of eminent importance, supported metal catalysts are almost exclusively synthesized in liquid-phase processes that are often considered &#226;&#128;&#152;an art rather than a science&#226;&#128;&#153;. Although recent results from our laboratory and others on the fundamentals of catalysts synthesis have led to many new insights, the lack of methodology to investigate directly the formation of supported nanoparticles in the liquid phase hampers progress.
The key objective of this proposal is to image and thereby obtain a detailed understanding of both the genesis (synthesis) and the dynamics (catalysis) of supported metal nanoparticles in the liquid phase with nanometer resolution and in real time. To this end we will combine two recent developments: (1) a liquid-phase in situ cell for use in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) with (2) the element specificity of a Chemi-STEM that provides element specific images with nanometer resolution.. In this way we will image in the liquid phase the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles on a support. As support we plan to use materials with ordered porosity that allow imaging of genesis of nanoparticles in liquid confined in nanopores. The key objective of this proposal will be addressed in four projects (1) acquisition and implementation of a liquid-phase cell within a Chemi-STEM which is then used to study (2) ion adsorption of noble metal complexes onto silica and zeolites followed by liquid-phase reduction to form metallic nanoparticles, (3) crystallization of metal nitrates in nanopores of silica and carbon, (4) dynamics of palladium nanoparticles in liquid-phase catalysis.
The new insights will move catalysts synthesis &#226;&#128;&#152;from art to science&#226;&#128;&#153; and provide control over the properties of supported nanoparticles to arrive at novel catalysts for sustainable processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Nanooxides"><Rcn>106928</Rcn><Nid>13011</Nid><HI>Universitaet Bielefeld, Germany</HI><Name>Nanosized porous molecular metal oxides with functionalizable cavities and soft matter behaviour allow studies of new phenomena</Name><PI>Achim M&#195;&#188;ller</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>It is generally accepted that nano materials &#226;&#128;&#156;will revolutionize our industries and our lives&#226;&#128;&#157; (Nobel laureate R.

These nano materials should now be adjusted regarding size, chemical composition, their linking to extended structures, and a variety of new tailored internal functionalities in order to get appropriate properties of interest for different purposes of nano science and technology.  Among the examples are: the protection/stabilization of intermediates and transport of the encapsulated materials after pore closing, systematic studies regarding the generation of hydrophobic cavities with and without water (of importance for protein research and even related to drug design), the removal of a variety of hydrophobic (potentially toxic) compounds from water based on molecular recognition (a paradigmatic shift) and finally, stepwise capsule closing and opening related to allosteric effects. The intended work on the capsules should open doors for the understanding of  phenomena in small spaces. Also materials based on the related wheel-shaped metal-oxides with unprecedented properties (i.e. soft matter behaviour) will be investigated.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,128,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NetSat"><Rcn>109748</Rcn><Nid>9300</Nid><HI>Zentrum Fuer Telematik E.v., Germany</HI><Name>Networked Pico-Satellite Distributed System Control</Name><PI>Klaus Schilling</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>A paradigm shift is emerging in spacecraft engineering from single, large, and multifunctional satellites towards cooperating groups of small satellites. This will enable innovative applications in areas like Earth observation or telecommunication. Related interdisciplinary research in the field of formation control and networked satellites are key challenges of this proposal.

Modern miniaturization techniques allow realization of satellites of continuously smaller masses, thus enabling cost-efficient implementation of distributed multi-satellite systems. In preparation my team has already realized two satellites at only 1 kg mass in the University W&#195;&#188;rzburg&#226;&#128;&#153;s Ex&#194;&#172;perimental satellite (UWE) program, emphasizing crucial components for formation flying, like communication (UWE-1, launched 2005), attitude determination (UWE-2, launched 2009), and attitude control (UWE-3, launched 2013).

My vision for the proposed project is to demonstrate formation control of four pico-satellites in-orbit for the first time worldwide. To realize this objective, innovative multi-satellite networked orbit control based on relative position and attitude of each satellite is to be implemented in order to enable Earth observations based on multipoint measurements. Related sensor systems used in my laboratory in research for advanced characterization of teams of mobile robots will be transferred to the space environment. Breakthroughs are expected by combining optimal control strategies for coordination of relative motion with a robust flow of information in the network of satellites and ground stations, implemented via innovative use of ad-hoc networks in space. Based on my team&#226;&#128;&#153;s expertise in implementing very small satellites, first time a system composed of four satellites will be launched to demonstrate autonomous distributed formation control in orbit. This research evaluation in space is expected to open up significant application potential for future distributed satellite system services in Earth observation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuroCMOS"><Rcn>99147</Rcn><Nid>8741</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Seamless Integration of Neurons with CMOS Microelectronics</Name><PI>Andreas Reinhold Hierlemann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We propose to seamlessly integrate advanced microelectronics and living neuronal cells in a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to significantly advance the understanding of neuronal behaviour.

Neuronal or retinal preparations, such as acute and organotypic brain slices (retinae) or primary cultured, dissociated cells, will be directly placed or grown atop dedicated CMOS microelectronics chips. The chips will feature multiple functions, since neurons carry and pass signals to each other using electro-chemical mechanisms: electrophysiological recording &amp; stimulation, in closed loop &amp; real time, as well as highly spatially resolved impedance measurements and detection of neuroactive chemical compounds. The chips will be capable of delivering any of these functions to arbitrarily selectable individual cells or even subcellular units, and, at the same time, of interacting with a multitude of cells or complete neuronal networks. Along with imaging (light, fluorescence), pharmacological, and/or genetic methods, the developed chip platform will be used to study neuronal network dynamics, synaptic and axonal plasticity, relevant for many brain diseases, as well as visual encoding in the retina. Efficient data handling and spike sorting algorithms will be developed to facilitate these investigations.

These reactive intermediates made now available new materials with outstanding physical properties, novel drugs with excellent activity spectra, modern highly efficient and ecologically benign agrochemicals. The goal of this work is the development of new synthetic routes and a practical access to polyfunctional organometallic reagents using affordable and non-toxic metals such as Mg, Al, Ti, Ca, Mn, and Fe. These new types of organometallics will find an extremely broad range of applications in contemporary organic synthesis. New advanced approaches to these reagents will be based on the recently discovered beneficial influence of environmentally friendly salts such as LiCl on the preparation of these reactive intermediates. Our experience will allow us to design organometallic reagents bearing practically all important functional groups used in organic synthesis. This work will lead to ground-breaking advances in main-group synthetic chemistry and make a broad range of completely novel organometallic compounds available for applications in industry. The availability of such intermediates will revolutionize from the point of view of economy and environmental impact the syntheses of important drugs, modern agrochemicals, as well as perspective compounds with new groundbreaking physical properties for sophisticated electronics and adjacent applications.

Combined with new ultra low frequency antennas (an extension to LOFAR here proposed), these new facilities will for the first time enable sensitive observations from the lowest possible frequencies accessible from the ground (~15 MHz) up to 1400 MHz. The guaranteed time projects (PI HR) to carry out ultra deep pointed observations and to survey the entire northern sky will be unique in terms of angular resolution, depth, and extremely large frequency range. This enables a coherent study of clusters of galaxies over the entire history of the universe up to the formation of the first proto-clusters.

Studies of the associated shock waves produced by cluster mergers and the magnetic field properties of the cluster gas will constrain models of the formation of galaxy clusters.The large field of views of both LOFAR  will enable the detection of radio emission from millions of star-forming galaxies up to z=2-3, at the epoch at which the bulk of galaxy formation is believed to have occurred. In combination with infrared surveys, the first significant sample of proto-clusters of galaxies will be obtained. This will enable the first complete study of the overall properties of proto-clusters and their galaxy contents.With LOFAR&#226;&#128;&#153;s ability to pinpoint radio sources with extremely steep radio spectra, we will detect radio galaxies at unprecedented distances. As our previous radio and optical investigations have established that distant radio galaxies are often located in proto-clusters, the most distant LOFAR radio galaxies would be excellent targets to locate and study the first proto-clusters close to or even at the epoch of reionisation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NewTURB"><Rcn>110812</Rcn><Nid>10172</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Roma Torvergata, Italy</HI><Name>New eddy-simulation concepts and methodologies for frontier problems in Turbulence</Name><PI>Luca Biferale</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Advances in transportation, energy harvesting, chemical processing, climatology, atmospheric and marine pollution are obstructed by the lack of understanding of turbulence. The turbulent energy transfer toward small-scales is characterized by highly non-Gaussian and out-of-equilibrium fluctuations that cannot be described by mean-field theories or traditional closure approximations. State-of-the-art computers and algorithms do not allow to perform brute-force direct numerical simulations of any realistic turbulent configuration:  modelling is mandatory. On the other hand,  turbulence models are often strongly limited by our lack of understanding of fundamental mechanisms. As a result, we have a deadlock:  turbulence is thought of as &#226;&#128;&#152;unsolvable&#226;&#128;&#153; theoretically and computationally &#226;&#128;&#152;intensive&#226;&#128;&#153;. Indeed, progress by using conventional methods has been slow. Last year, however, something new happened. Two unconventional conceptual and numerical  methodologies to study Navier-Stokes equations appeared based on: (i) a surgery of nonlinear interactions with different Energy and Helicity contents, (ii) a fractal-Fourier decimation. These unexplored tools are potential breakthroughs to unravel the basic mechanisms governing the turbulent transfer in isotropic, anisotropic and bounded flows, e.g. the mechanism behind the growth of small-scales vorticity and formation/stability of coherent structures, a challenge that has defeated all numerical and theoretical attempts, up to now. The ultimate goal of NewTURB is to integrate the fresh knowledge achieved by using these novel  numerical instruments to push forward the frontiers of  turbulence modelling, exploiting the possibility to reduce the number-of-degrees-of-freedom in an innovative way to deliver alternative frontier &#226;&#128;&#152;multiscale eddy-simulations&#226;&#128;&#153; methodologies for both unbounded and bounded flows with smooth walls or with heterogeneous landscapes, e.g. flows over a rough surface.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,986,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NoCO2"><Rcn>102606</Rcn><Nid>10358</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Novel combustion principle with inherent capture of CO2 using combined manganese oxides that release oxygen</Name><PI>Jan Anders Lyngfelt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Conventional CO2 capture processes have significant cost and energy penalties associated with gas separation. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC), an entirely new combustion principle avoids this difficulty by inherent CO2 capture, using metal oxides for oxygen transfer from air to fuel. The process has been demonstrated in small scale with gaseous fuels. However, with solid fuels it would be difficult to reach high fuel conversion, with the oxygen-carrier materials used so far. But a new type of combined oxides based on manganese has the ability not only to react with gaseous fuel, but also to release gaseous oxygen, which would fundamentally change the concept.

The programme would provide 1) new oxygen-carrier materials with unique properties that would make this low-cost/high-efficiency option of CO2 capture possible, 2) cold-flow model investigation of suitable reactor system configurations and components, 3) a demonstration of this new combustion technology at the pilot plant level, 4) a model of the process comprising a full understanding, including kinetics, equilibria, hydrodynamics of fluidized reactors, mass and heat balances.

The basis of this programme is the discovery of a number of oxygen-releasing combined manganese oxides, having properties that can make a CLC with solid fuels a break-through process for CO2 capture. The purpose of the programme is to perform a comprehensive study of these materials, to demonstrate that they work in real systems, to achieve a full understanding of how they work in interaction with solid fuels in fluidized beds and to assess how this process would work in the full scale.

Climate negotiations and agreements could be significantly facilitated by this low cost option for CO2 capture which, in principle, should be applicable to 25% of the global CO2 emissions, i.e. coal fired power plants. It would also provide a future means of removing CO2 from the atmosphere at low cost by burning biofuel and capture CO2.

The ACARE Vision 2020 document set the ambitious goal of a 50% reduction in aircraft emissions that can only be achieved through a step change in aircraft technology. Adaptive structures and morphing aircraft are novel technologies that can provide this step change, and this proposal provides an efficient method to model, optimize and realize these structures. Morphing aircraft have the ability to alter the shape of their wings to improve fuel efficiency or to increase control effectiveness. The Wright brothers employed wing warping for roll control, but as aircraft speeds increased compliant structures were replaced with small, rigid control surfaces. Bird flight motivates the search for more efficient solutions, where a compliant structure is continuously optimized in flight using distributed sensors and actuators. From the structural perspective the objective is to produce fully integrated, hierarchical structures with compliance control. However the requirements are conflicting: the structure must be stiff to withstand the external loads, but must be flexible to enable shape changes. The solution to this conflict is to design the structure to decouple the two actions, through components with significant anisotropy and integrated actuation. The components may be modelled at the micro scale, but these models are too large for system optimization studies. This proposal provides a step change to existing methods by developing a framework where multi-scale and multi-physics modelling may be achieved efficiently, though significant improvements in the way in which the different models of varying fidelity communicate.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,481,462</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OMSQC"><Rcn>110392</Rcn><Nid>12685</Nid><HI>Max Planck Institut Fur Kohlenforschung, Germany</HI><Name>Orthogonalization Models in Semiempirical Quantum Chemistry</Name><PI>Walter Thiel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The proposal aims at the development of a generally applicable semiempirical approach that goes beyond the current standard model by including explicit orthogonalization and dispersion terms into the semiempirical Hamiltonian. We have recently shown in preliminary work on organic molecules that such orthogonalization models (OMx = OM1, OM2, OM3) are significantly more accurate than standard semiempirical methods (AM1, PM3, PM6) both for ground-state and excited-state properties, at comparable computational costs. We plan to improve the OMx models by incorporating dispersion corrections (OMx-D) and by extending the formalism from an sp to an spd basis (OMx-DE). The resulting approaches will be parameterized for all chemically important main-group elements and transition metals to generate the next generation of generally applicable semiempirical methods. These methods are designed to fill the currently existing gap between density functional theory (DFT) and classical force field approaches. Being about 1,000 times faster than DFT, and being capable of treating electronic events (unlike classical force fields), OMx-based methods are expected to enable realistic electronic structure calculations, with useful accuracy, on large complex systems in all branches of chemistry. Especially when applied in a multi-method strategy, with synergistic use of different computational tools, this will allow the modelling of many chemically relevant systems that are currently beyond reach for computational chemistry. Proof-of-concept applications will address the reaction mechanisms of enzymatic reactions (biocatalysis) and electronically excited states (organic solar cells, photoactive proteins, excited-state dynamics in complex systems). The successful development of generally applicable OMx-based methods will provide a breakthrough in computational chemistry by opening up new areas of application."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,996,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OPTELOMAC"><Rcn>93585</Rcn><Nid>12617</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Opto-Electronic Organic Materials by New Acetylene Chemistry</Name><PI>Fran&#195;&#167;ois Nico Diederich</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Atom-economic, atom-economic (""click""-type)transformations of donor (N,N-dialkylaniline, TTF, ferrocene)-activated acetylenes with strong electron-accepting olefins (TCNE, TCNQ, tricyanovinyl derivatives) are applied to the construction of stable molecular and supramolecular chromophores with unusual electronic and optical properties.

My idea is based upon our distributed-feedback lasers in rare-earth-ion-doped aluminum oxide waveguides on a silicon chip with ultra-narrow linewidths of 1 kHz, corresponding to Q-factors exceeding 10^11, intra-cavity laser intensities of several watts over a waveguide cross-section of 2 micrometer, and light interaction lengths reaching 20 km. Optical read-out of the laser frequency and linewidth is achieved by frequency down-conversion via detection of the GHz beat signal of two such lasers positioned in the same waveguide or in parallel waveguides on the same microchip.
The sensitivity of optical detection is related to the laser linewidth, interaction length, and transverse mode overlap with the measurand; its potential of optically exciting ions or molecules and its optical trapping force are related to the laser intensity. By applying novel concepts, we will decrease the laser linewidth to 1 Hz (Q-factor &gt; 10^14), thereby also significantly increasing the intra-cavity intensity and light interaction length, simplify the read-out by reducing the line-width separation between two lasers to the MHz regime, and increase the mode interaction with the environment by either increasing its evanescent field or perpendicularly intersecting a nanofluidic channel with the optical waveguide, thereby allowing for unprecedented sensitivity of optical detection on a microchip. We will exploit this dual-wavelength distributed-feedback laser sensor for the first-ever demonstrations of intra-laser-cavity (ILC) optical trapping and detection of nano-sized biological objects in an optofluidic chip, ILC trace-gas detection on a microchip, ILC Raman spectrometry on a microchip, and ILC spectroscopy of single rare-earth ions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,958</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ORISTARS"><Rcn>103194</Rcn><Nid>10629</Nid><HI>Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, France</HI><Name>"Toward a Complete View of Star Formation: The Origin of Molecular Clouds, Prestellar Cores, and Star Clusters"</Name><PI>Philippe Jacques Antoine Andr&#195;&#169;</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding star formation from large to small scales is a major unsolved problem of modern astrophysics, fundamental in its own right and having a profound bearing on both galaxies and planet formation.To achieve a breakthrough in our observational and theoretical knowledge of star formation, we propose to confront numerical simulations with observations obtained with state-of-the-art instrumentation, including instruments developed by our group.

The project title is  Open silicon based research platform for emerging devices  and indicates that many of the future emerging devices will be based on a silicon fabrication base platform but may not be fully based on silicon as the active semiconductor material. Over the past 10 years this research team has established a versatile fabrication technology platform in excellent condition to open up a variety of new technologies to explore nanometer minimum feature size in realizable electrical repeatable devices structures.

The proposed project has five different focus areas outlined. It covers a broad range of critical research issues that can be foreseen as groundbreaking topics for the period beyond 2015. the different topics addressed are;

1) Three dimensional FET nanostructures based on SiNW and GeNW with advanced configuration.
2) New applications of SiNW with build-in strain for fast silicon-base optoelectronic devices.
3) Low frequency noise in advanced nanoelectronic structures
4) THz devices for IR-detection
5) Bio-sensor nanoelectronics for extreme bio-molecule sensitivity and real time detection of DNA.

These areas are carefully chosen to assemble the right mix with predictable research success and with a few areas that can be called high gain/high risk. In particular we want to mention that focus area 2 and 4 have a great potential impact when successful but also at a certain higher risk for a more difficult implementation in future devices. There is in no cases any risk that the research will not generate high quality scientific results.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OSYRIS"><Rcn>111149</Rcn><Nid>10128</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut De Ciencies Fotoniques, Spain</HI><Name>Open SYstems RevISited: From Brownian motion to quantum simulators</Name><PI>Maciej Lewenstein</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal concerns open systems, i.e. systems interacting with the environment, and their fundamental role in natural sciences.

Toxic, persistent, unresolved and unidentified, complex mixtures (UCMs) of organic chemicals are abundant all over the globe. These UCMs, which encompass a number of chemical classes, are outside present EU and world pollutant regulations. It is very important that these toxicants are identified, measured and their effects studied. Until recent work in my lab, few methods allowed such UCMs to be identified. Even now, we have only made studies of unresolved alkylated derivatives of benzene; there are numerous other unstudied classes of UCM chemicals widespread in the environment. These will be amenable to study by the new methods once optimised and new high throughput screening methods will then allow 10,000 chemicals per day to be tested for toxicity. In the present project, firstly, novel gas chromatography x gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-ToF-MS) methods will be used to separate, identify and measure, novel UCM compounds isolated from water  soluble  fractions of a range of crude oils; secondly, the same methods will be used to identify previously UCM toxicants in polluted mussels collected from a range of global locations. Thirdly, representatives of each compound class will be synthesised and toxicities assayed using mussel feeding rates, amphipod reproduction and growth rates and fish hepatocyte assays. Finally, the UCMs, newly resolved and identified in polluted mussels will be isolated and fractionated by preparative high performance liquid chromatography and their toxicities assayed, in an effects-directed approach. This will establish definitively the range of compounds in the UCMs that are toxic, and will deliver new methods by which UCMs may be routinely assayed and no longer overlooked. The major outcome of this investigation will be much improved assessment of the effects of organic chemical pollutants on the health of the global coastal marine environment</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OXLEET"><Rcn>93235</Rcn><Nid>11181</Nid><HI>Stockholms Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Oxidation via low-energy electron transfer.

There is currently a need from society to replace waste-producing expensive oxidants by environmentally benign oxidants in industrial oxidation reactions. The aim with the proposed research is to develop novel green oxidation methodology that also involves hydrogen transfer reactions. In the oxidation reactions the goal is to use molecular oxygen (air) or hydrogen peroxide as the oxidants. In the present project new catalytic oxidations via low-energy electron transfer will be developed. The catalytic reactions obtained can be used for racemization of alcohols and amines and for oxygen- and hydrogen peroxide-driven oxidations of various substrates. Examples of some reactions that will be studied are oxidative palladium-catalyzed C-C bond formation and metal-catalyzed C-H oxidation including dehydrogenation reactions with iron and ruthenium. Coupled catalytic systems where electron transfer mediators (ETMs) facilitate electron transfer from the reduced catalyst to molecular oxygen (hydrogen peroxide) will be studied. Highly efficient reoxidation systems will be designed by covalently linking two electron transfer mediators (ETMs). The intramolecular electron transfer in these hybrid ETM catalysts will significantly increase the rate of oxidation reactions. The research will lead to development of more efficient reoxidation systems based on molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, as well as more versatile racemization catalysts for alcohols and amines.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,722,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OXYGEN"><Rcn>98256</Rcn><Nid>8811</Nid><HI>Syddansk Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>How oxygen regulates the structure and function of microbial ecosystems</Name><PI>Donald Eugene Canfield</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our project is called OXYGEN.

Spin-singlet dimers (a weak metal-metal bond) are known in several materials, but recent discoveries of more exotic species such as 18-electron heptamers in AlV2O4 and 3-atom trimerons in magnetite (Fe3O4) have shown that a general new class of quantum electronic states that we call &#226;&#128;&#152;orbital molecules&#226;&#128;&#153; awaits exploration.

The discovery of trimerons is particularly important as it provides the solution to the important and long-running problem of the low temperature Verwey phase of magnetite. This was discovered in 1939 but remained contentious as the complex superstructure was unknown. The applicant and co-workers recently used a synchrotron microcrystal technique to solve the structure. This showed that the Verwey transition is driven by Fe2+/3+ charge ordering in a first approximation, but with the formation of a self-organised network of trimeron orbital molecules that had not been predicted in over 70 years of previous study.

To expand the magnetite discovery into a general breakthrough in understanding quantum matter, this project will explore chemical tuning of orbital molecule self-organisation, discovery of novel orbital molecule orders in frustrated networks, and investigations of trimeron glass and liquid phases in magnetite. Evidence for liquid phases is key to possible applications. The project will develop high resolution diffraction and total scattering methods to determine long range and local orbital molecule orders, with further characterisation from magnetisation and conductivity measurements.  Samples will be synthesised at ambient and high pressures.

This study will pioneer a new area of research in the electronic properties of solids, and may help to underpin future post-silicon orbitronic technologies based on the creation and manipulation of orbital states.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,315,142</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OutEFLUCOP"><Rcn>98073</Rcn><Nid>10026</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Out of Equilibrium Fluctuations in Confined Phase Transitions</Name><PI>Sergio Ciliberto</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims at studying experimentally the out of equilibrium fluctuations
in strongly confined fluids. Three main problems will be analyzed :
a) The effects on the dynamics when the fluctuations are confined in a volume smaller than the spatial correlation length; b) The fluctuations of the injected and dissipated power in out of equilibrium in highly confined systems, where extreme events may produce
an instantaneous ''negative entropy production rate''. c) Are fluctuations a limiting factor for application ? Might they be useful ?
Our strategy is to enhance the role of fluctuations and correlations working close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. We will work  at the critical point
of mixing  of either  a binary mixture of fluids or of   polymer blends, whose microscopic time scales and correlation lengths are  much longer than those of binary mixtures of simple fluids. The local   measurements and the confinement will be realized using an original ultra low noise Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)  developed  in our laboratory. This AFM will be used in association with a near field aperture   free light scattering technique, local and global dielectric   techniques and evanescent waves imaging. This experimental set up, measuring local and global variables, will give new insight to two other interesting phenomena that are present in the critical regions : the finite size effects (such as dimensional crossover and time dependent critical Casimir effect) and the relaxation towards equilibrium after a quench at the critical point. These two phenomena have been widely investigated both theoretically and numerically butonly a few experiments have tried to measure directly the local fluctuations of confined fluids. Due to the universal nature   of phase transitions the results can be applied to many other systems in   which measurements are more complicated.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,376,117</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OxideSurfaces"><Rcn>102225</Rcn><Nid>10397</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Microscopic Processes and Phenomena at Oxide Surfaces and Interfaces</Name><PI>Ulrike Diebold</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Metal oxide surfaces and interfaces play a key role in energy-related applications and in novel schemes for electronic devices that exploit the special physical and chemical properties of these promising materials.

For progress in both areas, a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the atomic and molecular processes that occur at oxide surfaces and interfaces is critical.  Experiments on well-characterized model systems in conjunction with computational modelling can provide such insights, but current investigations are limited in the range of materials and scope of phenomena that can be studied, and to experiments in a low-pressure environment.

Research conducted in this project will push these limits by:

No experiment has yet come close to the highest possible coupling efficiency attainable in such a fundamental system. The usual way of enhancing light-matter coupling is to place an atom inside a cavity. Another approach involves setting the atom in the near field of a plasmonic antenna. The free space approach, however, is special: a light field matched to the atomic dipole provides many desired aspects of fully efficient coupling. The birth of this new research area was marked by the PI's pioneering publication in 2000 arguing that efficient coupling of an atom to a light field is possible in free space without modifying the density of modes of the light field such as in a cavity or having competing radiative or non-radiative decay channels such as in plasmonic enhancement. At the time of writing, the highest probability achieved for exciting a single atom with a single photon in free space is less than 1%. At the heart of the project proposed here is a deep diffraction-limited parabolic mirror, which can provide the required aberration-free focusing of a vectorial dipole wave over the full 4&#207;&#128; solid angle &#226;&#128;&#147; a true challenge to optics. Perfectly efficient free space coupling to a single quantum system will be a novel building block for numerous applications.

Building on the promise of unlimited processing/storage power, applications today process big amounts of data scattered over the cloud and react to events happening across the cloud. Software services must be both standard components to pay off for their provider and highly configurable and customizable to serve competitive needs of multiple tenants.
Developing such applications is challenging, given the predominant programming technology, whose fundamental abstractions were conceived for the traditional computing model.
Existing abstractions are laid out to process individual data/events. Making the complexity of applications processing big data/events manageable requires abstractions to intentionally express high-level correlations between data/events, freeing the programmer from the job of tracking the data and keeping tabs on relevant events across a cloud. Existing abstractions also fail to reconcile software reuse and extensibility at the level of large-scale software services.

PACE will deliver first-class linguistic abstractions for expressing sophisticated correlations between data/events to be used as primitives to express high-level functionality. Armed with them, programmers will be relieved from micromanaging data/events and can turn their attention to what the cloud has to offer. Applications become easier to understand, maintain, evolve and more amenable to automated reasoning and sophisticated optimizations.

Computer models used to predict directions of future climate change are validated by means of retrospective analysis of past climate changes. Detailed reconstruction of past climates, especially temperature, is, therefore, of considerable importance. Several tools (proxies) are available to reconstruct absolute sea surface temperatures. Continental temperature reconstructions, however, are hampered by a lack of quantitative temperature proxies and, consequently, are often qualitative rather than quantitative. Recently, my group discovered a new quantitative continental temperature proxy, the MBT index, which is based on the distribution of membrane lipids of soil bacteria. Their composition is a function of annual mean air temperature (MAT). These lipids are transported by rivers to the ocean and deposited in marine sediments. Determination of the MBT index in cores from river fans can, thus, potentially be used to reconstruct continental, river basin-integrated, temperatures from a marine record in front of large river outflows. We will study the mechanisms of transport of the soil bacterial membrane lipids to the ocean in many river systems and compare the down-core changes in their composition with conventional MAT proxies. We will also investigate the potential of lake sediments as archives of continental climate change using our new MBT palaeothermometer and apply this thermometer in the assessment of continental climate change during the transition from a hothouse to an icehouse Earth in the last 100 million years. This project that combines aspects of microbiology, molecular ecology, lipid biogeochemistry and paleoclimatology will bring this novel continental palaeothermometer to maturity.  If we can ground-truth the use of the MBT-proxy, it will open up new windows in palaeoclimatological research and thus contribute to improvement of current climate models.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PAHS"><Rcn>93908</Rcn><Nid>12293</Nid><HI>Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>The Role of Large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules in the Universe</Name><PI>Alexander Godfried Gerardus Maria Tielens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Strong emission features dominate the IR spectra of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way, galaxies in the local Universe and out to redshifts of ~3. These features are generally attributed to IR fluorescence of large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules pumped by UV photons. These species must be abundant, ubiquitous, and an important component of the ISM. However, despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, no specific PAH or even classes of PAHs have been unambiguously identified. Hence, we do not really know the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of these species and therefore cannot quantify their role in the Universe. I propose a highly interdisciplinary program combining observational, theoretical, and experimental studies to determine the IR emission characteristics of large PAH molecules, their origin and evolution, and their influence on the Universe around us. The proposed program will analyze interstellar PAH spectral maps obtained with Spitzer and ISO and relate the spatial variations in the spectral diversity to variations in the characteristics of the radiation field and the physical conditions of these regions that will be obtained with Herschel. This observational program will be aided by an innovative laboratory program that will measure the IR characteristics of large, astrophysically relevant PAH molecules in the gas phase and by a modelling program of the emission characteristics of these PAHs in space. In addition, the photochemistry of gaseous PAHs will be studied in the laboratory using novel techniques, allowing us to model the chemical evolution of PAHs and their reaction products in the interstellar medium.

Based on the multiscale and multitechnique study of morphologically preserved microorganisms fossilized within ancient siliceous nodules, I propose to chronologically reconcile the evolution of metabolisms of life forms during the Precambrian with the variation of (sea)water paleo-temperatures registered by the silica matrix in which the investigated organic microfossils are embedded.
Spatially-resolved information on fossil organic constituent speciation and their structural relationships with the silica matrix will be obtained at the nanometer scale using a unique combination of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, notably including STXM and TEM. Crucial information on paleo-metabolisms will be obtained from NanoSIMS experiments by measuring the stable H-C-N-S isotope composition of the investigated fossilized objects at the scale of individual cells. In parallel, laboratory experiments will be conducted to better assess the potential isotopic and molecular evolution of organic molecules during the fossilization process. Estimations of water paleo-temperatures &#226;&#128;&#147; likely corresponding to oceanic paleo-temperatures &#226;&#128;&#147; will be achieved based on the distribution of the silicon and oxygen isotopic composition of silica closely associated to the fossil cells, measured at the very high spatial resolution of the NanoSIMS. Furthermore, the study of natural proxies will provide a more profound understanding of the significance of the temperature registered by the isotopic compositions of Precambrian cherts. In addition to radically change scientific ideas about Precambrian Paleontology, the technical and scientific developments resulting from this work will be broadly applicable and serve numerous communities.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,468,852</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PALP"><Rcn>111016</Rcn><Nid>10149</Nid><HI>Lunds Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Physics of Atoms with Attosecond Light Pulses</Name><PI>Anne L'huillier Wahlstr&#195;&#182;m</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The field of attosecond science is now entering the second decade of its existence, with good prospects for breakthroughs in a number of areas.

Our project can be divided into three parts:

1. Interferometric measurements using tunable attosecond pulses
How long time does it take for an electron to escape its potential?
We will measure photoemission time delays for several atomic systems, using a tunable attosecond pulse source. This type of measurements will be extended to multiple ionization and excitation processes, using coincidence measurements to disentangle the different channels and infrared ionization for analysis.

2. XUV pump/XUV probe experiments using intense attosecond pulses
How long does it take for an atom to become an ion once a hole has been created?
Using intense attosecond pulses and the possibility to do XUV pump/ XUV probe experiments, we will study the transition between nonsequential double ionization, where the photons are absorbed simultaneously and all electrons emitted at the same time and sequential ionization where electrons are emitted one at a time.

3. ""Complete"" attosecond experiments using high-repetition rate attosecond pulses
We foresee a paradigm shift in attosecond science with the new high repetition rate systems based on optical parametric chirped pulse amplification which are coming to age. We want to combine coincidence measurement with angular detection, allowing us to characterize (two-particle) electronic wave packets both in time and in momentum and to study their quantum-mechanical properties."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,047,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PALs"><Rcn>108477</Rcn><Nid>9919</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>The calm before the storm: Pre-stellar cores as Astrophysical Laboratories</Name><PI>Paola Caselli</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Stars like our Sun and planets like our Earth form in dense regions within interstellar molecular clouds, called pre-stellar cores (PSCs).  PSCs provide the initial conditions in the process of star and planet formation, but large uncertainties exist concerning basic astrophysical processes and parameters, such as surface chemistry, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, the H2 ortho-to-para ratio, the abundance of atomic Oxygen and ""metals"". In current models, these parameters/processes are typically fixed to some ""canonical"" values and variations across PSCs are neglected. With the new generation of telescopes and the advances in radiative transfer and dynamical/chemical modelling, the time has now come to develop theoretical models without highly uncertain parameters.

PCSs are dark, cold and quiescent. They are the simplest units in the process of star formation. Thus, they provide a unique opportunity for the study of fundamental astrophysical processes in a ""calm"" environment, just before the battering of the protostellar ""storm"".  For this reason, PSCs can be used as ideal laboratories to refine our understanding of how stars and planets form. With this advanced grant fellowship, I plan to connect state of the art dynamical and chemical models and test them against detailed observations of prototypical PCSs to first deliver parameters and processes that are needed to understand basic physical mechanisms.  I will then explore in detail the formation, evolution and physical/chemical structure of PSCs in different environments. Finally, with the help of ALMA data, I will focus on the central few thousands AU and study the first steps toward the formation and early evolution of proto-planetary disks (PPDs).

This is sorely needed to enable us to understand the initial conditions in the process of star and planet formation and to link PSCs with PPDs, currently studied by different communities, with the ultimate aim of understanding our chemical/physical heritage."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,291</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PANDORA"><Rcn>108269</Rcn><Nid>9433</Nid><HI>The University Of Liverpool, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Performance Active Nanoscale Devices Obtained by Rational Assembly</Name><PI>Mathias Brust</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The key challenge of this proposal is to create artificial nanostructures that perform active tasks inspired by biology such as transport, chemical synthesis and molecular motion.

Inspiration on how to design such materials is best drawn from Nature which is unsurpassed in its ability to combine molecular building blocks into perfectly designed versatile super- and supramolecular structures with well-defined properties, disassembly patterns, and biological functions. A closer look into the structural build-up of biological materials gives important clues on how to design synthetic functional materials with desirable environmental interaction. In addition to advanced synthesis, surface modification and processing, the materials and their degradation behavior will be thoroughly characterized by using traditional characterization techniques in combination with latest spectroscopic and imaging techniques.

For example, accelerated electrons are deflected in the cathode tube of televisions or computer screens. X rays are routinely used for non destructive material or body inspection, for example to check human bodies (to visualize tumour cells, dental caries and osseous fractures) or to increase the safety of travellers by inspecting their luggage. Ionizing radiations are efficiently used in radiotherapy to cure cancer by damaging irreversibly the DNA of cells. From the fundamental point of view, the development of ultra short bunches of energetic particles and X ray photons is of crucial importance in biology, chemistry, and solid state physics, where these beams could be used to diagnose the electronic, atomic or molecular dynamics with unprecedented, simultaneous time and space resolution. The interaction of laser beams with matter in the relativistic regime has permitted to demonstrate new approaches for producing energetic particle beams, thanks to the tremendous electric fields that plasmas can support. The incredible progress of laser plasma accelerators has allowed physicists to produce high quality beams of energetic radiation and particles. These beams could lend themselves to applications in many fields, including medicine (radiotherapy, and imaging), radiation biology, chemistry (radiolysis), physics and material science (radiography, electron and photon diffraction), security (material inspection), and of course accelerator science. Stimulated by the advent of compact and powerful lasers, with moderate costs and high repetition rate, this research field has witnessed considerably growth in the past few years, and the promises of laser plasma accelerators are in tremendous progress.

Progress has been made towards the discovery of mechanisms subserving the conscious experience of interacting with mechanical objects. This progress is due in part to the availability of new instruments that can tightly control mechanical stimulation of both the ascending, i.e. sensory, and descending, i.e. motor, pathways. The program describes the design of new mechanical stimulation delivery equipment capable of fine segregation of haptic cues at different length scales and different time scales so that controlled stimuli may be delivered with the ease and accuracy which is today possible when studying vision or audition. The purpose of this equipment is to disentangle and recombine the individual cues used by the brain to recover the attributes of an object, leading to the identification of the computations that must be performed to achieve a perceptual outcome. In vision and audition, much is known of the nature of the peripheral and central computations, but in touch, for lack of proper equipment, little is known. From this knowledge, I aim at developing a theory of haptic perception which rests on the observation that these computations are distributed in the physics of mechanical contact, in the biomechanics of the hand, including the skin, the musculoskeletal organization, innervation, and in central neural processes.

All aspects of our lives are concerned. Our data include family pictures, insurance documents, bills and receipts, health records, cryptographic keys, electronic identities, certificates, and passwords. We store and process them on several personal devices as well as in the cloud via services such as Flickr or Facebook. Managing these data is challenging: they have to be updated, backed up, synchronised across devices, and shared. In case of emergency, health records must be accessible to doctors or designated family members. Many of these data are sensitive, but adequately protecting them is virtually impossible for private users with current tools.
Encrypting data makes managing them only harder. It destroys much of the functionality that users have come to expect such as synchronising and sharing; mismanagement of encryption keys might even render data illegible to the owner himself.

Our goal is to develop fundamentally new cryptographic primitives, protocols, and policy languages that let human users deal with cryptographic keys and encrypted personal data. We will invent mechanisms that 1) enable humans to securely store and retrieve cryptographic keys based on a single human-memorisable password, on biometrics, on hardware tokens; 2) enable end users to manage their various cryptographic keys and encrypted data via these keys; and 3) enable users and cloud hosts to perform useful operations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt. Our mechanisms will run on resource-constrained devices, i.e., they will be efficient and yet secure in the sense that they provide security guarantees, especially in the presence of untrusted cloud hosts.

That is to create, study, and implement truly microscopic structures with nano scale accuracy that can perform robotic tasks and that are entirely powered and controlled by light. This idea brings immense challenges both from the point of view of the physics involved as well as the chemistry needed to create the appropriate materials, but if successful can also have a huge impact.
To achieve this, we will combine our expertise on complex photonic materials and direct laser writing, to create micro structured patterns in liquid crystal elastomers, which are rubber-like polymers with liquid crystalline properties that can be triggered with light. In our view, this opens up a new strategy to create robots of various kinds, on a truly micrometer length scale. That is, micro robots that can swim, walk, or crawl, and when at destination perform specific tasks, controlled and driven by light.
This proposal, in the first instance, deals with fundamental, curiosity-driven research and wishes to address the wealth of physics and chemistry that arises when combining nano photonics with micro robotics. Having said that, the range of potential applications is very broad. Our photonic micro robots would be able to penetrate otherwise difficult to access environments and perform tasks such as sensing or sampling. They could be made in large quantities which means they could also be put into action collectively in swarms (using mechanical and/or optical interaction between the individual robots).
The project is truly interdisciplinary, which makes it very challenging but also exciting. The photonic micro robotic structures will be created by bringing together concepts from physics and chemistry, while the inspiration for designs comes partly from biology and potential applications can be foreseen in medicine.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,200,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PHOTOMETA"><Rcn>107047</Rcn><Nid>12966</Nid><HI>Foundation For Research And Technology Hellas, Greece</HI><Name>Photonic Metamaterials: From Basic Research to Applications</Name><PI>Costas Soukoulis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Novel artificial materials (photonic crystals (PCs), negative index materials (NIMs), and plasmonics) enable the realization of innovative EM properties unattainable in naturally existing materials.

The present project combines NIMs, PCs, and aspects of plasmonics in a unified way in order to promote the development of functional MMs, and mainly functional optical MMs (OMMs). It identifies the main obstacles, proposes specific approaches to deal with them, and intends to study unexplored capabilities of OMMs. The project objectives are: (a) Design and realization of 3d OMMs, and achieve new metasurface designs applying Babinet&#226;&#128;&#153;s principle. (b) Understanding and reducing the losses in OMM by incorporating gain and EM induced transparency (EIT). (c) Achieving highly efficient PC nanolasers and surface plasmons (SPs) lasers.

Some of these objectives seem almost certainly realizable; others are more risky but with higher reward if accomplished; some are directed towards new specific applications, while others explore new physical reality.
The accomplishment of those objectives requires novel ideas, advanced computational techniques, nanofabrication approaches, and testing.

These processes occur on an ultrafast timescale and result in a stable product. The photosynthetic apparatus consists of a complex set of pigment-proteins that perform these delicate processes with a quantum efficiency close to 1. Proteins are intrinsically disordered and display dynamics over a fast range oof times, from femtoseconds to seconds. In this proposal I wish to explore how this dynamic protein matrix facilitates or maybe even drives the primary events of photosynthesis. Together with my co-investigator Bruno Robert I plan to investigate four aspects of how the protein matrix may affect this important biological process. In the first project we will study if the charge separation in Photosystem 2 occurs along multiple pathways, depending on the realization of the disorder. Project 2 concerns the possible role of quantum coherence in charge separation in Photosystem 2. In project 3 we will investigate how the dynamic protein matrix maybe even actively stabilizes the early charge separation. Project 4 aims to find out how functional transitions in photosynthetic proteins are coupled to conformational changes. The latter relates to the idea that the peripheral light-harvesting complex of plants, LHCII, plays a role in photoprotection by switching between a light-harvesting state and a quenching state. The project combines a number of state-of-the-art biophysical approaches and furthermore aims to develop new techniques: 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and plasmon wave resonance spectroscopy. The final result will deliver a unique view on how the physics of protein matter manifests itself in biology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,864,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PHYSAPS"><Rcn>192385</Rcn><Nid>13456</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Physics of Active Particle Suspensions</Name><PI>Wilson Che Kei Poon</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"&#226;&#128;&#152;Active matter&#226;&#128;&#153; is matter that is intrinsically out of equilibrium. In particular, an &#226;&#128;&#152;active suspension&#226;&#128;&#153; is made up of self-propelled particles or droplets dispersed in a liquid. Active matter is not in thermal equilibrium even in the absence of external driving, and display fascinating properties.

There is yet no gener- ally accepted statistical mechanics of active matter, where the absence of detailed balance means that small differences in microscopic dynamics can in principle lead to very different macroscopic behaviour. Moreover, there is no a priori reason to believe that a reduced description in terms of just a few macroscopic parameters (such as effective temperature and density) is possible. I propose a systematic pro- gramme of experiments to discover when and how microscopic dynamics affect the macroscopic behaviour of active suspensions, whether any of their behaviour has analogues in suspensions of passive particles and droplets, and how activity can be described using coarse-grained variables. To ensure that the experiments can be tightly coupled to theory and simulations, I will use well-characterised, model systems of active particles. Developing model systems is therefore a subsidiary, but crucial, goal of my programme. Some of these systems will be designed to be as similar as possible in their passive properties, but quite distinct in terms of their microscopic dynamics &#226;&#128;&#147; a &#226;&#128;&#152;luxury&#226;&#128;&#153; that is typically only available to theo- rists and simulators. Experimenting with such model systems should reveal what phenomena are generic to activity, and what phenomena are specific to particular kinds of microscopic dynamics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,601</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PISA"><Rcn>106926</Rcn><Nid>12993</Nid><HI>The University Of Sheffield, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Polymerisation-induced self-assembly</Name><PI>Steven Peter Armes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The efficient, reproducible synthesis of bespoke organic nanoparticles of controlled size, morphology and surface functionality in concentrated solution is widely regarded to be a formidable technical challenge. However, recent advances by the Principal Investigator (PI) suggest that this important problem can be addressed by polymerisation-induced self-assembly (PISA) directly in aqueous solution to form a range of diblock copolymer 'nano-objects'. The proposal combines three synergistic themes within the PI's group: (i) controlled-structure water-soluble polymers, (ii) living radical polymerisation and (iii) novel polymer colloids. More specifically, the PI will work closely with four post-doctoral scientists and a PhD student to design a series of diblock copolymer nanoparticles with either spherical, worm-like or vesicular morphologies under dispersion polymerisation conditions in either water, alcohol or n-alkanes. This exciting and timely fundamental research programme will produce world-leading scientific innovation. Moreover, the targeted nanoparticles will be evaluated for various potential applications, such as (i) intracellular delivery of various biomolecules (e.g. DNA, proteins, antibodies), (ii) readily sterilisable biocompatible hydrogels, (iii) bespoke Pickering emulsiifiers and foam stabilisers, (iv) tough nanocomposite monoliths, (v) new components for next-generation paints, (vi) novel boundary lubricants for high performance engine oils. Informal collaborations with four academic partners and four industrial companies will ensure that maximum scientific value and economic impact is extracted from this ambitious work programme. All research findings will be published in top-quality scientific journals and the PI will provide appropriate mentoring to inspire his research team to become the next generation of creative, productive scientists for the EC.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,480,300</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PLAQNAP"><Rcn>110316</Rcn><Nid>10229</Nid><HI>Syddansk Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Plasmon-based Functional and Quantum Nanophotonics</Name><PI>Sergey Bozhevolnyi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Plasmon-based nanophotnics, an explosively growing research field concerned with surface-plasmon waveguides and circuitry, is oriented towards exploiting unique perspectives opened for radiation guiding along metal surfaces: extreme mode confinement (i.e., far beyond the diffraction limit) and seamless interfacing of electronic and photonic circuits (that both utilize the same metal circuitry). At the same time, unavoidable radiation absorption by metals results in the fundamental trade-off between the mode confinement and propagation loss, so that the problem of making the most of the above unique features becomes of paramount importance. The proposal encompasses two ground-breaking research directions in plasmonics that explore and utilize extremely confined plasmon-waveguide modes for functional and quantum nanophotonics. These directions of in-depth investigations concentrate within two interrelated and largely unexplored research areas within plasmonics: development of ultra-compact plasmonic configurations exhibiting unique functionalities and realization of strong coupling between extremely confined plasmonic modes and individual quantum emitters. Fundamental studies of ultimate mode confinement and coupling to quantum emitters would evolve into investigations carried out within forefront topics including (i) dynamic control of plasmon-waveguide modes using the same metal circuitry for both radiation guiding and its control with electrical signals; (ii) moulding the radiation flow by gradually varying waveguide cross sections in order to realize efficient nanofocusing of radiation, miniature ultra-dispersive wavelength-selective components and table-top models of plasmonic black holes, and (iii) quantum plasmonics with individual quantum emitters being strongly coupled to deep subwavelength surface plasmon modes, targeting the realization of a saturable waveguide mirror, single-photon transistor and long-distance entanglement of two remote quantum emitters."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,278,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PLASMAQUO"><Rcn>98099</Rcn><Nid>12843</Nid><HI>Asociacion Centro De Investigacion Cooperativa En Biomateriales, Spain</HI><Name>Development of plasmonic quorum sensors for understanding bacterial-eukaryotic cell relations</Name><PI>Luis Manuel Liz Marz&#195;&#161;n</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal aims at the development of novel nanostructured materials based on crystalline assemblies of anisotropic plasmonic (gold/silver) nanoparticles, to be used for the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules, and to the demonstration of applications of such materials to monitor population kinetics in bacterial colonies and the determination of the interaction mechanisms between mixed colonies and their manipulation through external parameters. This will involve a first stage related to the careful design of the most appropriate nanoparticle morphology and composition, as well as an understanding of their specific assembly processes (both on substrates and in solution), so that the collective plasmonic response will be optimized towards the enhancement of the Raman signal of the probe molecular codes. Coating of the nanoparticle supercrystals with a mesoporous layer will be required to protect them against contact with bacteria and cells, while permitting contact with the QS signaling molecules. Ultimately, when the sensing system has been optimized and its performance demonstrated for monitoring of QS signals and colony growth, two final and important goals will be pursued. First, the interaction between mixed colonies (bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-eukaryotic cell) will be monitored in order to get information about synergic or antagonist (toxicity) QS mechanisms during the growth and proliferation of different bacteria and interspecies. This goal will permit the design of in vitro experiments where a bacterial strain may be manipulated by means of external introduction of the appropriate QS signaling molecules.

These three subjects have strong overlap and are:

1) Non-linear phenomena and Plasmonic lasing: the introduction of optical-gain media into plasmonic waveguides has proven to be a feasible way to overcome the inherent losses within the metal. In order to reveal the physics behind this phenomenon, we intend to develop a new ab-initio theoretical framework that should combine the resolution of classical Maxwell&#226;&#128;&#153;s equations with a quantum-mechanical treatment of the molecules forming the optical-gain medium. Within this formalism we also aim to analyze in depth very recent proposals of plasmon-based nano-lasers, the design of active devices based on surface plasmons and the use of optical-gain media in metallic metamaterials.

2) Transformation Optics for Plasmonics:  we plan to apply the idea of Transformation Optics in connection with the concept of Metamaterials to devise new strategies for molding the propagation of surface plasmons in nanostructured metal surfaces. Additionally, we will use the Transformation Optics formalism to treat quasi-analytically non-local effects in plasmonic structures.

3) Quantum Plasmonics: several aspects of this new line of research will be tackled. Among others, fundamental studies of the coherence of surface plasmons that propagate along different metal waveguides after being generated by quantum emitters. A very promising line of research to explore will be plasmon-mediated interaction between qubits, taking advantage of the quasi-one-dimensional character of plasmonic waveguides. Strong-coupling phenomena between molecules and surface plasmons and the design of practical scenarios in which entanglement of surface plasmons could take place will be also addressed.

In particular with the progress nanofabrication techniques, the properties of surface plasmons (SP) can now be controlled by structuring metals at the nanometer scale. The overall objective of this proposal is to manipulate and control the properties of the SPs to analyze fundamental phenomena through which new capacities can emerge. The project is divided in four parts with strong overlap:   1) SP enhanced devices: We plan to use the benefits provided by SPs to enhance devices or create new device architectures. Textured metal surfaces, and the associated SP modes, can be used as antennas to extract, capture and control light in a variety of applications that include imaging and polarization sensing, nano-optical elements and detectors.   2) SP circuitry:  To achieve complete miniature SP photonic circuits, a number of components to launch SP, control their propagation and finally decouple SP back to light are necessary.  Much progress has been made in this direction but many challenges remain at the level of individual components and complete circuits that will be explored. 3) Molecule   SP interactions: Molecule - SP strongly coupled interactions are expected to modify extensively photophysical and photochemical processes that will be studied by time resolved techniques. This issue also has implications for generating all optical control needed in SP circuitry.  4) Casimir effect and SPs: The tailoring of  the Casimir force by enhancing the contribution of SP modes has been proposed by theoretical studies. Experiments will be undertaken to test the relationship between Casimir physics and plasmonics using nanostructured metal surfaces which could have significant consequences for nano-electro-mechanical systems.

This project aims at introducing a new paradigm in solid-state physics trough the manipulation of polaritons quantum fluids and condensates in properly designed traps : such fluids will bring a wide variety of novel properties. With my team, I have recently made major advances towards this by preparing high quality polariton traps and evidencing some of the aspects of the rich physics of polaritons fluids in traps.
The whole field of polariton fluids is still in its infancy and I am convinced that major discoveries will be made during the coming years both for propagating polariton fluids and for confined geometries. I intend to stay at the forefront the field of confined polaritons and to provide high quality structures to other labs. My studies will be oriented along three major lines, each requesting a significant effort.
- The study of polariton BECs and quantum fluids in planar microcavities, both in II-VIs and III-Vs,
- The manipulation of coherent polariton fluids in geometry controlled environments,
- The realization of BEC and quantum fluid based polaritronic devices.
Each of these three parts represents a major challenge with great potentialities. First, these topics are a really novel contribution in solid-state physics. Second, the possible manipulation of polariton condensates opens up a vast domain, which covers both fundamental and applied physics and which limits we are absolutely unable to assess yet. I feel that the transition from atom condensates to polariton condensates may bring similar improvements for possible devices than it has been the case for the transition between the electronic tube and the transistor.

Up to now we do not know HOW NATURE MAKES HADRONS one of the most important questions of contemporary structure-of-matter physics. Major breakthroughs are to be expected with new experimental facilities such as FAIR. Most studies in hadron physics at HESR/FAIR will employ beams of unpolarized antiprotons, but the most spectacular opportunities will arise for polarized antiprotons the physics case is exceptional. The flag-ship experiment, Drell-Yan production in double polarized proton-antiproton scattering, gives direct access to transversity , the terra incognita of nucleon spin structure. The provision of such beams presents enormous scientific / technological challenges and has never been achieved with intensities sufficient for the crucial experiments. State-of-the-art techniques are capable of producing intensities less than ~10^5 s-1, which cannot be efficiently accumulated. It is the aim of this project to develop an efficient method for POLARIZING ANTIPROTON BEAMS by in-situ build-up in a storage ring. The only viable method to do this effectively is through "spin-filtering" by the repeated interaction of an antiproton beam with a polarized hydrogen gas target in a cooler storage ring. This technique works with protons, but it is not clear how the polarization build-up happens in detail. Spin-filtering needs to be optimized and, in particular, it must be extended to antiprotons. Within the framework of this project, the aim is to provide polarized antiproton beams in a storage ring with at least WITH 10 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE higher intensity than previously possible. A very experienced team of scientists and engineers is needed, and this is available within my group. We will also strongly benefit from our collaboration partners. Thus, it is a "now or never" opportunity.

While fossil feedstocks are non-polar and processed at high temperatures in the gas phase, most biomass derived feedstocks are polar molecules, which are present in aqueous solution and are typically processed at relatively low temperatures in defunctionalization reactions. Yet, most approaches rely on the conventional wisdom of using catalysts developed for fossil feed processing where the conditions almost always exclude the use of polymeric catalysts. However, for the conditions of biomass processing, adapted polymeric catalysts could be ideally suited. This defines the goals of the proposed research program: known and newly designed polymeric catalysts will be explored with respect to their potential in biomass conversion reactions, which could lead to a new paradigm in catalytic biofeedstock processing. In order to achieve this objective, it will be attempted to produce four selected, exemplary classes of polymers in porous form with adjustable porosity. The porous polymer types will then be post-treated with different methods to introduce catalytic functionality (acid/base and redox functionality). The target processes in biomass conversion are prototypical examples which are representative for whole classes of reactions. These include the depolymerisation of the major components of lignocellulose (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) and the targeted synthesis of selected platform molecules starting from glucose as the depolymerisation product of cellulose. Successful completion would provide more efficient access to many novel value chains and establish a novel class of catalytic materials.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,764,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PREAS"><Rcn>111528</Rcn><Nid>9026</Nid><HI>Geological Survey Of Denmark And Greenland, Denmark</HI><Name>Predicting the arsenic content in groundwater of the floodplains in SE Asia</Name><PI>Diederik Jan Postma</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"More than 100 million people living on the floodplains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong and Red River, all draining the Himalayas, are consuming arsenic contaminated water. Providing safe drinking water for these people requires a quantitative understanding of the processes regulating the groundwater arsenic content and this knowledge is presently not available. In PREDIAS we propose a revolutionary new approach to study these arsenic contaminated aquifers where sediments and groundwaters are considered as one reacting unit that is changing over time. The key hypothesis is that it is the aquifer sediment burial age that is the overall controlling parameter for the arsenic content. This new approach is explored by studying the groundwater chemistry as a function of sediment burial age, which is equivalent to the geological evolution over time, in part of the Red River floodplain in Vietnam. The investigations comprise delineating the sedimentological development over the last 9000 yrs as well as reconstructing hydrogeological conditions over that period. Process studies will reveal the effect of burial age on the chemical properties of the sediments and the arsenic release mechanisms. They comprise the binding and release mechanisms of arsenic to the aquifer sediment, and the reactivity of sedimentary organic carbon and iron oxides which drive the redox reactions controlling the water chemistry and arsenic mobilization. Information on the sedimentological and hydrogeological development over time as well as a quantification of the geochemical processes will be incorporated in a  3-D reactive transport model which over the last 9000 years, in steps of about 1000 years, can predict the evolution of the arsenic content over space and time in the groundwater of the studied area.

De Polignac (1849) conjectured that for every even value of h, n and n+h are infinitely often primes simultaneously. These are the most basic problems on gaps and patterns in primes. Another one is the  conjecture of Waring (1770), stating that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions (AP) of primes. For the newest developments we cite Granville (Bull. AMS 43 (2006), p.93): ): Despite much research of excellent quality, there have been few breakthroughs on the most natural questions about the distribution of prime numbers in the last few decades. That situation has recently changed dramatically with two extraordinary breakthroughs, each on questions that the experts had held out little hope for in the foreseeable future. Green and Tao proved that there are infinitely many k-term arithmetic progressions of primes using methods that are mostly far removed from mainstream analytic number theory. Indeed, their work centers around a brilliant development of recent results in ergodic theory and harmonic analysis. Their proof is finished, in a natural way, by an adaptation of the proof of the other fantastic new result in this area, Goldston, Pintz and Yildirim s proof that there are  small  gaps between primes.  The proposal's aim is to study these types of patterns in primes with possible combination of the two theories. We quote 3 of the main problems, the first one being the most important. 1) Bounded Gap Conjecture. Are there infinitely many bounded gaps between primes?  2) Suppose that primes have a level of distribution larger than 1/2. Does a fixed h exists such that for every k there is a k-term AP of generalised twin prime pairs (p, p+h)? 3) Erd&#195;&#180;s'  conjecture for k=3.

The existence of silica biomorphs has questioned the use morphology as an unambiguous criterion for detection of primitive life remnants. Beyond applications, the study of silica biomorphs has revealed a totally new morphogenetic mechanism capable of creating crystalline materials with positive or negative constant curvature and biomineral-like textures which lead to the design of new pathways towards concerted morphogenesis and bottom-up self-assembly created by a self-triggered chemical coupling mechanism. The potential interest of these fascinating structures in Earth Sciences has never been explored mostly because of their complexity and multidisciplinary nature. PROMETHEUS proposes an in depth investigation of the nature of mineral structures such as silica biomorphs and chemical gardens, and the role of mineral self-organization in extreme alkaline geological environments. The results will impact current understanding of the early geological and biological history of Earth by pushing forward the unexplored field of inorganic biomimetic pattern formation.

We will obtain a quantitative estimate of the amount of convective mixing and of the internal rotation profile for a broad range of stellar masses and evolutionary states, with specific emphasis on massive stars and on red giant stars. This will be done using new seismic data assembled by the space missions MOST, CoRoT and Kepler, which have a factor 1000 better precision than the ground-based data we had to rely on so far.  2. We will include, for the first time, the effect of a radiation-driven stellar wind on the theoretical description of stellar oscillations.  This opens a new avenu: the seismic calibration of  stellar evolution models of the most massive stars from the core-hydrogen burning up to the supernova stage. 3. We will build a new dedicated camera, MAIA, for the Mercator telescope at La Palma (Canary Islands), to investigate the badly understood common envelope phase of close binary stars. There are large unknowns in their evolution, mainly during the red giant phase when the two stellar components may share a common envelope. The recently discovered pulsating subdwarf O and B binaries must have lost their hydrogen envelope during a common envelope phase near the tip of the red giant branch. We will put tight seismic constraints on their outer hydrogen layer and mass and use these two diagnostics to perform a critical evaluation of close binary evolution theory along the giant branch. Our project encompasses engineering, observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics, time series analysis and statistical clustering. It will revolutionise stellar evolution theory for a variety of stars and all topics in astrophysics that build on it.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PSOPA"><Rcn>102086</Rcn><Nid>10425</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Phase-sensitive optical parametric amplifiers</Name><PI>Peter Avo Andrekson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Optical amplifiers are essential in optical communication systems as they compensate loss induced by the transmission fiber ensuring signal integrity of the information being transmitted, as well as in other applications such as spectroscopy.

This research proposal deals with phase-sensitive optical parametric amplifiers (PSA) that have unique and superior properties compared with all other optical amplifiers, most notably the potential of noiseless amplification, very broad optical bandwidth, and being an enabler of a range of ultrafast all-optical functionalities. In communication, there is an urgent need to develop new technologies that can break the &#226;&#128;&#152;nonlinear Shannon capacity limit&#226;&#128;&#153;, which is considered a serious barrier for continued capacity increase needed to meet the exponentially growing demand for bandwidth. The use of PSAs is expected to be an essential part of this development.

The objective is to unleash the unexplored potential of PSAs by generating knowledge and implementing experimental demonstrations that go substantially beyond current state-of-the-art. This involves a mix of engineering and scientific challenges with telecom and non-telecom applications in mind. We will leverage advances in other areas e.g. low loss photonic crystal fibers and highly nonlinear materials to realize compact PSAs with unprecedented performance. Specifically, we will demonstrate:

By phase transition, a key concept for the proposal, we mean here an abrupt, qualitative change in the properties of the model when its parameters are changed. Mathematically, phase transitions are signaled by the appearance of different probability measures describing the possible states of the system but they are also signaled by a dramatic change in the convergence time of certain Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that are used to sample from the probability distribution of the sample. Systems of this type are well known and studied in statistical physics, but in the last decade their importance has been recognized in other frontier areas of scientific research, such as biology, genetics or theoretical computer science. At the same time it is widely recognized that a deep mathematical understanding of the behavior of these systems is essential. The latter requires the development and use of powerful probabilistic ideas and techniques. Probability is, in fact, the basis of a common language, that allows the sharing, adaptation and combination of key notions and techniques from the different areas involved. Around these topics and guided by the PI a small group of young and brilliant researchers formed in the last years and later developed into a somewhat larger team whose members are all very active and tightly collaborating, with already several important results which opened new directions and perspectives. I propose to build up on these advances by gathering around the host institution the team and guide it to further research on the interplay between equilibrium and dynamical aspects of phase transitions in large-scale structures.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,248,067</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2012-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PUSHBOUND"><Rcn>95017</Rcn><Nid>9005</Nid><HI>Universita Della Svizzera Italiana, Switzerland</HI><Name>Pushing the Boundaries of Molecular Dynamics Simulations</Name><PI>Michele Parrinello</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Atomistic computer simulation has established itself as one of the most important methodologies in modern science, its impact being felt in areas as diverse as physics, chemistry, geophysics, materials science and biophysics, to name but a few. Yet in spite of great progress in computer power and algorithms, we are still not able to simulate such important phenomena as nucleation, phase transitions or protein folding. The purpose of this proposal is to strongly push back the limits of length, time scale and accuracy of present-day methods, greatly enhancing the scope of atomistic simulations. We expect the impact of a successful outcome of this proposal to revolutionize the field. We shall make use of three technical innovations: an extension of Langevin-type equations to include correlated (colored) noise; the use of h-matrices to speed up electronic structure calculations; and an intelligent use of neural networks. Our strategy will be complex. We plan to speed up ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations considerably and also to generate new and highly accurate effective potentials based on electronic structure calculations. A large part of our effort will be devoted to the time scale problem. In this respect we shall improve metadynamics so that its implementation becomes as general and as automatic as possible, and we shall also introduce methods for reconstructing the real dynamics from metadynamics. Finally, highly innovative and powerful sampling methods based on specially designed colored noise Langevin equations will be developed.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PantaRhei"><Rcn>106890</Rcn><Nid>9689</Nid><HI>European Centre For Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Interdisciplinary Integrated Forecasting System for Fluid Flows</Name><PI>Piotr Krzysztof Smolarkiewicz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>A high performance modelling system is proposed for simulating multi-scale flows with an unprecedented range of multidisciplinary physical applications. Computer simulations of global weather at horizontal resolutions in the order of a kilometre (i.e. nonhydrostatic) will become operational for numerical weather prediction (NWP) beyond 2020. Existing NWP models operate at hydrostatic scales and are not equipped to resolve convective motions where nonhydrostatic effects dominate, thus impairing the fidelity of forecasts. While NWP strives to extend the skill towards finer scales, nonhydrostatic research models endeavour to extend their realm towards the global domain. The two routes of development must cross, but the approach how to merge the diverse expertise is far from obvious. The proposed work will synthesise the complementary skills of two exceptionally successful modelling systems: ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) and the nonhydrostatic research model EULAG formulated by the principal investigator. The IFS is one of the most comprehensive Earth-system models available in the world, while EULAG offers unprecedented expertise in multidisciplinary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) ranging from simulations of laboratory flows to magneto-hydrodynamics of solar convection. The essence of the proposal is a pioneering numerical approach, where a nonhydrostatic global model is conditioned by global hydrostatic solutions within a single code framework. The key technology are EULAG's numerical procedures expressed in time-dependent generalized curvilinear coordinates, pairing the mathematical apparatus of general relativity with modern CFD. The new model will predict with greater fidelity extreme weather events that are critical to the protection of society while sustaining Europe&#226;&#128;&#153;s role as the world leader in operational NWP. Moreover, this model will be one of the most advanced computing tools available to the European community for research and education.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>999,559</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PhaseNanoCracker"><Rcn>102187</Rcn><Nid>9940</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>The Metallurgical Nutcracker: Probing at the Nanoscale the Structure and Properties of Hard Second Phases in Alloys and Composites</Name><PI>Andreas Mortensen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Our ambition is to probe the strength of &#226;&#128;&#156;second&#226;&#128;&#157; phases in multiphase metal alloys and composites, meaning of hard particles added to strengthen a metal, or alternatively of brittle inclusions that weaken it. Such phases are ubiquitous in structural metals; yet not much is known of the microstructural features that govern their strength.
The underlying hypothesis of this project is that defects that limit the strength of such hard second phases can be identified and then altered by processing. Motivations for this enquiry stem from our previous research on metal composites, coupled with the fact that modern methods of nanoscale mechanical characterization now make such a quest feasible.
Operationally, we plan to apply and extend nanomechanical testing to probe the strength of micrometric, irregularly shaped, hard particles currently used to strengthen metals. We aim to test such particles whole, and also for their local internal properties. Testing will rely on focused ion beam machining and adapted mechanical nanoprobing. These techniques will be combined to probe, using nanoindentation and original testing procedures, local and global strength values for hard second phase particles. Materials systems to be investigated are: (i) ceramic particles for the reinforcement of metal composites; (ii) silicon in aluminium, (iii) cementite and MC carbides in steel. Defects limiting the strength of these hard brittle phases suggested by nanoscopic mechanical testing will be identified using in-depth microstructural characterization, by electron microscopy notably, of both virgin and tested particles. The data will be supplemented by mechanical testing of macroscopic samples containing the hard particles in question. Processing routes will be explored, towards identification of strategies by which the strength of such second phases can be improved to improve, in turn, the performance of several important engineering materials.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PhysBoil"><Rcn>98010</Rcn><Nid>12259</Nid><HI>Universiteit Twente, Netherlands</HI><Name>Physics of liquid-vapor phase transition</Name><PI>Detlef Lohse</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Liquid-vapor phase transitions and boiling are omnipresent in science and technology, but, as far as basic understanding of the hydrodynamics, these phenomena remain ""terra incognita''. The objective of the proposed work is to achieve a fundamental understanding of the fluid dynamics and heat transfer of the liquid-vapor phase transition - in particular of boiling - both on a micro- and on a macro-scale, through experiments under well-defined and controlled conditions, accompanied by theoretical and numerical modeling. Up to now ""boiling'' has been nearly exclusively an engineering subject. We want to change this and make it a physics subject as we are convinced that boiling involves very interesting and practically relevant physics still in need of understanding.

On the micro-scale the planned experiments include nucleation studies of individual and interacting vapor bubbles on superheated, geometrically and chemically micro- and nano-structured surfaces. In the bulk of the flow, nucleation will be achieved through laser heating, through local pressure gradients, and through acoustically triggered vaporization of metastable perfluorcarbon nanodroplets in a superheated liquid. The vapor bubbles will be monitored with ultra-high-speed digital imaging, micro particle velocimetry, infrared thermography, and heat flux measurements. On the theoretical side we will use molecular dynamics simulations and the level-set method.

On the macro-scale the focus is on closed boiling turbulent flows, namely Rayleigh-Benard and Taylor-Couette flow. We will measure how the vapor bubble formation affects global quantities such as the heat flux and the angular momentum flux and thus the drag, and local flow properties such as the vapor bubble concentration. The numerical simulations, with one generic code for both geometries, will be based on discrete particle models."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,108,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PotentialTheory"><Rcn>97564</Rcn><Nid>12267</Nid><HI>Szegedi Tudomanyegyetem, Hungary</HI><Name>Potential theoretic methods in approximation and orthogonal polynomials</Name><PI>Vilmos Totik</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The project is aimed at systematic applications of potential theoretical

Because there is a unique complexity to mechanical properties of metals: the strength, hardening, embrittlement, fracture, and fatigue are controlled by multi-defect interactions (dislocations/solutes/precipitates/grain boundaries).  However, such multi-defect interactions are beyond the scope of analytical elasticity theory, and thus require a deeper inquiry at atomistic and quantum scales.  And observed macroscopic mechanical behaviour arises from the collective interactions among such defects over large length and time scales.  The PI will tackle the fundamental challenge of the multi-defect, multi-scale problem in metal alloys through a combined theory/simulation effort that will push forward the frontiers of computational metallurgy and yield new, quantitative, predictive models of the mechanical performance of metals alloys that will accelerate metal design.  Three specific thrusts are proposed to predict the role of solute chemistry on : (i) fundamental dislocation phenomena, and the resulting effects on plastic flow and ductility (Solute/Dislocation/Dislocation interactions); (ii) dislocation transmission/absorption and damage nucleation along boundaries (Solute/Grain-boundary/Dislocation interactions); and (iii) the propagation of cracks under monotonic and fatigue loading (Solute/Crack/Dislocation/Grain-boundary interactions).  Small-scale Quantum, Atomistic, and/or Dislocation-level simulations will be designed to probe mechanistic concepts and to validate new predictive theories and new material constitutive models.  This approach is now feasible due to new multiscale modeling techniques developed by the PI and his recent quantitative models that resolve long-standing problems in metallurgy.  The theories and models emerging from this research will allow for generalization of the mechanisms across metals, and will enable the enhancement and design of new metal alloys.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,347,920</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Probiotiqus"><Rcn>106362</Rcn><Nid>9502</Nid><HI>Universitat Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Processing of biomolecular targets for interferometric quantum experiments</Name><PI>Markus Arndt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Recent studies in Vienna have shown that surprising quantum phenomena, such as matter-wave interferometry with molecules composed of hundreds of covalently bound atoms, are actually feasible.

PROBIOTIQUS will now be the first project world-wide to develop experimental tools for matter-wave physics with large biomolecules from amino acid clusters up to proteins and self-replicating molecules.

First, we shall exploit the full potential of coherent molecule metrology for biomolecules, and molecules in a biomimetic environment.  This research connects quantum physics with chemistry and biophysics, since already a restricted number of precisely determined geometrical, electrical, magnetic or optical properties may provide tell-tale analytical information. Embedding the biomolecules in a hydrate layer will allow us to study their properties in a context that approaches the &#226;&#128;&#152;natural&#226;&#128;&#153; environment.

Second, we will develop molecular beam methods, optical manipulation tools and detection schemes to prepare proteins and other large biomolecules for advanced quantum experiments. This includes new laser-assisted acoustic and thermal volatilization methods, slowing and focusing in optical forces, diffraction at ionization and neutralization gratings as well as tagging of proteins with ionizable small biomolecules.

Third, we will prepare a cryogenic biomolecular sample in a buffer-gas loaded ion trap, where optical ionization and neutralization will be optimized in order to enable optical diffraction gratings. The target temperature of 10 K will be the starting point for interference experiments with proteins and self-replicating RNA, on the way towards full viruses.

Quantum interference with large biomolecules at the edge to life has remained an outstanding challenge throughout the last two decades.

cannot make greater strides in the practice of formal methods:
hardware and software devices with errors are routinely turned against
their users.  The ProofCert proposal aims at building a foundation
that will allow a broad spectrum of formal methods---ranging from
automatic model checkers to interactive theorem provers---to work
together to establish formal properties of computer systems.  This
project starts with a wonderful gift to us from decades of work by
logicians and proof theorist: their efforts on logic and proof has
given us a universally accepted means of communicating proofs between
people and computer systems.  Logic can be used to state desirable
security and correctness properties of software and hardware systems
and proofs are uncontroversial evidence that statements are, in fact,
true.  The current state-of-the-art of formal methods used in
academics and industry shows, however, that the notion of logic and
proof is severely fractured: there is little or no communication
between any two such systems.  Thus any efforts on computer system
correctness is needlessly repeated many time in the many different
systems: sometimes this work is even redone when a given prover is
upgraded.  In ProofCert, we will build on the bedrock of decades of
research into logic and proof theory the notion of proof certificates.
Such certificates will allow for a complete reshaping of the way that
formal methods are employed.  Given the infrastructure and tools
envisioned in this proposal, the world of formal methods will become
as dynamic and responsive as the world of computer viruses and hackers
has become.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,201,589</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QCDMat"><Rcn>99658</Rcn><Nid>9232</Nid><HI>Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, France</HI><Name>Strongly Coupled QCD Matter</Name><PI>Jean-Paul Blaizot</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This project addresses fundamental issues in the study of nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energy, such as the thermodynamics of matter at extremely high temperature, or the dynamics of the dense system of gluons that constitute most of the wave-function of a nucleus at asymptotically high energy. In either case, one is dealing with strongly interacting systems whose description requires the development of new theoretical tools.

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the USA has deeply changed our vision of hot and  dense matter, revealing for instance that the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions behaves as a strongly coupled liquid with a relatively small viscosity. Soon, beams of lead nuclei will be accelerated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, with energies exceeding by more than one order of magnitude those of RHIC. New phenomena are likely to be observed, and one of the goals of the project is to develop the theoretical tools that will be needed to understand these phenomena: by developing new, non perturbative methods of quantum field theory in order to calculate the properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the initial nuclear wavefunctions; by providing the appropriate theoretical frameworks to interpret the data and possibly suggest new measurements.

computer security, based on the manipulation of individual qubits. The
realization of large scale quantum computing, involving multitudes of
qubits is still a technological challenge, beyond the scope of this

Quantum computing originated, understandably, in physics.  This
project abstracts from this physical level and will transform and
develop the relevant phenomena at a mathematical level so that they
can be integrated in computational models, logics and formal methods
used in computer science. The project will use the unifying language
and tools of category theory, which are working as a ``Rosetta Stone''
in the multi-disciplinary area of computer science, mathematics and
physics. The project will clarify the subtle but fundamental
difference between quantum computation/logic on the one hand and
probabilistic and non-deterministic computation/logic on the
other. This should result in (programming) logics and models that are

They also offer unique opportunities to perform experimental measurements with high precision. This project aims to theoretically explore novel dynamic and transport properties of quantum gases at both finite and zero temperature, with special emphasis on the effects of quantum statistics, superfluidity and the role of interactions. The major goal is to achieve a deeper understanding of several fundamental issues: the universal properties exhibited by dilute quantum gases; the role of viscosity in non-uniform configurations; the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo techniques to explore the dynamics and transport properties of Bose and Fermi gases; the concept of superfluidity in systems far from equilibrium; the motion of impurities embedded in quantum baths, their interaction and the consequences on the dynamic behaviour; the collective excitations exhibited by novel quantum phases like binary mixtures of quantum gases and dipolar atomic and molecular gases; the effects of disorder; the condensed matter analogues of gravitational physics; the study of self-trapping and Josephson oscillations in superfluid Bose and  Fermi gases.

In this proposal, we aim to combine the investigation of fundamental questions with the development of micro-optics technology to reach a new level of both quantum information experiments and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.  We propose to utilize the advanced development of micro-optics to build novel integrated quantum optics photonic chips. High quality micro-optics will allow precise control over many properties, including birefringence, dispersion, periodicity, and even absorptive properties. We will combine this with novel highly efficient detectors, hopefully, in the long run, also integrated into the same microchips.  By their very nature, the new multi-mode devices will make new higher-dimensional regions of Hilbert space and new types of multi-photon entanglement accessible to experiment. Such devices will enable many new fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics, such as, to give just one example, exploring quantum complementarity both between different numbers of photons and as a function of Hilbert space dimension with significant mathematical implications. Most importantly, we are convinced that many new ideas will arise throughout the project.

A single nanoparticle will be captured  by the gradient force of a focused laser beam in ultrahigh vacuum and its center-of-mass motion will be controlled by optical back-action. To cool the nanoparticle to its quantum ground state we will explore  active parametric feedback cooling in combination with  passive cavity-based  cooling.

A laser-trapped nanoparticle is physically decoupled from its environment, which guarantees extremely long coherence times and quality factors as high as 10^11 in ultrahigh vacuum. Force sensitivities of 10^(-20) Newtons in a bandwidth of 1 Hz can be achieved, which outperforms other measurement techniques by orders of magnitude. In this project, we will use a laser-trapped nanoparticle as a local probe for measuring mesoscopic interactions, such as Casimir forces, vacuum friction, non-equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions, with unprecedented accuracy.

We will also measure the dynamics of nanoparticles in double-well potentials created by two laser beams with closely spaced foci. A pair of trapped nanoparticles defines a highly controllable coupled-oscillator model, which can be used for studying strong coupling, level splitting, and adiabatic energy transfer at the quantum - classical  barrier.

A nanoparticle cooled to its quantum ground state opens up a plethora of fundamental studies, such as the collapse of quantum superposition states under the influence of noise and gravity-induced quantum state reduction.

Motivated by potential applications in quantum information processing, the research in this field has focused on isolating a single confined spin from its environment and implementing coherent manipulation. On the other hand, it has been realized that the principal decoherence mechanisms for confined spins, stemming from interactions with nuclear or electron spin reservoirs, are intimately linked to fascinating many-body condensed-matter physics. We propose to use quantum optical techniques to investigate physics of nanostructures in two opposite but equally interesting regimes, where reservoir couplings are either suppressed to facilitate coherent control or enhanced to promote many body effects. The principal focus of our investigation of many-body phenomena will be on the first observation of optical signatures of the Kondo effect arising from exchange coupling between a confined spin and an electron spin reservoir. In addition, we propose to study nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum dot nuclear spins as well as strongly correlated system of interacting polaritons in coupled nano-cavities. To minimize spin decoherence and to implement quantum control, we propose to use nano-cavity assisted optical manipulation of two-electron spin states in double quantum dots; thanks to its resilience against spin decoherence, this system should allow us to realize elementary quantum information tasks such as spin-polarization conversion and spin entanglement. In addition to indium/gallium arsenide based structures, we propose to study semiconducting carbon nanotubes where hyperfine interactions that lead to spin decoherence can be avoided. Our nanotube experiments will focus on understanding the elementary quantum optical properties, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating coherent optical spin manipulation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,300,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QORE"><Rcn>89066</Rcn><Nid>9503</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; De Gen&#195;&#168;ve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Quantum Correlations</Name><PI>Nicolas Gisin</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In all sciences one observes correlations and develops and tests theoretical models describing them. Quantum correlations are produced by measurements on entangled quantum states. Since they may violate some Bell inequality even when the different parties are space-like separated, they can t be described with the usual tools: common causes and communication. Violation of a Bell inequality is the signature of quantumness: all other entanglement witnesses depend on assumptions about the dimension of the relevant Hilbert spaces. The vision of this project is that nonlocal quantum correlations provide new resources without any equivalence in other sciences. The core objectives are to better understand, manipulate and exploit nonlocal quantum correlations. This project covers aspects in theoretical, experimental and applied physics, with an emphasis on fundamental questions. The goal is to improve our understanding of quantum nonlocality as a resource (different from entanglement) and to improve our ability to harness entanglement over long distances, both for intellectual and applied motivations. The tools are the conceptual nonlocal box borrowed from theoretical computer science, quantum optics at telecom wavelengths and rare-earth ion doped crystals as atomic ensemble based quantum memories.

Optical microscopy is still the workhorse of biological and medical research, allowing researchers direct visible view of the microscopic world, and any improvement in the field could have significant impact. Several innovative techniques have been demonstrated in recent years to achieve super resolution, most relate to fluorescence microscopy and requires highly nonlinear excitations and/or novel fluorescence probes, and therefore have more specific applications.
Our goal is to demonstrate a general-purpose machine, that is, a microscope that should be able to inspect general transparent or fluorescent objects, in particular biological and medical specimens, and will include several observation modalities. The high-resolution capabilities of the microscope will come from the application of novel photon-number resolving detectors and non-classical light sources. Our strategy is to build this microscope around a standard laser scanning microscope concept, yet we will achieve sub-diffraction imaging by resolving features within the classical diffraction limited spot of the scanning beam. Fast photon-number resolving detectors will record spatial and temporal distributions of photons at the image plane, enabling quantum correlations for enhanced resolution. We will consider several forms of illuminations   both classical and quantum light   and several microscope modalities, including fluorescence, dark field and differential interference contrast microscopy. We shall also investigate methods to combine quantum microscopy with nonlinear microscopy for further enhancement of resolution.

It becomes possible to develop a Quantum Atom Optics (QAO), which is more than a simple analogue to PQO. Atoms add two new ingredients to the situations (i) controlled interactions, tunable from zero to giant values; (ii) the possibility to choose between fermions and bosons. The first part of this project aims at revisiting with this new perspective some milestones of Quantum Optics, and to address open questions like possible interaction induced decoherence effects. For this, we will develop single atom detectors and atom-atom correlation measurements techniques, both for metastable Helium and for alkali atoms, and build all optical cooling machines for these species, including a guided atom laser with control of the atomic interactions. We will also consider measurements below the standard quantum limits, to apply them to inertial and gravitational sensors based on atom interferometers.

In the second part of this project, experimental tools and concepts of QAO will be used to address fundamental questions of Condensed Matter Physics (CMP). A 1D horizontally guided Atom Laser will allow us to study transport properties of an interacting Bose gas in the presence of disorder, akin to conductivity measurements in CMP. Atom-atom correlation techniques developed to test Bell inequalities will allow us to investigate non trivial symmetries in paired atomic states BCS-like. Using larger samples of ultra-cold Bose or Fermi atoms, we will investigate the effect of interactions on Anderson localization in 1D, 2D and 3D, as well as other phenomenon beyond the mean field description, e.g. correlations in strongly interacting 1D quantum gases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,130,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QUANTIF"><Rcn>94564</Rcn><Nid>12282</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Quantitative Multidimensional Imaging of Interfacial Fluxes</Name><PI>Patrick Unwin</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Interfacial physicochemical processes are ubiquitous in chemistry, the life sciences and materials science, underpinning some of the most important scientific and technological challenges of the 21st century. The overarching aim of this proposal is to draw together separate strands of interfacial science by creating a unique holistic approach to the investigation of physicochemical processes and developing principles and methods which have cross-disciplinary application. To understand and optimise interfacial physicochemical processes, the major aspiration is to obtain high resolution pictures of chemical fluxes at a scale commensurate with our understanding of structure. The proposed research will address this need and break new ground by: (a) developing a family of innovative imaging methods capable of quantitatively visualising interfacial fluxes with unprecedented resolution that have wide application; and (b) establishing a common framework applicable to different fields of science through the usage of electrochemical principles. Experimental/instrumentation aspects will be supported by advanced modelling of mass transport-chemical reactivity. The research programme will focus on three distinct and important exemplar topics. (i) Electrochemical processes at new forms of carbon, including carbon nanotubes and graphene, where a major challenge is to identify the active sites for electron transfer. (ii) Membrane transport, where the goal is to identify the true factors controlling passive permeation across bilayer lipid membranes, with implications for understanding membrane function. (iii) Crystal growth/dissolution, where there is a major need to bridge kinetic and structural studies so as to understand the relationship between surface features and local flux.

It is entanglement, closely linked to non-locality, that spans this larger space manifold. Entanglement plays a central role in emerging quantum technology aiming to harvest quantum space. From the experimentalist&#226;&#128;&#153;s point of view working in nanoelectronics, there is no instrument on the shelf yet, that would measure the degree of entanglement. This we would like to change with QUEST.

QUEST is a long term project with the goal to experimentally establish a continuous probe of entanglement generation in the electrical signal of quantum devices. It is set up in two parts: the realization of a highly efficient source of spin-entangled electron pairs and the exploration of different correlation measurements providing a measure of entanglement &#226;&#128;&#156;on the fly&#226;&#128;&#157;.  During the last decade a wealth of theory proposals have appeared, addressing entanglement in electronic devices. The interaction of particles in solid-state devices provides a natural force for the appearance of entanglement. Examples are correlation between electrons and holes in the emission on a tunnel junction, or the &#226;&#128;&#156;naturally&#226;&#128;&#157; occurring Cooper pairs in s-wave superconductors. While first results on the realization of sources of entangled electron pairs have appeared recently, there are no experiments demonstrating entanglement in transport of any of those devices. We aim to change this and propose to implement high-bandwidth current correlation methods up to the forth moment, enabling to test Bell-inequality and quantum state tomo-graphy. Based on our long standing experience in the measurement of second-order correlations in nanodevices, we are well prepared for this very challenging goal."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,350</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QUOWSS"><Rcn>93888</Rcn><Nid>13041</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Quantum Optics in Wavelength Scale Structures</Name><PI>John Rarity</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In this project I will investigate the interaction between quantum light and matter in optical structures that are at or below the wavelength scale.

It describes the world of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons (partons) making up the protons and neutrons and therewith the ordinary matter in our universe. Collisions of protons and heavy nuclei at unprecedented energies in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN enable experiments that will uncover mechanisms and symmetries underlying the Standard Model. In experiments at the LHC, as in many other high-energy physics experiments, QCD plays a crucial role as a toolbox. It employs the property that at very high energies, or equivalently very short distances, the transition of protons to partons is a long distance phenomenon that can be encoded through parton probabilities and decay functions, which incorporate the complex structure of the proton itself.

Earlier I have revealed a new element in QCD: specific momentum-spin correlations can also be encoded in terms of (polarized) parton probabilities, collectively known as transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution and fragmentation functions. Experimental results have confirmed the applicability and the necessity of including the novel correlations in QCD in order to cope with current and upcoming experimental results. This proposal outlines my ambitions to develop the next generation of the QCD toolbox.

I want to break with the restrictions of the collinear approximation for partons in high-energy processes and develop the full QCD dynamics underlying the novel correlations, study their universality and make them into workable tools that enable a full manipulation of spins and momenta of the partons for understanding experimental results at all frontiers, energy and precision. The results of this enterprise will affect the entire field of high-energy/nuclear physics and open up new windows to reveal the fundaments of the Standard Model through dedicated experiments at present-day and future facilities.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,068,946</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QuOMP"><Rcn>93187</Rcn><Nid>12910</Nid><HI>Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola Ab, Sweden</HI><Name>Quantum optics with microwave photons building a tool-box based on superconducting technology</Name><PI>Per Erik Delsing</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The research proposed in this application has grown out of the research on solid-state qubits, where a superconducting circuit including Josephson junctions can be made into a quantum-coherent, two-level system, an artificial atom.

In general, plasmonic devices exploit electromagnetic waves known as surface plasmon polaritons (herein shortened to surface plasmons) that propagate at the surface of a metal. Because these waves allow light to be concentrated in nanometer-scale volumes (hot spots), they can lead to enhanced light-matter interactions. Consequently, plasmonic structures have been studied for various photonic applications. However, because surface plasmons dissipate energy in the metal, intrinsic losses can severely limit light-matter interactions and the performance of plasmonic devices. Therefore, simple routes to counteract losses by adding a gain material to rejuvenate the surface plasmons have been sought. Moreover, by adding sufficient optical gain to a plasmonic resonator, a spaser can be created. This can lead to an extremely versatile nanoscale source of surface plasmons, photons, and/or intense electromagnetic fields.  Therefore, spasers can enable fundamental studies on the limits of nanoscale optics as well as various applications.  Recently, the very first spasers have appeared, leading to many open questions. To help address these, the PI will perform fundamental studies on a broad class of plasmonic devices that incorporate gain.  The proposed research will take advantage of his expertise in two areas: (a) highly fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (colloidal quantum dots) for the gain material and (b) the fabrication of high-quality low-loss patterned metallic films. By combining these, an ideal route to spasers will be pursued. The project will develop designs and fabrication processes to create quantum-dot-decorated plasmonic resonators, and then investigate their gain, amplification, and spasing behavior. Another objective is to develop new approaches to place individual quantum dots at plasmonic hot spots and study their properties.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QuaDynEvoPro"><Rcn>101678</Rcn><Nid>12138</Nid><HI>Scuola Internazionale Superiore Di Studi Avanzati Di Trieste, Italy</HI><Name>Quasistatic and Dynamic Evolution Problems in Plasticity and Fracture</Name><PI>Gianni Dal Maso</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This research project deals with nonlinear evolution problems that arise in the study of the inelastic behaviour of solids, in particular in plasticity and fracture. The project will focus on selected problems, grouped into three main topics, namely:
1. Plasticity with hardening and softening,     2. Quasistatic crack growth,     3. Dynamic fracture mechanics.
The analysis of the models of these mechanical problems leads to deep mathematical questions originated by two common features: the energies are not convex and the solutions exhibit discontinuities both with respect to space and time. In addition, plasticity problems often lead to concentration of the strains, whose mathematical description requires singular measures. Most of these problems have a variational structure and are governed by partial differential equations. Therefore, the construction of consistent models and their analysis need advanced mathematical tools from the calculus of variations, from measure theory and geometric measure theory,  and also from the theory of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. The models of dynamic crack growth considered in the project also need results from the theory of linear hyperbolic equations.
Our goal is to develop new mathematical tools in these areas for the study of the selected problems. Quasistatic evolution problems in plasticity with hardening and softening will be studied through a vanishing viscosity approach, that has been successfully used by the P.I. in the study of the Cam-Clay model in soil mechanics. Quasistatic models of crack growth will be developed under different assumptions on the elastic response of the material and on the mechanisms of crack formation. For the problem of crack growth in the dynamic regime our aim is to develop a model that predicts the crack path as well as the time evolution of the crack along its path, taking into account all inertial effects.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>968,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QuantumOptoElectr"><Rcn>88621</Rcn><Nid>11446</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands</HI><Name>Quantum Opto-Electronics</Name><PI>Leo Kouwenhoven</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We propose to develop an opto-electronics interface between single-electron devices and single-photon optics. The ultimate limit in the miniaturization of electronics and photonics is at the nanometer scale. Here the signal level can be controlled at the fundamental level of a single electron for electricity and a single photon for light. These limits are actively being pursued for scientific interest with possible applications in the new area of quantum information science. Yet, these efforts occur separately in the distinct communities of solid state electronics and quantum optics. Here we propose to develop a toolbox for interfacing electronics and optics on the level of single electrons and photons. The basic building block is a nanoscale pn-junction defined in a semiconductor nanowire, which is the most versatile material system for single electron to single photon conversion. We will develop the following technology: (1) growth of complex semiconductor nanowires (2) quantum state transfer for copying the information stored in an electron quantum state onto a photon state (3) single-photon optical-chip with on-chip guiding via single plasmons and on-chip detection with a superconducting detector.

Quantum criticality describes these fluctuations and their extension to finite temperature. Quantum critical behaviour has been reported in systems as distinct as high-temperature superconductors, metamagnets, multilayer $^3$He films, or heavy fermion compounds. The latter have emerged as prototypical systems in the past few years. A major puzzle represents the recent discovery of a new energy scale in one such system, that vanishes at the quantum critical point and is in addition to the second-order phase transition scale. Completely new theoretical approaches are called for to describe this situation.  In this project we want to explore the nature of this new low-lying energy scale by approaches that go significantly beyond the state-of-the-art: apply multiple extreme conditions in temperature, magnetic field, and pressure, use ultra low temperatures in a nuclear demagnetization cryostat, and perform ultra-low energy spectroscopy, to study carefully selected known and newly discovered heavy fermion compounds.

New approaches in the theoretical description of quantum criticality will accompany the experimental investigations.

Ultracold atoms provide a unique opportunity for studying non-equilibrium quantum systems in the laboratory. The coherent quantum evolution can be observed on experimentally accessible timescales and the tunability in interaction, temperature and dimensionality allows the realization of a multitude of different relevant physical situations.

Through building specific model systems we propose to study a wide variety of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics under conditions ranging from weakly interacting to strongly correlated, from weakly disturbed to quantum turbulent and search for universal properties in non-equilibrium quantum evolution.

We address questions of de-coherence in a split many-body system and the concomitant emergence of classical properties. We will study the fate of the highly entangled quantum states that are created when a system in its excited state decays. Systems with instabilities and controlled quenches will give us insight into the creation of defects and excitations. We will experiment with bosons, fermions and mixtures, and take advantage of the rich internal structure of the atoms. Our systems will also be observed when interacting with &#226;&#128;&#152;baths&#226;&#128;&#153;, which can be internal or external with controlled coupling and can be engineered from simple thermal to squeezed, from large to mesoscopic with non-Markovian properties.

Our ultimate goal is insight into the answers to fundamental questions: What does it take for an isolated many-body quantum system with a set of conserved quantities to relax to an equilibrium state? Which universal properties and scaling laws govern its evolution? Can classical physics and thermodynamics emerge from quantum physics through the dynamics of complex many-body systems?</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,025,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="R3S3"><Rcn>88539</Rcn><Nid>11708</Nid><HI>Stichting Vu-Vumc, Netherlands</HI><Name>Research on Really Reliable and Secure Systems Software</Name><PI>Andrew Stuart Tanenbaum</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Current operating systems have poor reliability and security. Computers crash regularly whereas other electronic devices such as televisions and mobile phones never crash. Furthermore, practically every week one reads about another security hole in Windows. As computers become more essential for all aspects of society this situation is unacceptable. The goal of my proposed research is to conceive, design, implement, and test an operating system that is as reliable and secure as is humanly possible. The job will be finished when the average user has never experienced a crash in his lifetime and RESET buttons on computers have passed into history, like 5&#194;&#188; -inch floppy disks.       The basic concept I want to use to achieve a reliable, secure operating system is the POLA The Principle of Least Authority. The operating system will be moved out the kernel (where it has unrestricted access to all of memory, critical machine instructions the I/O devices) into a set of multiple, tightly constrained user processes. Each process (e.g., a file server) will be given exactly the authority it needs to do its job and no more. This mechanism ensures that problems in one process cannot spill over into other ones. While this goal has floated around for years, no one really knows how to do it, so research is needed. Furthermore, I also want to make the system fault tolerant and self healing so it can continue to run even in the presence of hardware and software errors. Recovery should be done automatically without affecting running programs.      Designing and building a new operating system that runs counter to 50 years of experience is extremely ground-breaking and ambitious. But the current road we are on with millions of lines of code in the kernel and growing all the time cannot be sustained. We need research that will lead to much better reliability and security. I have 30 years experience in the field and think I have a chance to pull it off."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,448,420</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RACE"><Rcn>101683</Rcn><Nid>9942</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Reasoning About Computational Economies</Name><PI>Michael John Wooldridge</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of this project is to develop, apply, and evaluate RACE: a robust and practical model checking tool for use in the formal specification, verification, and analysis of computational economies &#226;&#128;&#147; computer systems in which system components are assumed to have their own goals/preferences about the overall behaviour of the system, and where these system components are assumed to behave selfishly and strategically in the furtherance of their goals/preferences.

A pioneering vision of E. Wigner was that the distribution of the gaps between energy levels of complicated quantum systems depends only on the basic symmetry of the model and is otherwise independent of the physical details. This thesis has never been rigorously proved
for any realistic physical system but experimental data and extensive numerics leave no doubt as to its correctness. Wigner also discovered that the statistics of gaps can be modelled by eigenvalues of large random matrices. Thus the natural questions, &#226;&#128;&#156;How do energy levels behave?&#226;&#128;&#157; and &#226;&#128;&#156;What do eigenvalues of a typical large matrix look like?&#226;&#128;&#157;, have surprisingly the same answer! This project will develop new tools to respond to the two main challenges that Wigner&#226;&#128;&#153;s vision poses for mathematics.
First, prove that a large class of natural systems exhibits universality. The simplest model is the
random matrix itself, for which the original conjecture, posed almost fifty years ago, has recently been solved by the PI and coworkers. This breakthrough opens up the route to the universality for more realistic physical systems such as random band matrices, matrices with correlated entries and random Schr&#195;&#182;dinger operators. Second, eigenvalue statistics will be used to detect the basic dichotomy of disordered quantum systems, the Anderson metal-insulator transition. Third, describe the properties of the strongly correlated eigenvalues viewed as a point process.
Although this process appears as ubiquitous in Nature as the Poisson process or the Brownian motion, we still know only very little about it. Due to the very strong correlations, the standard toolboxes of probability theory and statistical mechanics are not applicable. The main impact of the
project is a conceptual understanding of spectral universality and the development of robust analytical tools to study strongly correlated systems."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,754,717</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RATIONAL POINTS"><Rcn>89297</Rcn><Nid>12045</Nid><HI>Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Fundamental groups, etale and motivic, local systems, Hodge theory and rational points</Name><PI>H&#195;&#169;l&#195;&#168;ne Esnault</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>From the viewpoint of geometric classification, there are two extreme cases of smooth varieties X defined over an algebraically closed field: those which are hyperbolic, and those which are rationally connected.  If k is no longer algebraically closed, a central question of Algebraic Arithmetic Geometry is what properties of k force  X to have a rational point in those two opposed cases.   It is conjectured (Lang-Manin, extended by Koll&#195;&#161;r), that rationally connected varieties have a rational point over a C1 field. It has been shown for function fields by Graber-Harris-Starr  and by myself over a finite field. There is no relation between their geometric proof relying on the geometry of the moduli of punctured curves and my proof relying on motivic analogies between Hodge level and slopes in l-adic cohomology. The study of the case of the maximal unramified extension of the p-adic numbers might provide a bridge through the use of the inertia.  Very little is known on Grothendieck's section conjecture, which predicts that sections of the Galois group of k, assumed to be a finite type over Q,  into the arithmetic fundamental group of X, are given by rational points. Our hope goes in two directions, arithmetic and geometric on one side, motivic on the other.  With Wittenberg, we hope to use Beilinson's geometric description of the nilpotent completion of the fundamental group, and with Levine, we wish to characterize sections of the motivic groups of mixed Tate motives over k and X and relate this to the section conjecture.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>894,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REALTIME"><Rcn>93003</Rcn><Nid>12067</Nid><HI>Centre Internacional De Metodes Numerics En Enginyeria, Spain</HI><Name>Real Time Computational Mechanics Techniques for Multi-Fluid Problems</Name><PI>Sergio Idelsohn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The simultaneous presence of several different fluids in external or internal flows is found in daily life, environment and numerous industrial processes.

Currently THERE ARE NO SUCH INDUSTRIAL PROCESS AVAILABLE and 0% WASTE RECYCLING of RARE EARTH ELEMENTS (REE). Plus,  97% of the mining operations are performed in China, hence representing a major Sword of Damocl&#195;&#168;s for the rest of the world&#226;&#128;&#153;s economy.

We propose to develop a new, cost effective and environmentally friendly REE recycling process. We will achieve this: (i) by enabling, for the first time ever, the fast measurement of free energy of mass transfer between complex fluids; hence it will now be possible to explore an extensive number of process formulations and phase diagrams (such a study usually takes years but will then be performed in a matter of days); (ii)  develop predictive models of ion separation  including the effect of  long-range interactions between metal cations and micelles; (iii) by using the experimental results and prediction  tools developed, to design an advanced &amp; environmentally friendly process formulations and pilot plant; (iv) by enhancing the extraction kinetics and selectivity, by implementing a new, innovative and selective triggering cation exchange process step (ca. the exchange kinetics of a cation will be greatly enhance when compared to another one). This will represent a major breakthrough in the field of transfer methods between complex fluids.

An expected direct consequence of REE-CYCLE will be that acids&#226;&#128;&#153; volumes and other harmful process wastes, will be reduced by one to two orders of magnitude.

In the present research proposal we will select problems from combinatorics and number theory (including additive combinatorics), where regularity and irregularity appear. In some cases we have to deal, e.g., with arbitrary finite or infinite subsets of natural numbers, where the only information we have is  their cardinality, namely, that they are of positive (lower asymptotic) density within the set of all natural numbers or within the interval [1,N] for a large N. In other cases we consider an arbitrary distribution of n points within the unit square, where all we know is the density of our point set. The goal is often to show that certain configurations appear within the arbitrary set of numbers or points. These configurations definitely appear in a random set of numbers or points, but we have to show this for an arbitrary set of numbers or points with certain general properties. In order to reach our goal one can use two well-known methods. The first one is deterministic, often some kind of greedy algorithm. The second is the probabilistic method of Erd&#197;&#145;s, which shows that almost all arrangements of the given points or numbers (or graphs) fulfill the wanted property. A third method, the so called pseudorandom method, was initiated by the PI (together with M. Ajtai and J. Koml&#195;&#179;s), uses a combination of these. In other cases we have a deterministic set of numbers with certain quasi-random properties, for example, the primes. Randomness was the key idea in the recent breakthrough of Green and Tao, in proving that primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. We will deal with 6 groups of problems: (i) finite or infinite sequences of integers, (ii) difference sets and Fourier analysis, (iii) graph and hypergraph embedding theorems, (iv) Ramsey theory, (v) distribution of points in the plane and in the unit square, (vi) regularities and irregularities in the distribution of primes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,776,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REMOCEAN"><Rcn>94561</Rcn><Nid>11515</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Remotely sensed biogeochemical cycles in the ocean</Name><PI>Herv&#195;&#169; Claustre</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"In the context of global change and ocean response to climatic and anthropogenic forcing, it is critical to improve our understanding of biologically mediated carbon fluxes and to reduce the uncertainties in their estimates.

" Development of profiling floats to measure oceanic variables essential for the characterization of phytoplankton dynamics and related carbon fluxes.

This novel programme of work will take paradigms from one-dimensional dynamics to apply to the higher-dimensional case. In so doing, it will answer a number of long-standing questions of major significance and open up the field for sustained future investigation. The current emphasis on conformal (complex-analytic) techniques will be supplemented in the higher-dimensional setting by drawing on a combination of techniques from dynamics, geometry and analysis.

But our vision of the rheology is blurred because gaps exist between visions of geologists, experimentalists and modellers. Geologists describe the evolution of a structure at regional-scale within geological durations. Specialists of experimental rheology control most parameters, but laboratory time constants are short and they often work on simple synthetic rocks. Specialists of modelling can choose any time- and space-scales and introduce in the model any parameter, but the resolution of their models is low compared to natural observations, and mixing short-term and long-term processes is uneasy. It seems now clear that there is not one rheological model applicable to all contexts and that rheological parameters should be adapted to each situation. We will work on exhumed crustal-scale shear zones and describe them in their complexity, focussing on strain localisation and high strain structures that can lead to fast slip events. A number of objects will be studied, starting from geological description (3D geometry, P-T-fluids estimates and dating), experimental studies of rheological properties of natural sampled rocks and numerical modelling. We will set an Argon-dating lab to work on dense sampling for dating along strain gradients in order to overcome local artefacts and quantify rates of strain localisation. We will deform in the lab natural rocks taken from the studied objects to retrieve adapted rheological parameters. We will model processes at various scales, from the lab to the lithosphere in order to ensure a clean transfer of rheological parameters from one scale to another.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,645,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RIGIDITY"><Rcn>97654</Rcn><Nid>9886</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique F&#195;&#169;d&#195;&#169;rales De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Rigidity: Groups, Geometry and Cohomology"</Name><PI>Nicolas Monod</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our proposal has three components:

1. Unitarizable representations.

2. Spaces and groups of non-positive curvature.

3. Bounds for characteristic classes.

The three parts are independent and each one is justified by major well-known conjectures and/or ambitious goals. Nevertheless, there is a unifying theme: Group Theory and its relations to Geometry, Dynamics and Analysis.

In the first part, we study the Dixmier Unitarizability Problem. Even though it has remained open for 60 years, it has witnessed deep results in the last 10 years. More recently, the PI and co-authors have obtained new progress. Related questions include the Kadison Conjecture. Our methods are as varied as ergodic theory, random graphs, L2-invariants.

In the second part, we study CAT(0) spaces and groups. The first motivation is that this framework encompasses classical objects such as S-arithmetic groups and algebraic groups; indeed, the PI obtained new extensions of Margulis' superrigidity and arithmeticity theorems. We are undertaking an in-depth study of the subject, notably with Caprace, aiming at constructing the full ""semi-simple theory"" in the most general setting. This has many new consequences even for the most classical objects such as matrix groups, and we propose several conjectures as well as the likely methods to attack them.

In the last part, we study bounded characteristic classes. One motivation is the outstanding Chern Conjecture, according to which closed affine manifolds have zero Euler characteristic. We propose a strategy using a range of techniques in order to either attack the problem or at least obtain new results on simplicial volumes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,332,710</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RIVAL"><Rcn>94091</Rcn><Nid>11413</Nid><HI>Universitat Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Risk and Valuation of Financial Assets: A Robust Approach</Name><PI>Walter Schachermayer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The recent financial crisis has brought to light the importance of correctly evaluating financial assets and their underlying risk. Any such valuation should be robust, i.e., should not be overly sensitive to the modelling assumptions. According to the Black--Scholes theory, which lies at the heart of most current valuation methods, the risk involved by a financial asset can be perfectly eliminated by pursuing a proper dynamic hedging strategy. Unfortunately, although formally elegant, this theory is too much of an idealization of the real world situation. The underlying model fails to be robust in two ways: the prices follow geometric Brownian motion, and transaction costs must be zero. The use of alternative models, e.g. based on fractional Brownian motion, was proposed more than 45 years ago by B.~Mandelbrot. The empirical findings give support to the use of such alternative models. Nevertheless, up to now these models could not be used to value financial assets, as they are not free of arbitrage. We propose an approach which makes it possible to value financial assets in an arbitrage free way, even in the framework of fractal models, by properly taking transaction costs into account. Our approach is based on utility theory. We also propose to control the risk of the related hedging strategies by imposing bounds in terms of risk measures. This allows for more realistic financial modelling with special emphasis on the aspect of the residual risk, remaining after hedging. From a mathematical point of view, our approach is based on the duality theory of infinite-dimensional optimization.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,266,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RLUCIM"><Rcn>89295</Rcn><Nid>13107</Nid><HI>The University Of Liverpool, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Resilient large unit cell inorganic materials</Name><PI>Matthew Rosseinsky</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>A grand challenge in science is the controlled assembly of atoms and molecules into novel forms as the basis for new physical phenomena and next-generation technologies.

The targeted synthesis of these materials is addressed by developing a  smart intuition  approach in which detailed chemical appreciation of the structure-composition-property relationships is focused by predictive computation.

Theme 1 initially addresses the assembly of modular thin film and bulk materials to permit the required methodology development. Theme 2 will identify a toolkit of chemical components by synthesis and measurement (encompassing both average and local structure and dynamics) that will then be analysed predictively by computation to identify specific compositions for synthesis. The developed capability will integrate computation as a focused tool in the synthesis of complex materials, rather than devising an approach capable of surveying all possible compositions. It will permit the isolation of specific structures within a focused space of components, identified by structure-property-composition analysis in bulk materials (specifically those where structural frustration is imposed by competing interactions between multiple sublattices) or by selection of modules for unit cell by unit cell assembly of thin films.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,291,997</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ROCOCO"><Rcn>97877</Rcn><Nid>12261</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>CONFORMATIONAL COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL</Name><PI>Jonathan Clayden</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We aim to offer to science a molecular scale mechanism for communication and control.

To achieve our aim we will synthesise oligomeric and polymeric compounds with well-defined helical conformations, and use a stereochemical influence located at one terminus to induce a conformational preference (for the left or the right handed form of the helix) which is relayed to a site many nanometres distant.  Precedent suggests that by employing polymeric structures we will achieve control even over micrometre scales.  Simple but powerful new techniques will quantify the remote (on a molecular scale) transmission of information by NMR, circular dichroism spectrophotometry and/or fluorescence. The result of the information relay will be a detectable change in chemical reactivity or binding properties   and one aim will be to vastly increase, by orders of magnitude, the distance over which remote stereochemical control is possible (from the current 2.5 nm to the order of &gt;100 nm).
The feature which distinguishes biology from chemistry is information, and in particular the ability to encode and process information using molecular interactions.  Our project will take a step towards the development of designed chemical structures which can mimic, using far simpler molecules, the function of biological communication systems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,426,106</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ROMY"><Rcn>110538</Rcn><Nid>11466</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>ROtational Motions: a new observable for seismologY</Name><PI>Heiner Igel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"When the ground shakes from earthquakes, the oceans, or the atmosphere, it not only translates (up-down, sideways), but also undergoes rotational motions. To fully characterize seismic sources and wave fields theoreticians have insisted for decades that these motions should also be measured. However, this was hampered by the substantial technical difficulties in observing rotational motions with the necessary sensitivity. This implies that the observation of the complete ground motion is still an unsolved problem. Based on promising pilot studies in the past years, we aim at breaking new ground with an innovative instrumentation strategy that would allow solving this outstanding problem. If the strategy is successful the new observable is expected to have an impact in a wide range of fields making it a classical high-risk high-gain situation. We aim at the establishment of the first-of-its-kind six-component seismic observatory based on ring-laser technology, the field deployment of portable fibre-optic based rotation sensors,  the integration of the  new observations with the global seismological data infrastructure, and the reporting of discoveries in a variety of fields based on the new observable. At the end of the project we expect to have substantially pushed forward the emerging field field of rotational seismology with new standards, and recommendations for the use of rotation sensors in Earth sciences and engineering. We expect advances in understanding 1) the dynamics of volcano&#226;&#128;&#153;s interior, 2) the origin of the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s ocean generated noise field, 3) and seismic inverse problems for structure and source using the new rotational observables.

Sensor array processing methods are commonly used in multi-sensor systems to estimate signal parameters (such as source directions-of-arrival and waveforms), to extract signals-of-interest received on the background of multiple interferers and sensor noise, and to transmit signals to multiple locations in a spatially selective way.  Current sensor array processing techniques are known to degrade severely if some of the exploited assumptions on the environment, sources, or antenna array become wrong or imprecise. In particular, the existing signal parameter estimation and beamforming methods are known to be very sensitive to any type of array manifold or multi-antenna channel mismodeling which may be caused by environmental non-stationarities, signal fading and scattering effects, array shape distortions, imperfect array calibration, unknown ambient colored noise, etc. As a result, advanced sensor array processing techniques can suffer a severe performance degradation in situations with even rather slight mismatches between the actual and presumed array responses. Therefore, robust sensor array processing techniques are currently of great demand. The main objective of the proposed research will be to develop new robust and computationally efficient sensor array signal processing methods for signal parameter estimation and receive and transmit adaptive beamforming in complicated environments with imperfectly known array and propagation channel parameters. The robust adaptive array processing and signal parameter estimation techniques developed during this project will be based on an explicit modeling of uncertainties in the array response and robust performance optimization. The proposed methods will provide substantial improvements of the robustness and computational complexity relative to the current array processing techniques.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,531,628</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2012-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ROSEPOT"><Rcn>93586</Rcn><Nid>13045</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Revolutionising Organic Synthesis: Efficient One-Pot Synthesis of Complex Organic Molecules for Non-Experts</Name><PI>Varinder Kumar Aggarwal</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The creation of new molecular entities and subsequent exploitation of their properties is central to a broad spectrum of research disciplines from medicine to materials. However, despite substantial progress, the problems and difficulties associated with chemical syntheses severely limits the development of these disciplines. In order to meet the emerging challenges across new disciplinary boundaries in a rapidly changing scientific landscape we require a step-change in the development of more rapid and robust techniques in organic synthesis. Our plan is to develop new reactions and strategies which enable us to essentially grow a carbon chain with complete control over its shape (stereochemistry) and functionality (which groups are incorporated). Specifically, we propose to create a family of chiral carbanions with good leaving groups attached which can be inserted into C-B bonds sequentially and in one pot so that at the end of the operation a complex natural product, pharmaceutical or material will be produced. Our ultimate vision is to render complex organic synthesis as easy as peptide/oligonucleotide synthesis is now by attaching the boronic esters to a solid support and automating the steps. This would enable complex organic molecules to be accessible even by non-experts in synthesis. Furthermore, by variation of the reagents and their stereochemistry any compound and any stereoisomer will be accessible thus allowing diversity elements to be introduced without additional cost. The impact for organic synthesis and the wider scientific community is immense as it will allow the properties and potential function of complex molecules (from pharmaceuticals to materials) to be studied and then exploited.

The use of biomass and coal derived carbon monoxide as a fundamental building block for simple organic molecules is a key objective in energy research, and the latter, coupled with global warming considerations, dictate that new ways to both activate and derivatise carbon dioxide must also be found. The programme of work described in this proposal tackles these problems through experience and excellence in organometallic chemistry and small molecule activation. It is centred around three closely integrated and synergistic strands. The synthetic work in Strand 1 focuses on reductive assembly of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide on low oxidation state metal centres to build simple organic molecules and rings stoichiometrically. The work in this strand will also be driven by developing a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of these reactions through experiment. A key feature of this proposal is the computational work, which is the subject of Strand 2, in which theory and modelling will be used in an iterative way to predict and inform the experimental synthetic and mechanistic work in Strand 1. Strand 3 will establish the underlying redox properties of these systems using electrochemical techniques, in order to ultimately to generate systems which will catalytically generate organic molecules from carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The program of work described in this proposal, which will deliver stoichiometric and catalytic recycling of carbon oxides, is at the frontier of future sustainable chemical technology. It is therefore of high risk, but ultimately extremely high reward.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,775,222</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RULE"><Rcn>106445</Rcn><Nid>9980</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Rule-Based Modelling</Name><PI>Vincent Nicolas Julien Danos</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The purpose of this research programme is to contribute to the solution of a major problem in today&#226;&#128;&#153;s systems biology: namely, the difficulty to bring mechanistic modelling to bear on full scale systems. Statistical, and experimental techniques have scaled up considerably in the last two decades. Mechanistic modelling, on the other hand, is still confined in much smaller scales. Witness the painstakingly slow scaling up of cellular signalling models, despite their central role in cell response. To address the problem, we build on a new modelling methodology, called the rule-based approach (RB), pioneered by the PI of this proposal, and hailed (in a recent Nature Methods article) as the &#226;&#128;&#156;harbinger of an entirely new way of representing and studying cellular networks&#226;&#128;&#157;. By exploiting the modularity of biological agents, RB breaks through the combinatorial challenge of describing and simulating signalling systems. But with the possibility of writing and running larger models, new questions come to the fore. To bring mechanistic modelling to the next level requires: innovative knowledge representation techniques to anchor modelling in the data-side of systems bi- ology; new means to tame the complexity of, and reason about, the parameter space of models; new concepts to identify meaningful observables in the highly stochastic behaviour of large and combinatorial models; and clean and structured languages to comprehend spatial aspects of the biological phenomenology. The realism accrued by working at larger scales gets one closer to the bottom-up reconstruction of behaviours at the heart of systems biology, and to an understanding of the computational architecture of complex biological networks. This research programme, firmly grounded in the mathematics of programming language semantics and formal methods, extends the RB approach so as to address all of the above needs, and deliver an integrated modelling framework where full scale mechanistic modelling is achievable."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,084,316</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RWPERCRI"><Rcn>93877</Rcn><Nid>9402</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>"Random Walks, Percolation and Random Interlacements"</Name><PI>Alain-Sol Sznitman</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The general theme of this research proposal involves random walks and percolation theory.

Accretion of gas leads to the formation of new stars and the growth of the central massive black hole. In return, the energy released by these processes can drive strong outflows of gas, profoundly affecting the gaseous medium in and around a galaxy. This mechanism of energy feedback is now a key ingredient in models of structure formation. However, its implementation is still largely ad hoc and far from realistic..
Observations of radio AGN suggest that this type of active nucleus can play an important role in feedback. Their large jets and lobes can efficiently couple with the ISM/IGM and transport energy to large distances, preventing gas from cooling and, therefore, providing a self-regulating mechanism for gas accretion.
This proposal requests funding to set up a science team dedicated at explore the full impact of radio AGN on galaxy evolution. The possibility of making a major breakthrough in this field has become possible thanks to two new and revolutionary radio facilities becoming available in Europe: the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), now in its commissioning phase, and the focal-plane array system Apertif to be installed starting 2013 on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). Both instruments use state-of-the-art technology and innovative approaches in all aspects of observing, calibration, processing and in the exploitation of radio data. They are among the most exciting pathfinders geared towards the realization of Square Kilometer Array (SKA).
The scientific goals will be achieved by understanding the duty cycle of radio sources, i.e. how often the radio-loud phase appears in the life of a galaxy, and by quantifying their role in feedback effects by tracing massive gaseous outflows resulting from the impact of radio jets and lobes on the ISM/IGM of the host galaxy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,441,923</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ReaDi"><Rcn>106803</Rcn><Nid>11621</Nid><HI>Ecole Des Hautes Etudes En Sciences Sociales, France</HI><Name>Reaction-Diffusion Equations, Propagation and Modelling</Name><PI>Henri Berestycki</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Our goal is to accomplish a leap forward in the knowledge on propagation phenomena in reaction-diffusion equations, in heterogeneous media and/or non standard diffusion, systems as well as non local interactions. This proposal deals both with the general theory of nonlinear PDE&#226;&#128;&#153;s of elliptic and parabolic type as well as with the development and study of some specific models. These range from ecology, medicine, mathematical economics  and social sciences.

Reaction-diffusion models, especially in ecology (for instance those describing biological invasions), feature long range interactions and heterogeneities, whose understanding is a current outstanding challenge. Models in theoretical medicine couple multi-scale phenomena to complex geometries and mixtures of local and nonlocal interactions. Economy is a constant source of new
and  nonstandard free boundary problems. We therefore propose to bring our expertise in propagation phenomena for reaction-diffusion, calculus of variations and free boundary problems, to treat a large class of these new models. The level of both generality and precision we are aiming at has not, to our knowledge, been reached before.
The project is especially timely: on the one hand, the international activity in reaction-diffusion equations and all related topics is intense. On the other hand, the modelling activity in theoretical biology, ecology, medicine and social sciences is experiencing a considerable growth. The  PI of this proposal being at the leading edge of both fields, there is a unique occasion to give a new impulse to a domain that is important both to mathematical analysis and to its potential applications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,542,055</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ReactionBarriometry"><Rcn>110411</Rcn><Nid>10221</Nid><HI>Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>Towards a chemically accurate description of reactions on metal surfaces</Name><PI>Gerardus Johannes Kroes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal attacks the four major challenges facing theorists who aim to make accurate predictions for reactions of molecules on metal surfaces. The research is curiosity driven, but also of practical importance to an accurate description of heterogeneous catalysis, which enables the production of &gt; 90% of man made chemicals. The central goal is to enable the ab initio computation of chemically accurate barrier heights for reactions with metal surfaces of catalytic interest.
In the first challenge addressed, to establish the accuracy of a new electronic structure method we will test whether specific reaction parameter density functional theory (SRP-DFT) can describe reactions like dissociation of N2 on Ru(0001), CH4 on Pt(111), and H2 on Pt containing surfaces of catalytic interest with chemical accuracy. We will try to put SRP-DFT on a ab initio basis by fitting SRP density functionals to single point Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations. Second, we aim to achieve an accurate description of the effect of surface phonons on reaction through implementing Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics calculations on systems like CHD3 + Pt(111), CH4 + Pt(533), and N2 + Ru(0001). Third, we additionally aim to achieve an accurate description of the effect of electron-hole pair excitation on reaction in systems like N2 + Ru(0001) by implementing a new method called Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics with Electronic Friction, using a novel and efficient way to accurately compute the required friction coefficients. The fourth goal is to achieve an accurate quantum dynamical description of the reaction of hydrogen containing polyatomic molecules at surfaces at incidence energies of catalytic interest (in the quantum regime). The quantum dynamics calculations will treat all molecular degrees of freedom and one surface mode, which will ultimately enable detailed interpretations of recently observed mode-selectivity, bond-selectivity, and steric effects in the reaction of methane with metal surfaces.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,995</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RheoMan"><Rcn>102287</Rcn><Nid>11086</Nid><HI>Universite Des Sciences Et Technologies De Lille - Lille I, France</HI><Name>MULTISCALE MODELLING OF THE RHEOLOGY OF MANTLE MINERALS</Name><PI>Patrick Cordier</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding mantle convection is essential to understand the thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth and to constrain the forces driving plate tectonics. The rheological properties of the mantle are traditionally inverted from surface geophysical data. Radial profiles of the viscosity are thus available but a lot of uncertainties remain.  A more detailed model of mantle rheology could be obtained from the knowledge of the constitutive flow laws of mantle phases. A lot of progresses have been achieved to extend the P, T range accessible to rheological studies. However, constitutive flow laws are only available so far for minerals from the upper mantle. More severe is the timescale issue since phenomenological flow laws must be extrapolated over several orders of magnitude to be applied to mantle convection.  Recently, a new field has emerged in materials science called multiscale modelling. It allows to link our understanding of a few elementary mechanisms (usually at the microscopic scale) with a behaviour observed at the macroscopic scale. I consider that this offers a ground-breaking opportunity to set a microphysics-based model of the rheology of mantle phases. Much progress has recently been obtained by my group in this direction. A multiscale model of plastic flow consist in modeling: a)	the defects responsible for plastic shear at the atomic scale (dislocations); b)	their mobility under the influence of stress and temperature; c)	their collective behaviour resulting in plastic flow. I propose to build upon those accomplishments and to model the plastic flow of some key phases of the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s mantle: wadsleyite, ringwoodite, MgSiO3 perovskite and post-perovskite to constrain: i)	the viscosity contrast between the transition zone and the lower mantle; ii)	the viscosity profile of the lower mantle (and understand the origin of the peak of viscosity at mid-mantle); iii)	the rheology at the thermal boundary with the core.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,166,407</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RoDyMan"><Rcn>107007</Rcn><Nid>12466</Nid><HI>C.r.e.a.t.e.

This is the main focus of this project that we intend to address from two viewpoints raising new questions in applied mathematics.
Our first research direction is to device robust risk management methods which use the market observations and the no-arbitrage principle. A classical result in financial mathematics essentially states that, in idealized frictionless financial markets, the price processes of tradable securities must be a martingale under some equivalent probability measure. We propose to adopt a conservative viewpoint by deriving the bounds over all possible choices of martingales. By accounting for the rich information corresponding to the prices of European call options, we arrive naturally to a new optimal transportation problem. We intend to analyze several questions: clarify the connection with the Skorohod embedding problem, understand better the duality, develop the corresponding numerical techniques, explore the robust portfolio optimization problems under such constraints, and understand their impact on the risk measurement.
The second direction of research proposed in this project concerns the recent theory of Mean Field Games, recently introduced by Lasry and Lions. Our intention is to address this theory from the probabilistic point of view. The main observation is that the MFG equations, consisting of a coupled system of a Fokker-Planck equation and a semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, can be viewed as an extension of the theory of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE) with mean-field dependence. This theory provides a simple modelling of the interactions which may be used to explain important phenomena on financial markets as the contagion effect and the systemic risk. In particular, the connection with FBSDEs opens the door to probabilistic numerical methods.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,871,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RoMoL"><Rcn>107241</Rcn><Nid>12687</Nid><HI>Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional De Supercomputacion, Spain</HI><Name>Riding on Moore's Law</Name><PI>Mateo Valero Cortes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The most common interpretation of Moore's Law is that the number of components on a chip and accordingly the computer performance doubles every two years. At the end of the 20th century, when clock frequencies stagnated at ~3 GHz, and instruction level parallelism reached the phase of diminishing returns, industry turned towards multiprocessors, and thread level parallelism. However, too much of the technological complexity of multicore architectures is exposed to the programmers, leading to a software development nightmare.
We propose a radically new concept of parallel computer architectures, using a higher level of abstraction, Instead of expressing algorithms as a sequence of instruction, we will group instructions into higher-level tasks that will be automatically managed by the architecture, much in the same way superscalar processors managed instruction level parallelism.
We envision a holistic approach where the parallel architecture is partially implemented as a software runtime, and the reminder in hardware. The hardware gains the freedom to deliver performance at the expense of additional complexity, as long as it provides the required support primitives for the runtime software to hide complexity from the programmer. Moreover, it offers a single solution that could solve most of the problems we encounter in the current approaches: handling parallelism, the memory wall, the power wall, and the reliability wall in a wide range of application domains from mobile up to supercomputers .
We will focus our research on a most efficient form of multicore architecture coupled with vector accelerators for exploiting both thread and data level parallelism.
All together, this novel approach toward future parallel architectures is the way to ensure continued performance improvements, getting us out of the technological mess that computers have turned into, once more riding on Moore's Law.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,356,467</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RobOT"><Rcn>106802</Rcn><Nid>9999</Nid><HI>The University Of Liverpool, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Robust Organic Tectonics</Name><PI>Andrew Ian Cooper</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal will transform the area of organic crystal engineering by introducing a new level of &#226;&#128;&#152;designability&#226;&#128;&#153; into functional molecular crystals. In the last 20 years, extended frameworks, and particularly metal-organic frameworks, have changed the perception of what is possible in terms of purposeful crystal engineering. This is because these frameworks comprise strong and directional extended bonding. By contrast, molecular crystals are not usually dominated by a single, directional motif. It remains highly challenging, therefore, to predict structure in molecular organic crystals, despite their enormous potential for synthetic diversity and function. If crystal structure is not predictable then &#226;&#128;&#152;design&#226;&#128;&#153; of function is impossible. We will develop &#226;&#128;&#152;robust organic tectons&#226;&#128;&#153;&#226;&#128;&#148;that is, organic molecules that assemble in a modular and predictable way without forming intermolecular coordination or covalent bonds.

Our ambitious end goal, which goes beyond the state-of-the-art, is to predict physical properties for organic molecules a priori, based only on chemical formulae, thus guiding the synthetic programme. We will target solids with unprecedented properties&#226;&#128;&#148;for example, chiral porous organic crystals that combine both shape selectivity and site-isolated, &#226;&#128;&#152;orthogonal&#226;&#128;&#153; functionality, inspired by enzymes. To take a longer view, modular and computationally-led engineering of organic crystals could underpin future applications that are conceptual at present, such as molecular computing.

The proposal comprises an integrated blend of chemical synthesis, supramolecular synthesis, characterization (e.g., PXRD), and computation (e.g., crystal structure prediction and molecular dynamics). Overall, we would summarize this as materials chemistry, but underpinned by physical chemistry and computation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,371</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SAEMPL"><Rcn>107666</Rcn><Nid>12880</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Scattering and absorption of electromagnetic waves in particulate media</Name><PI>Karri Olavi Muinonen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The canonical problem of electromagnetic scattering in complex particulate media is solved numerically using multiple-scattering theory based on the Maxwell equations, with an exact treatment of the leading ladder and cyclical interaction diagrams.

The specific research aims of the SAFECON project are: a) development, integration and validation of a next generation of predictive methods based on new mathematical models and efficient computational procedures integrating a new particle-based method, the discrete element method and the finite element method for estimating accurately the dynamics of three dimensional (3D) free surface multiscale heterogeneous flows and their interaction with constructions accounting for FSSI effects. b) Extension and validation of the new particle-discrete-finite element method (PDFEM) for solving 3D FSSI problems allowing for failure mechanisms in the structure and the soil, and c) application of the new computational method (the PDFEM) for predicting the risk of failure in selected civil constructions under the effect of water forces.
The ultimate outputs of SAFECON will be: a) new mathematical models and numerical techniques for analysis of multiscale free surface heterogeneous flows and their interaction with soils and structures and b) new validated computational methods and software for enhanced design and risk assessment of engineering constructions to protect human populations and civil infrastructure in presence of water-induced hazards.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,487,734</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SCAPDE"><Rcn>106581</Rcn><Nid>12871</Nid><HI>Universite De Nice Sophia Antipolis, France</HI><Name>Semi-Classical Analysis and Partial Differential Equations</Name><PI>Gilles Lebeau</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Semi-classical  analysis  started to be developed about 50 years ago by the works of Sato and Hormander on micro-local analysis.
Nowadays, it has reached great achievement with many applications to different topics in analysis including spectral theory, scattering theory, control theory, and some aspects in non linear equations, by the use of dispersive estimates and paraproduct techniques .

The objective of our proposal is to develop new tools and applications in two directions : boundary value problems and connections between probability and semi-classical analysis. We expect to solve  basic remaining open problems in the analysis of boundary problems, and to make  contributions to develop new links between probability and analysis of partial differential equations.

We will focus on four topics :
- 1) Dispersive and Strichartz estimates for wave or Schr&#195;&#182;dinger equations in domains. Applications to the Cauchy problem for non linear waves in domains.
- 2) Theoretical analysis of the optimal control operator in control theory.
- 3) Analysis of  Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm of Metropolis type via PDE's tools.
- 4) Applications of  probabilistic tools to  the analysis of  PDE.

Topics 1) and 2) are strongly connected to progress in the analysis of boundary value problems.
Topic 3) involves a generalization of the classical pseudo-differential calculus. The purpose of topic 4) is to develop a new field of research for deterministic PDE's (and therefore is not in the area of stochastic PDE's).

All topics involve geometric analysis in the phase space."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,705,750</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SDMODELS"><Rcn>94180</Rcn><Nid>11671</Nid><HI>Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Structured Discrete Models as a basis for studies in Geometry, Numerical Analysis, Topology, and Visualization</Name><PI>G&#195;&#188;nter Matthias Ziegler</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Discrete structures appear throughout mathematics not only as approximations to continuous objects, but also as mathematical objects of their own right. The ""right"" discrete models should have analogous theory to the continuous limit, but often more transparent, more interesting structure, it ""tells you more"". The proposed project has the agenda to connect, and make substantial progress in, a number of interesting, but rather diverse instances for this, including
- Convex Polytopes as models for linear, semi-definite and non-linear optimization problems,
- Polyhedral Surfaces as models for differential geometry, including questions of (discrete) integrability,
- Structured meshes as the ""right"" discrete structures for solving systems of partial differential equations with quality guarantees,
- Triangulation models as they appear as models for space in quantum gravity.
In this simultaneous treatment of these topics we hope to capture connections and identify analogous and parallel structures in different parts of mathematics. This is a theory proposal, but a number of the core topics are suggested by applied research, as done e.g. in the framework of the Berlin DFG Research Center MATHEON in Berlin. It will connect to, and rely on, other major structured research groups in Berlin, such as the ""Polyhedral Surfaces"" DFG Research Group, and the Research Training Group led by the PI.

Who is the best doctor to cure insomnia in a nearby hospital? Where can I attend an interesting conference in my field close to a sunny beach?  This information is available on the Web, but no software system can accept such queries nor compute the answer. We hereby propose search computing as the new multi-disciplinary science which will provide the abstractions, foundations, methods, and tools required to answer these and many similar questions. The emerging paradigm of service computing has so far been neutral to the presence of search services, which are equal ""inter pares"". This proposal brings about a simple yet revolutionary idea: service computing evolves into search computing, a new paradigm where ranking is the dominant factor for composing services. While state-of-art search systems answer generic or domain-specific queries, search computing enables answering questions via a constellation of dynamically selected, cooperating search services. The idea is simple, yet pervasive. New foundational theories are needed, rooted into formal disciplines such as mathematics, statistics, and optimization theory. New language and description paradigms are required for expressing queries and for discovering services. New interfaces and protocols help capturing ranking preferences and enabling their refinement. Semantic domain knowledge helps enriching terminological knowledge about objects being searched. Ranking is always relative to individuals and context, thus the study of personal and social behaviour is also essential. Economical and legal implications of search computing must be understood and mastered. In summary, search computing is a multi-disciplinary effort which requires adding to sound software principles contributions from other sciences such as mathematics, operations research, psychology, sociology, knowledge representation, human-computer interfaces, economical and legal sciences."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SEED"><Rcn>106363</Rcn><Nid>10819</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Seizing Electron Energies and Dynamics: a seed for the future</Name><PI>Lucia Anna Reining</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Electronic correlation causes a wide range of interesting phenomena,  such as superconductivity or the fractional quantum hall effect.

In this project we will introduce and establish a completely new method for the calculation of properties of correlated electron systems including ground state total energies, excitation spectra, electron-phonon coupling and non-equilibrium dynamics. The method is based on a non-perturbative solution of a multidimensional functional differential equation. This equation is the SEED from which distinct sub-lines of research will be grown.
Based on my widely recognized experience in the field of many-body physics and starting from recent results of an exploratory study, the project will encircle the problem working on different levels of approximation, each of them introducing new physics. Thus every step along the project will allow us to tackle challenging questions, such as: &#226;&#128;&#156;Does strong coupling in a material lead to new or exotic elementary excitations?&#226;&#128;&#157; or &#226;&#128;&#156;What can we say about multi - exciton generation, and how could it be tuned?&#226;&#128;&#157;.

The question of UV-completion  beyond the Planck length  and  the mysteries of black holes.  It is grounded on a recent program of research where we have put forward a fundamentally different unifying approach  to both of these problems.
This approach is based on modeling Black Holes as self-sustained Bose-Einstein condensates of long wave-length gravitons with the very peculiar property of being stuck at the critical point of a quantum phase transition. This quantum model of black holes is the outcome of understanding the UV-completion of gravity not taking place at the expense of some new dynamics of very short-wavelength degrees of freedom but rather at the expense of long-wavelength collective excitations of the above graviton Bose-Einstein condensate.
Apart of being of undoubted theoretical value for our understanding of black hole physics and its role in the UV-completion,  the new framework has important implications for astrophysics, for LHC searches of micro black holes and for studies of alternative UV-completions of the Standard Model, as well as for making connections between gravity and condensed matter physics, both theoretical and experimental.

Recent years have seen tremendous advances in the development of silicon photonic devices.  However, the last hurdle to full silicon photonic systems and optical data transfer on and between integrated circuits are electrically pumped optical amplifiers and lasers in silicon using a CMOS compatible technology.  Consequently, there have been massive efforts worldwide to search for efficient light emission from silicon.  Our team made a major initial breakthrough producing the first LED in bulk silicon - published in NATURE (1997).  Although a world first, this device only operated efficiently at low temperatures.  This problem was solved using a new nanotechnology - dislocation engineering - reported in NATURE (2001) - and crucially uses only conventional CMOS technology.  The development of this into a silicon injection laser and optical amplifiers is the essential next step for high technology high value applications. We have recently made a further breakthrough by obtaining extraordinary optical gain in erbium doped silicon that now offers a realistic route to this goal. Currently the incorporation of lasers and amplifiers on silicon platforms can only be achieved hybridizations of active devices based on III-V materials ""pasted"" on to silicon waveguides and cavities.  Gain has been reported using four-wave-mixing and Intel has recently demonstrated a Raman laser in silicon but both rely on purely optical-to-optical transitions and are fundamentally unable to be electrically pumped.  We believe we have the only route that has the potential to produce electrically pumped amplifiers and lasers with room and higher temperature operation and that is capable of genuinely being fully integrated into silicon using standard silicon process technology."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,928,021</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SIMCOFE"><Rcn>101615</Rcn><Nid>10451</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Simulating correlated fermions</Name><PI>Matthias Troyer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal concerns simulations for correlated fermionic quantum systems where strong quantum effects give rise to a plethora of fascinating phenomena and new methodological developments are needed for their understanding. Ultracold Fermi gases in optical lattices provide a unique opportunity:  being simpler and more controlled and tuneable than condensed matter material they are not only ideal experimental realizations of correlated fermions but also provide an excellent testing ground for numerical simulation methods. Over the past years we have developed new algorithmic approaches, including continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods for fermionic simulations. These new methods provide performance improvements of many orders of magnitude compared to previous state of the art methods. In this project we will further develop these algorithms and implement them on new massively parallel petaflop supercomputers. This will enable reliable simulations of correlated fermionic quantum systems, such as single and multi-band Hubbard models first in cold atomic gases, and later in realistic models for materials. A second line of research will be the development of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) for ultracold atomic gases. DFT based on density functional for the electron gas is the main workhorse for materials simulation, but it is challenging to apply it to the strongly correlated regime. With a DFT method for atomic gases we will, on the one hand, be able to solve challenging problems in ultracold gases. On the other hand and maybe even more important will be the ability to use cold gases to improve hybrid functionals for the strongly correlated regime. This will form a strong link between ultracold gases and materials science, stronger than the Hubbard model that is the focus of attention at the moment."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,023,980</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SINGLEION"><Rcn>99809</Rcn><Nid>12509</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Spectroscopy and microscopy of single ions in the solid state</Name><PI>Vahid Sandoghdar</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The progress in optical spectroscopy has made it is possible to study individual quantum emitters. However, only a few select &#226;&#128;&#156;bright&#226;&#128;&#157; emitters have been detected so far, leaving a large gap in the choice of critical parameters such as wavelength, coherence time, and energy level schemes. In this project, we develop methods for the detection of single emitters with long fluorescence lifetimes. In particular, we concentrate on rare earth ions embedded in crystals, which are of great technological and fundamental interest. To achieve this goal, we exploit methods from ultrahigh resolution microscopy, laser spectroscopy, scanning probe technology, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and plasmonics.
The first approach to the detection of single ions at cryogenic temperatures will be to perform direct fluorescence excitation as well as absorption spectroscopy to address single Pr3+ ions spectrally within the inhomogeneous line of the sample. Here, we will develop a tunable laser system with sub-kHz linewidth for probing the narrow transitions of the ions.  We expect a signal-to-noise ratio of about 10 in this first step. In order to improve this, we will enhance the emission of ions by pursuing two strategies. In the first case, we shall embed doped crystalline films in monolithic Bragg microcavities. In the second approach, we use plasmonic nanoantennas to reduce the radiative lifetime of the ions in the near field. The well-defined energy levels of ions provide ways for the preparation of long-lived coherent states for use in quantum information processing. Furthermore, access to the homogeneous spectra of ions at different temperatures and doping concentrations will shed light on fundamental open questions regarding their interaction with their matrices.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,925,673</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SIREN"><Rcn>185440</Rcn><Nid>11957</Nid><HI>Budapesti Muszaki Es Gazdasagtudomanyi Egyetem, Hungary</HI><Name>Stability Islands: Performance Revolution in Machining</Name><PI>G&#195;&#161;bor St&#195;&#169;p&#195;&#161;n</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cutting went through a revolution in the 1990s when high-speed milling (HSM) was introduced: the sculpture-like workpieces produced with high precision and efficiency resulted in one order of magnitude less parts in cars/aircrafts, which kept this traditional technology competitive at the turn of the century. This has been followed by an incremental development when not just the cutting speeds, but depths of cut and feed rates are pushed to limits, too.
The limits are where harmful vibrations occur. Cutting is subject to a special one called chatter, which is originated in a time delay: the cutting edge interferes with its own past oscillation recorded on the wavy surface cut of the workpiece. In 1907, the 3rd president of ASME, Taylor wrote: &#226;&#128;&#156;Chatter is the most obscure and delicate of all problems facing the machinist&#226;&#128;&#157;.
In spite of the development of the theory of delay-differential equations and nonlinear dynamics, Taylor&#226;&#128;&#153;s statement remained valid 100 years later when HSM appeared together with a new kind of chatter. The applicant has been among those leading researchers who predicted these phenomena; the experimental/numerical techniques developed in his group are widely used to find parameters, e.g. where milling tools with serrated edges and/or with varying helix angles are advantageous.
The SIREN project aims to find isolated parameter islands with 3-5 times increased cutting efficiency. The work-packages correspond to points of high risk: (1) validated, delay-based nonlinear modelling of the dynamic contact problem between chip and tool; (2) fixation of the tool that is compatible with a dynamically reliable mathematical model of the contact between tool and tool-holder; (3) up-to-date dynamic modelling of the spindle at varying speeds.
High risk originates in the attempt of using distributed delay models, but high gain is expected with robust use of parameter islands where technology reaches a breakthrough in cutting efficiency for the 21st century."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,573,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SISYPHE"><Rcn>94214</Rcn><Nid>11301</Nid><HI>Institut National De Recherche En Informatique Et En Automatique, France</HI><Name>Species Identity and SYmbiosis Formally and Experimentally explored</Name><PI>Marie-France Sagot</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Symbiosis is described as a close relationship between different biological species. It is a pervasive phenomenon, often of a long term nature. It has been estimated that 50% of all known species are parasites, i.e. maintain a symbiotic relation with another species from which they benefit while the partner in the relation is harmed, and that close to a 100% of all plants and animals are parasitised as individuals. Indeed, there are thought to be 10 times more bacterial cells in a human body than human cells. There is growing recognition that symbiosis has a profound impact on the origin and maintenance of the biome and of its ecosystems, on the health of living organisms, and even on sex! Symbiosis thus appears essential to understand some of the most fundamental evolutionary and functional questions related to living organisms. Nevertheless, although symbiotic relationships have been studied by biologists since the early 19th century, they remain little explored by computational biologists. Yet, investigating the enormous variety of such relationships raises formidable mathematical and computational issues. By a highly pluri-disciplinary approach that blends mathematics, algorithmics and wet-lab experiments, we propose to do an intensive, large-scale exploration of the huge variety of genomic and biochemical landscapes observed in the symbiont world, at the interface between symbionts and hosts, and of both with their environment. Our objective is to arrive at a clear view of the importance of symbiosis. This could have far-fetched theoretical and practical implications, notably on our notions of health, our relation with our environment, and our idea of what is species identity, including our idea of what is an individual ."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,333,272</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SIZEFFECTS"><Rcn>102605</Rcn><Nid>10359</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Milano, Italy</HI><Name>Size effects in fracture and plasticity</Name><PI>Stefano Zapperi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding how materials respond to external mechanical perturbation is a central problem of science and engineering. While for most practical purposes it is useful to idealize the mechanical response of a material as a deterministic function of the externally applied perturbation, disorder and fluctuations are unavoidable, leading to sample-to-sample variations and non-trivial size effects. The size dependence of strength is a well known but still unresolved issue in the fracture of materials and structures. The difficulty in addressing this problem stems from the complex interplay between microstructual heterogeneity and long-range elastic interactions. Furthermore, in micro and nanoscale samples, the plastic yield strength displays size effects and strain bursts, features that are not present in macroscopic samples where plasticity is a smooth process. Large fluctuations both in fracture processes and in microscale plasticity make the use of conventional continuum mechanics problematic and calls instead for a statistically based approach.  These problems are becoming particularly important in the current miniaturization trend towards nanoscale devices, since the relative amplitude of fluctuations grows as the sample size is reduced. In this project, concepts and tools of statistical mechanics  are used to address size effects and fluctuations in the irreversible deformation and failure of materials. The general objective is to provide a quantitative theory that can be used as base for setting reliable safety factors. The theory will be based on the renormalization group and will be guided and validated by large scale numerical simulations such as molecular dynamics, discrete dislocation dynamics and disordered network models. Finally, we will analyze experimental data present in the literature.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SMARTGATE"><Rcn>102754</Rcn><Nid>12139</Nid><HI>National Center For Scientific Research "demokritos", Greece</HI><Name>"Smart Gates for the ""Green"" Transistor"</Name><PI>Athanasios Dimoulas</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Ultra-low voltage/power operation is expected to be an important requirement for future nanoelectronics allowing more dense and fast circuits on one hand and enabling the operation of energy efficient intelligent autonomous systems on the other.

This traditional approach has two shortcomings. First, current alloys are not developed via systematic design rules but via empirical methods. This approach is time consuming and inefficient. Second, the increase in strength via traditional hardening mechanisms always causes a dramatic decrease in ductility, i.e., making the material brittle and susceptible to failure.
SMARTMET aims at solving this inverse strength-ductility problem: The joint use of advanced synthesis and atomic characterization (expertise of PI) together with ab initio modeling (expertise of Co-PI) opens a new path to the design of next generation metallic alloys. The objective is to use these methods to identify and utilize strengthening mechanisms that allow to overcome the inverse relationship between strength and ductility. The key idea is to incorporate phases into alloys that are close or beyond their mechanical and thermodynamic stability limit. They undergo transformations under load acting as self-organized repair mechanism. SMARTMET contains risks and gains: (i) Mechanical stability through unstable phases includes the risk of material weakening but it may break the inverse strength-ductility principle. (ii) New metallurgical alloys (PI) designed via quantum mechanics (Co-PI) is risky owing to the complexity of metallic nanostructures but allows alloy tailoring based on first principles."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,920,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SMScom"><Rcn>88806</Rcn><Nid>9854</Nid><HI>Politecnico Di Milano, Italy</HI><Name>Self-Managing Situated Computing</Name><PI>Carlo Ghezzi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>SMScom will develop a consistent, integrated, and homogeneous set of methods and tools for the design, validation, and operation of dependable self-managing situational software, i.e., software that addresses a particular situation, problem, or challenge, and behaves according to the evolving situation in which it operates. Examples of situations are: the type of user (its preferences, its knowledge, ...), the physical environment (the current location of the executing environment), the time at which the application is executed, the device on which it runs, environmental conditions (like temperature, light, ...). We assume that situational changes are frequent, or even continuous, and require adaptation as the application is running and offering a service. This requires the software to be able to self-manage itself via a control loop that propagates the sensed information about situation to changes in the software structure. Several examples of situational applications already exist, and several research directions are already being explored. We argue, however, that at this stage most efforts are ad-hoc, and we miss a coherent global picture. We know how to deal with specific problems, but we lack general methods.  SMScom is a holistic approach to self-managing situational computing. The term  computing  stresses the fact that our work will be rooted into an underlying theory of the field, upon which we wish to develop unified engineering methods and tools to develop dependable self-managing situational software applications. SMScom is a far-looking software engineering research project, which aims at providing a sound and systematic approach to developing practical and useful products. As any far-looking engineering research, it is expected to provide radical innovations. Radical innovations come in two flavors: by pushing some emerging requirements to their extreme and by revisiting through them in a radical manner the way we today develop and operate software.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,544,156</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SNLSID"><Rcn>106611</Rcn><Nid>11891</Nid><HI>Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium</HI><Name>Data Driven Structured Modelling of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems</Name><PI>Joannes Schoukens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Today&#226;&#128;&#153;s state-of-the art methods for system and control design are model based. The ever increasing demand for higher performance and efficiency pushes the systems in a nonlinear operation mode so that nonlinear models are required for their design and control. The model quality and the model building cost are becoming limiting factors for further technological developments.

To close the gap between the designers and the modellers we propose a fundamentally new approach to deliver highly structured nonlinear models meeting the designer&#226;&#128;&#153;s needs. From a theoretical point of view, the major contribution is the development of a new nonlinear structured system identification framework. From practical point of view, the new nonlinear modelling paradigm will become an enabling technology to further push the performance and efficiency of system and control design.

We follow a three step strategy to identify structured nonlinear models:
- A top down approach in which we develop data driven structure revealing methods starting from initial unstructured nonlinear state space models.
- A bottom up approach that identifies complex block oriented models, including parallel and feedback structures starting from the best linear approximation of the nonlinear system. These models are highly structured from the start.
- An new dedicated experiment design strategy will be developed to retrieve the &#226;&#128;&#156;best&#226;&#128;&#157; models with the least experimental cost.

Solving these problems is far beyond the actual abilities of the system identification community.  However, our long standing recognized experience in frequency domain system identification in the presence of nonlinear distortions, and recent work by the PI guarantee the feasibility of the project.

Structured nonlinear model building has applications in traditional industrial and emerging new high technological applications, including biomechanical and biomedical applications."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SOFT HANDS"><Rcn>102189</Rcn><Nid>10411</Nid><HI>Fondazione Istituto Italiano Di Tecnologia, Italy</HI><Name>A Theory of Soft Synergies for a New Generation of Artificial Hands</Name><PI>Antonio Bicchi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Although many advances have been made in the mechatronics and
computational hardware of artificial hands, the state of the art
appears to be only marginally closer to a satisfactory functional
approximation of the human hand than it was twenty years ago. In
my analysis, the main reasons for this are not merely techni-cal,
but invest some fundamental issues in the understanding of the
organization and control of hands, and ultimately the lack of a
theory to guide us in the search for a principled approach to
taming the complexity of hands.  In this project, I propose to
contribute to the development of the fundamental elements of such
a theory, and bring them to fruition in functional engineered
devices. I expect to be able to break through the rather slowly
moving front of the state of the art because of the combination
of two crucial, recent innovations. The first pillar, and the
prime theoretical enabler for this program, is an approach to the
description of the organi-zation of the hand sensorimotor system
in terms of geometric constraints, or synergies: correlations in
redun-dant hand mobility (motor synergies), correlations in
redundant cutaneous and kinaesthetic receptor readings (multi-cue
integration), and overall sensorimotor control
synergies. Elements of such theories have emerged recently in
neurosciences, but their exploitation in the sciences of the
artificial is an enormous potential barely touched upon till
now. The second pillar, providing the new technology needed to
build simpler and more effective artificial hands, is the
understanding of the role of variable impedance actuation in
embodying intelligent grasping and manipulation behaviours in
humans, and the availability of a new generation of &#226;&#128;&#156;robot
muscles&#226;&#128;&#157;, i.e. actuators capable of tuning their impedance to
adapt to the environment and the task. These ideas will be
pursued in close collaboration with specialists in related

The first is the  prediction and analysis of microstructure arising from solid phase transformations in alloys.     Such microstructure largely determines the macroscopic properties of the material, but the prediction of its morphology remains poorly understood, and is related to deep unsolved problems in the calculus of variations. The aim is to make advances in this area using appropriate static and dynamic continuum models of nonlinear elasticity type, thus helping to create a predictive theory.  The second theme is to develop the mathematical theory of  the Landau - de Gennes theory of liquid crystals, in which the distribution of molecular orientations is described by a matrix order parameter. Regarded by physicists as a theory of choice for liquid crystals, the Landau - de Gennes model has been little studied by mathematicians. The aim is to understand more about its validity and properties of solutions, with potential gains for the prediction of the behaviour of new generations of liquid crystal displays.

Linking and underpinning the two themes are common mathematical and conceptual challenges, such as understanding the existence and singularities of minimizers in the multi-dimensional calculus of variations, the approach to equilibrium of thermomechanical systems, and the passage from atomic and molecular to continuum descriptions of materials. An expectation of the project is that  the simultaneous study of problems from the two themes will lead both to new understanding of these fundamental scientific questions  and to beneficial cross-fertilization between the themes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,006,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SOMEF"><Rcn>102200</Rcn><Nid>10702</Nid><HI>National Technical University Of Athens - Ntua, Greece</HI><Name>Critical State Soil Mechanics Revisited: Fabric Effects</Name><PI>Ioannis Dafalias</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The theory of Critical State Soil Mechanics (CSSM) has become a paradigm within the framework of which elastoplastic soil constitutive models have been developed for the last 50 years. The present project will constructively challenge this paradigm from a missing fundamental perspective, namely the effect of soil fabric on the premises of CSSM.

The current CSSM postulates that at critical state the stress and void ratios reach critical values with no reference to orientational aspects of the soil fabric, such as particles long axes, contact normals or void vectors statistical orientations. Thus, several soil mechanical response characteristics associated with fabric anisotropy cannot be adequately or even correctly described within the existing theory. The hypothesis that an evolving soil fabric tensor must also acquire a critical value for critical state to occur will be investigated by theoretical, numerical and experimental means, including continuum and discrete elements methods (DEM) of analysis for cohesive and cohesionless soils, X-ray Computed Tomography studies on real soil samples, and triaxial, biaxial and hollow cylinder experiments. The results of this investigation will be used to propose a new enhanced CSSM theory with fabric playing a distinct role. Particular tasks will include the derivation of an objective rate equation of evolution of the fabric tensor, the formulation of classes of constitutive models for sands and clays within the new fabric-enhanced framework of CSSM, and the Finite Elements analysis of selected geomechanics boundary value problems illustrating the effect of soil fabric by comparing the results with and without fabric effects.

The experiment aims at the clear and unambiguous discovery, or at the definitive disproof, of the so called neutrino anomalies, a set of circumstantial evidences of electron neutrino disappearance at short distance from the source observed by several experiments. The interpretation of the anomalies as oscillations into sterile neutrino components is also supported by cosmological data, which consistently indicate that the total number of neutrinos might be larger than three.
If successful, we will demonstrate the existence of sterile neutrinos, opening a brand new era in fundamental particle physics and in cosmology. A solid signal would mean the discovery of the first particles beyond the Standard Electroweak Model and would have profound implications in our understanding of the Universe.
In case of a negative result, we would close a long standing debate about the reality of the neutrino anomalies, probe the existence of new physics in low energy neutrino interactions, provide a measurement or a limit of neutrino magnetic moment, and give Borexino a superb energy calibration, very beneficial for high-precision solar neutrino measurements.
The experiment will be done by placing a well designed artificial neutrino (or antineutrino) source close or inside the Borexino solar neutrino detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. The superb Borexino sensitivity, its large size, and its very low radioactive background will be the key elements of the experiment.
The expected sensitivity, calculated with high precision Monte Carlo simulations which implements the deep knowledge of the detector response developed by the collaboration and by the P.I. in particular, is sufficient to guarantee either a clear discovery or the complete exclusion of sterile neutrinos as an explanation of the neutrino anomalies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,451,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPARSAM"><Rcn>94089</Rcn><Nid>9896</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Sparse Sampling: Theory, Algorithms and Applications</Name><PI>Martin Vetterli</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Signal representations with Fourier and wavelet bases are central to signal processing and communications. Non-linear approximation methods in such bases are key for problems like denoising, compression and inverse problems. Recently, the idea that signals that are sparse in some domain can be acquired at low sampling density has generated strong interest, under various names like compressed sensing, compressive sampling and sparse sampling. We aim to study the central problem of acquiring continuous-time signals for discrete-time processing and reconstruction using the methods of sparse sampling. Solving this involves developing theory and algorithms for sparse sampling, both in continuous and discrete time. In addition, in order to acquire physical signals, we plan to develop a sampling theory for signals obeying physical laws, like the wave and diffusion equation, and light fields. Together, this will lead to a sparse sampling theory and framework for signal processing and communications, with applications from analog-to-digital conversion to new compression methods, to super-resolution data acquisition and to inverse problems in imaging.

A model imposes a structure on the data, enabling numerous applications. Due to their importance, a considerable research attention has been devoted to the design and use of signal models. Through the past several decades, an evolution of contributions led to a series of constantly improving modeling ideas, and better performance in applications as a consequence. In that respect, the past decade has been certainly the era of sparse and redundant representations, a popular and highly effective model for describing signals.

Despite the huge attractiveness and success that this and other signal models have had so far, this field is still at its infancy, with many unanswered questions and major shortcomings, all pointing to unexplored avenues of future research. The overall objective of this proposal is to bring sparsity-based signal modeling to new frontiers by revolutionizing the way these models are defined and practiced.

More specifically, this proposal outlines several key research directions that will enable us to overcome existing modeling flaws. These include a thorough investigation of the co-sparse analysis model, one of the next fascinating phases of the field of sparse and redundant representations. This new model suggests an alternative rational and has the potential to outperform earlier models. Other directions to be explored in this project are a super-model built as a tree-constellation of sparsity-based models in an attempt to carve better the signal space, a migration from a union-of-subspaces to a union-of-sets, a systematic study of modeling errors in general, and more. The advances that we aim to make will have a marked impact and open the way towards the next generation of signal models and their use in practice."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,269,554</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPDMETALS"><Rcn>98836</Rcn><Nid>13166</Nid><HI>University Of Southampton, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Using Severe Plastic Deformation for the Processing of Bulk Nanostructured Metals</Name><PI>Terence George Langdon</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The processing of metals through the application of severe plastic deformation (SPD) provides an opportunity for achieving exceptional grain refinement to the submicrometer or the nanometer range.  This grain refinement cannot be achieved by conventional methods and it introduces both significant strength and a potential superplastic forming capability.  The two most important SPD techniques are Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) and High-Pressure Torsion (HPT).  In both procedures, very high strains are imposed without introducing any significant changes in the overall dimensions of the samples.  This proposal outlines a research programme based on these techniques.

Although processing by ECAP and HPT has attracted considerable attention, there have been few attempts to make use of this technology for the fabrication of commercial products.  There are several reasons for this omission.  First, both techniques produce materials having high strength but limited ductility.  Second, ECAP is a labour-intensive process that must be adapted to provide a continuous processing capability.  Third, the flow processes are not understood and recent experiments using HPT show remarkable similarities to fluid flow and plasma turbulence.  We will take advantage of the ERC Advanced Grant to investigate these areas with three overall objectives.  First, to provide an understanding of the flow processes and the microstructural evolution occurring in metals when using these techniques.  Second, to develop procedures for the successful utilisation of these techniques in manufacturing.

On the testing side, it is now possible to automatically generate test cases that effectively explore the entire program structure; on the verification side, we can now formally prove properties for software as complex as operating systems. To push validation further, however, we need specifications of what the software actually should do. But writing such specifications has always been hard&#226;&#128;&#148;and so far significantly inhibited the deployment of rigorous development methods.

The SPECMATE methodology automatically extracts such specifications from existing systems, effectively leveraging the knowledge encoded into billions of code lines. SPECMATE starts with just an executable program and automatically produces an incremental specification, starting with the most relevant properties; and a set of test cases fully covering the specification.  Such specifications are ideal starting points for compositional modeling and verification, enabling the rigorous construction and derivation of new, safe, dependable software systems; they also widely automate development activities such as testing, defect detection, and program maintenance.

To achieve these goals, SPECMATE employs a combination of specification mining (extracting specifications from executions), test case generation (generating additional runs to explore execution space) and mutation analysis (seeding synthetic defects to assess test quality).

The traditional point of view assigns exactly equal ground state energies to the enantiomers of chiral molecules. However, with the discovery of parity violation in physics we expect a small &#226;&#128;&#156;parity violating&#226;&#128;&#157; energy difference D, corresponding to an in principle measurable reaction enthalpy. Because D is expected typically in the subfemto eV range these energies were in the past considered to be immeasurably small. Recent theoretical and experimental progress initiated by our group has led to order of magnitude larger predicted values for D and has also made rovibrational line assignment of optical spectra of chiral molecules possible (Quack, Stohner, Willeke, Ann. Revs. Phys. Chem. 2008). Thus the outlook to carry out successful experiments on D is now good, following a scheme previously published by us. The present proposal describes in detail several logical steps for these experiments.
1. Theoretical analysis and high resolution spectroscopy of selected chiral molecules.
2. Quantum tunneling dynamics from spectroscopy to identify appropriate quantum states for the experiment.
3. Preparation of superposition states of otherwise stable R and S enantiomer quantum levels to generate &#226;&#128;&#156;parity isomer&#226;&#128;&#157; states (never before prepared)
4. Spectroscopic observation of the time dependent change of the parity isomer spectra resulting in a first determination of the parity violating D in chiral molecules.
We also discuss the feasibility and the outlook to gain fundamentally new knowledge.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,579,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPEeD"><Rcn>106290</Rcn><Nid>12872</Nid><HI>University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Single Pore Engineering for Membrane Development</Name><PI>Ian Metcalfe</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Mankind needs to innovate to deliver more efficient, environmentally-friendly and increasingly intensified processes.  The development of highly selective, high temperature, inorganic membranes is critical for the introduction of the novel membrane processes that will promote the transition to a low carbon economy and result in cleaner, more efficient and safer chemical conversions.  However, high temperature membranes are difficult to study because of problems associated with sealing and determining the relatively low fluxes that are present in most laboratory systems (fluxes are conventionally determined by gas analysis of the permeate stream). Characterisation is difficult because of complex membrane microstructures.

I will avoid these problems by adopting an entirely new approach to membrane materials selection and kinetic testing through a pioneering study of permeation in single pores of model membranes.  Firstly, model single pore systems will be designed and fabricated; appropriate micro-analytical techniques to follow permeation will be developed.  Secondly, these model systems will be used to screen novel combinations of materials for hybrid membranes and to determine kinetics with a degree of control not previously available in this field.  Thirdly, I will use our improved understanding of membrane kinetics to guide real membrane design and fabrication.  Real membrane performance will be compared to model predictions and I will investigate how the new membranes can impact on process design.

If successful, an entirely new approach to membrane science will be developed and demonstrated.  New membranes will be developed facilitating the adoption of new processes addressing timely challenges such as the production of high purity hydrogen from low-grade reducing gases, carbon dioxide capture and the removal of oxides of nitrogen from oxygen-containing exhaust streams.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,080,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPINMOL"><Rcn>93886</Rcn><Nid>8877</Nid><HI>Universitat De Valencia, Spain</HI><Name>Magnetic Molecules and Hybrid Materials for Molecular Spintronics</Name><PI>Eugenio Coronado</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In this project we intend to design new magnetic molecules and new classes of magnetic molecular materials which, conveniently nanostructured, can be of interest in molecular spintronics, quantum computing and, in general, in nanomagnetism. The project pretends to cover either the development of molecule-based materials with interesting spintronic properties (molecule-based spintronics), as well as the design and study of magnetic molecules of interest in unimolecular spintronics and quantum computing. The objectives will be the following: - Use of molecule-based magnets for the preparation of multilayered spintronic structures (molecular spin valves) - Design of molecule-based magnetic materials exhibiting multifunctional properties (ferromagnetic superconductors, magnetic multilayers and magnetic/conducting multilayers) - Nanopatterning of magnetic nanostructures on surfaces via a molecular approach. - Chemical control of quantum spin dynamics and decoherence in single-molecule magnets based on magnetic polyoxometalates with the aim of developing qu-bits based on these inorganic molecules. - Positioning and addressing magnetic polyoxometalates on surfaces. An unconventional strategy of this project is the use of purely inorganic building blocks, as well as of inorganic magnetic molecules to design these magnetic materials, instead of using metal-organic molecular systems. This purely inorganic molecular building-block approach will benefit from the robustness of this kind of molecules and materials. Another characteristic feature of this project is the combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches for the processing of the molecules / materials.

In the last ten years important progress has been made in the construction of string theory solutions resembling the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics. String compac- tifications giving rise to the gauge group of the SM and three generations of quarks and leptons have been constructed. It has also recently been found that quantized fluxes of the anti-symmetric fields present in the theory  provide for a solution for the long standing problem of moduli stabilization in String Theory.  On the other hand a new era for Particle Physics  has  begun  with the starting into operation of the LHC accelerator in 2010.

The purpose of this project is to make progress in the construction of string semi-realistic solutions and try to obtain information from the LHC data in order to constraint the underlying theory. In order to do that a general study of different classes of string compactifications will be made. If e.g. supersymmetry is found at LHC, we will be able to compare the structure of soft SUSY-breaking soft terms in large classes of string models with experimental data, giving important information about the underlying string theory.

We will address fundamental open questions, create novel quantum-many body systems and seek applications beyond the realm of quantum gases. A two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice is a unique realisation of the Fermi-Hubbard model and it is intimately linked to elementary concepts and open questions in many-body physics. We will develop novel tools for continuous cooling and detection of fermionic atoms in optical lattices. This will enable us to enter the anti-ferromagnetic phase and to study fundamental questions concerning the interplay between localization, coherence and spin-ordering in quantum many-body systems. An intriguing direction towards the creation of novel quantum many-body systems is the coupling of a strongly correlated quantum gas to an optical cavity. Here the cavity creates an effective long-range interaction with global character. This will bring together the physics of strongly-correlated systems and non-linear phenomena using a microscopically accessible system. In this highly explorative field we envisage, as a first experiment, a study of cavity-driven self-organization which may allow us to identify a novel form of a supersolid phase. Rather than investigating or manipulating the quantum gas using light we will also invert this approach and study the light after the interaction with a quantum gas inside a cavity. Using cavity opto-mechanical effects and a van der-Waals blockade by Rydberg atoms excited inside the cavity we will explore squeezing of the light and a novel photon blockade.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SQUTEC"><Rcn>98083</Rcn><Nid>9227</Nid><HI>Universitaet Stuttgart, Germany</HI><Name>Solid State Quantum Technology and Metrology Using Spins</Name><PI>Joerg Wrachtrup</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The development of quantum devices by nanoscopic control of constituents is expected to be one of the largest and most intriguing challenges of modern solid state physics. Among the degrees of freedom which allow exploiting most quantum phenomena are spins. Their long coherence and relaxation times make them of interest to any kind of quantum spin&#226;&#128;&#157;tronics&#226;&#128;&#157; from spin memories to quantum computing and ultrasensitive sensors. In well chosen and engineered environments spin state control and readout can be easy and robust even under ambient conditions. It is the aim of the present proposal to develop complex single spin systems from diamond defects and other dopant/host systems to a degree known hitherto only in atomic physics in terms of controllability and isolation from their environment. These systems should be used to investigate fundamental physical properties, e.g. the quantumness of solid state spins as well as their utilization in sensory devices.
To this end spin defects should be implanted into ultrapure diamond materials with a spatial precision below 10nm. Their relaxation properties should be optimized to the ultimate (spin phonon interaction) limit and individual spin quantum states should be read out in a quantum non demolition-type measurement with highest possible fidelities. This on the one hand will allow the set up of versatile quantum arrays to e.g. study quantum many body physics. On the other hand such structures will yield sensors for magnetic and electric fields with unprecedented sensitivity and scale spatial resolution. Such devices might have revolutionary impact on imaging applications in various fields from materials&#226;&#128;&#153; investigation to bio sciences.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,308,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SSRR"><Rcn>89064</Rcn><Nid>12919</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands</HI><Name>Smart Structured Rotating Reactors</Name><PI>Jacob Cornelis Schouten</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This ERC Grant proposal aims at internationally highly recognized scientific and technological breakthroughs in the understanding, design and operation of Smart Structured Rotating Reactors for the production of high-grade chemicals. Novel reactor types as the multiple spinning disks reactor and the rotating foam reactor will be developed.  The use of smart designs of rotating structured (catalytic) packings in multiphase reactors will be an extremely innovative and exciting new research area in the chemical engineering sciences. It is my firm believe that technologically advanced, compact and highly efficient new reactor types will origin from the approach as outlined in this proposal. The research will also result in original, fundamental knowledge about the interaction of multiphase flows and physical transport processes in these rotating reaction and separation systems.  The quiescent fluid flow in conventional reactors and separators does not permit full control of the transport processes involved. Consequently, product yield, separation efficiency, and energy consumption are not optimal. Conventional equipment is also mostly gravitation force driven, which further limits the operation window. New apparatus incorporate rotating motion which induces high shear in the flow and mimics high gravitation conditions through the centrifugal force. Heat and mass transport are optimally integrated with catalytic activity by using innovative structured (catalyst) packings and smart materials and designs. One example is the proposed rotating chemical plant in which functionalities as compression, mixing, heating, reaction, extraction, and distillation are integrated on interconnected sets of rotating disks.  These new technologies provide highly promising perspectives for future  green  production plants. Chemicals processing will be more flexible using small-sized units and takes place just-in-time and close to the raw materials source or at the location of use.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,833</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STACKSRTFPERIODS"><Rcn>102628</Rcn><Nid>9422</Nid><HI>Tel Aviv University, Israel</HI><Name>Stacks in Representation Theory, Relative Trace Formula and analysis of Automorphic Periods</Name><PI>Joseph Bernstein</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"One of the central problems in number theory is to prove some

These will be hierarchic multilevel bases in the physical domain, either Finite Element wavelet type bases or hierarchical, multilevel bases. In the parameter domains corresponding either to random inputs or to phase spaces in transport problems, spectral type representations of ``polynomial chaos'' type shall be employed. Mathematical aim is to analyzed for a classes of elliptic and parabolic PDEs on high or possibly infinite dimensional parameter spaces adaptive, deterministic and dimension independent solution methods with convergence rates superior to those afforded by Monte Carlo Methods, in terms of accuracy vs. complexity. Algorithmic work will address design of data structures with minimal overhead for the efficient realization of the sparse tensor approximations. Applications include space-time adaptive solvers for elliptic, parabolic and certain parametric hyperbolic PDEs, nonlinear approximate spectral representations of nonstationary random fields, scale-resolving solvers of elliptic and parabolic problems with multiple scales with complexity independent of the number of scales, and sparse, adaptive numerical solvers for parametric transport problems.

Amorphous solids are important in many modern engineering applications, including as important examples structural glasses, metallic glasses and polymeric glasses. Our work combines a careful analysis of  computer simulations of model-glasses with analytic theory in which we introduce to material science methods from statistical and nonlinear physics, both of which are subjects of expertise in our group. We challenge some present approaches that try to connect linear elasticity with some objects that carry plasticity; we claim that nonlinear elasticity is crucial, as its signature appears much before plastic failure. Similarly, we break away from current theories that assume  that  plastic events are spatially localized. We show that in athermal conditions the opposite is true, and we discover  very interesting sub-extensive scaling phenomena characterized by a host of scaling exponents that need to be understood. The peculiarities of amorphous solids, in particular their memory of past deformation, call for the identification of new 'order parameters' that are sorely missing in present theories. Understanding the dependence on system size, temperature, external loading rates etc. calls for introducing new approaches and methods from statistical and nonlinear physics.

Understanding high-redshift star formation is central to many areas of modern astrophysics. However, studying stellar birth in the early Universe is a relatively young field of science, and so still little is known about the origin and observable
characteristics of the first stellar populations. Shedding light on the physical processes that govern
the formation of stars in the early Universe requires a concerted, multi-facetted approach that
combines a range of complementary expertise and innovative techniques. Using novel, high-resolution computer simulations we will (1) identify the physical phenomena that led to the formation of the first and second generations of stars in a systematic and quantitative way, (2) determine their mass distribution, which is the key parameter setting their lifetimes, luminosities, and chemical yields, (3) study the influence of the first stars on their surrounding environment, and (4) by doing so learn more about the subsequent cosmic evolution.

Over the decades since, the questions of what physical processes dominate the star formation process and how the statistical properties of stars are determined have been some of the key questions in astrophysics.  Recently, I have advanced numerical simulations of star formation to the point that, for the first time, we can reproduce a wide range of the observed statistical properties of stars and brown dwarfs.
Here I propose an ambitious project that will make a step change in star formation theory and produce a truly predictive theory of star formation, as opposed to the past state of the field where we have been constantly searching for a mixture of initial conditions and physical processes that can reproduce the stellar properties that we observe.  The project will involve substantial numerical code development, culminating in a fluid dynamical code that incorporates all of the major physical processes thought to influence star formation, including radiative transfer, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, dust, and chemistry.  The scientific outputs will be the determination of how each physical process affects the star formation process, and a wide range of predictions of how stellar properties should vary in different environments and with different initial conditions.  These predictions will give direction to, and be tested by, the next generation of observational surveys of star-forming regions and stellar systems, while at the same time may be employed to improve our understanding of how star formation affects galaxy formation and evolution and how the variation in stellar properties impacts the diversity of planetary systems."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,706,418</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STRATUS"><Rcn>102880</Rcn><Nid>10652</Nid><HI>Politecnico Di Milano, Italy</HI><Name>Structure and dynamics of biomolecules by two-dimensional ultraviolet spectroscopy</Name><PI>Giulio Cerullo</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance is a diagnostic technique that has revolutionized structural biology. A wealth of spectroscopic information can be obtained by extrapolating 2D techniques to the optical frequency domain, using ultrashort light pulses. 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) allows fundamentally new insights into the structure and dynamics of multi-chromophore systems, by measuring how the electronic states of chromophores interact with one another and transfer electronic excitations. Due to technical difficulties, 2DES has been limited so far to the visible range, while most biomolecules absorb in the ultraviolet (UV). This project aims at extending 2DES to the challenging and still uncharted UV-domain and applying it to the study of the photophysics of genomic systems and of the secondary structure of proteins.
Nature has engineered DNA molecules to be photostable, so that harmful photochemical processes are minimized. 2DES will unravel the molecular mechanisms of the photoinduced electronic intra/inter-chromophore events in DNA, exposing the energy dissipation pathways which are responsible for its photoprotection.
2DES will be also established as a new diagnostic tool for structural studies of polypeptides and proteins, relying on the UV absorbing peptide bonds and aromatic residues, the latter acting as native local structural probes. 2DES will provide sensitive information on the misfolding/aggregation processes responsible for a wide class of diseases, with the speed of standard optical techniques but with a much greater information content. This will bridge the experimental gap between crude estimates of protein unfolding and full structure determination, enabling rapid assessment of which variants are worth of deeper structural studies.
To realize the full power of 2DES, experiments will be combined with simulations and electronic calculations that are necessary to correlate the data with molecular states and structures."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STREAM"><Rcn>103379</Rcn><Nid>10617</Nid><HI>Universitaet Bayreuth, Germany</HI><Name>Structural evolution at the nano- and mesoscale</Name><PI>Stephan F&#195;&#182;rster</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal aims to establish a novel type of kinetic experiment by combining microfluidics with micro-x-ray technology to develop a fundamental understanding of nucleation and growth of organic and inorganic nanoparticles, thus aiming to help producing these particles more efficiently in times of constraint materials resources.

These connections are implied by the correspondence between gauge quantum field theory and quantum gravity (the gauge/gravity correspondence ) that is a characteristic feature of string theory, which unifies gravity and Yang-Mills gauge theory in a fundamental manner. There are several interrelated objectives: (1) Strongly coupled non-gravitational systems. The aim is to make use of the gauge/gravity equivalence to further our understanding of particularly interesting matter systems that are intrinsically strongly coupled and for which there are therefore few other calculational tools available. Systems of this type include high energy collisions of heavy ions, systems exhibiting quantum criticality, such as high temperature and heavy fermion superconductors, and quarks confined within hadrons by the strong force. (2) Strongly coupled gravitational systems. The aim here is to make use of the gauge/gravity equivalence to deduce properties of gravitational systems at high curvature, starting from weakly coupled gauge theory. The aim is to study: (a) cosmological singularities and the evolution of the early universe in the big-bang era; {b) quantum properties of black holes. (3) Developing the structure of the gauge/gravity correspondence. The projects outlined above rely on further developing the geometrical structure of string theory.

Solar thermochemical approaches using concentrating solar energy inherently operate at high temperatures and utilize the entire solar spectrum, and as such provide thermodynamic favorable paths to efficient solar fuel production. The targeted solar fuel is syngas: a mixture of mainly H2 and CO that can be further processed to liquid hydrocarbon fuels (e.g. diesel, kerosene), which offer high energy densities and are most convenient for the transportation sector without changes in the current global infrastructure. The strategy for the efficient production of solar syngas from H2O and CO2 involves research on a 2-step thermochemical redox cycle, encompassing: 1st step) the solar-driven endothermic reduction of a metal oxide; and 2nd step) the non-solar exothermic oxidation of the reduced metal oxide with H2O/CO2, yielding syngas together with the initial metal oxide.

Firstly, it focuses on perturbative and non-perturbative sources of Supersymmetry Breaking in the low-energy effective Supergravity description of Superstrings and M-theory. These include Gaugings and Fluxes in compactifications from higher dimensions, Gaugino Condensation and other non-perturbative effects generated by (unoriented) D-brane instantons. Secondly, it explores the physics of extremal  Black Holes by means of the Attractor Mechanism, that relates their Entropy to the extrema of an Effective Potential. The tantalizing analogy with moduli stabilization in flux compactifications is considered in detail. Moreover, the deep connection between the Entropy-Formula and certain topological string partition functions is exploited to improve the connection between macroscopic and microscopic interpretations. The holographic (AdS/CFT) correspondence conjectured by Maldacena between (super)conformal Yang-Mills theories and certain (super)gravity theories in Anti De Sitter spaces is analyzed in view of the attractive nature of universal horizon geometries and in relation to Higher-Spin Symmetries, that may be associated with bulk duals of certain gauge-invariant composite operators on the boundary. The project also addresses the possible link between higher-spin theories and an unbroken phase of Superstring or M-theory. The project will be carried out through the abilities and the skills of the PI and of the team members, with their complementary expertise on different but interrelated topics in the holographic approach to modern theories of quantum gravity.

The existence of anomalies in the rotational inertia of solid helium around 100 mK has been confirmed. They are accompanied by a peak in the specific heat and by astonishing anomalies in the elastic properties. It is now generally accepted that supersolidity is due to the presence of disorder in the samples: dislocations, grain boundaries, helium 3 impurities &amp;However, in our opinion, nobody understands how which kind of disorder is responsible for the observed supersolidity.

We know how to prepare either polycrystals , disordered single crystals or very high quality single crystals. We propose to study the elastic properties and the rotational inertia of solid samples with known disorder. In most previous experiments one had to guess what was the crystal quality. With dc-flow experiments and ion mobility measurements, we also propose to investigate the predicted superfluidity of grain boundaries and dislocation networks.

During the past five years there has been increasing evidence that proximity coupling between singlet superconductors and ferromagnets can sometimes generate triplet pairs within the ferromagnet - the evidence being that supercurrents can be passed through ferromagnetic materials over length scales which are simply too large for singlet pairs to survive. Earlier this year, in parallel with two other international groups, we made a breakthrough in demonstrating how this triplet state can be created in a controlled way. Together, the results have opened the way for a rich new field of triplet superconductivity in which the potential ability of a supercurrent to carry spin can be allied with standard spin electronics (""spintronics"").

In this project we will  build on our lead in this field and to explore how triplet currents can be controlled by magnetic elements within a device so that the spin supercurrent can be directly measured. As well as demonstrating superconducting spintronic devices, this project also aims to investigate the potential of creating artificial p-wave superconductors by exploiting materials which are predicted to have a favourable p-wave coupling but which are not themselves superconductors.

Together, these features define a Constitutional Dynamic Chemistry (CDC) at both molecular and supramolecular levels. CDC takes advantage of constitutional dynamics to allow variation and selection, so as to achieve adaptation.
The overall objective of the present proposal is to further explore the scope of CDC through:
1) establishment of novel reversible covalent reactions, (in particular the synthetically important Diels-Alder and C=C bond forming reactions) without or with catalysis, and the physicochemical studies of the CDC processes;
2) investigation of the modulation of dynamic libraries by either physical stimuli or chemical effectors and their adaptation to these sollicitations;
3) development of constitutional dynamic materials, of either technological or biological interest, in particular dynamic polymers such as dynamic polyamides and dynamic biomolecules;
4) elaboration of multiple dynamic systems, combining dynamic processes of different types, and their implementation in allosterically switchable synthetic reactions and in dynamic information processing devices.
CDC represents a paradigm shift with respect to constitutionally static chemistry. In the process of reaching higher levels of complexity, it gives access to the generation of constitutional dynamic networks of interconverting constituents, that provide an approach to the chemistry of adaptive and evolutive systems."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,842,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SUPRAIMAGINGMACHINES"><Rcn>98150</Rcn><Nid>9404</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Ditopic Imaging Agents, Interlocked Sensors and Machines"</Name><PI>Paul Derek Beer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The development of new innovative approaches for personalised healthcare, and the recognition and sensing of environmentally important pollutants resulting from anthropogenic activities, are extremely important areas in which chemical understanding can contribute enormously to the improved well-being of humanity. In particular, the recognition of anions in aqueous media remains a significant challenge. This project will exploit cation-anion interactions augmented by supramolecular chemistry in the preparation of novel heteroditopic receptor molecules for lanthanide cation- anion ion pair recognition. These have the potential to revolutionise magnetic resonance imaging for personalised healthcare, and will provide interlocked host systems capable of sensing and analyte induced molecular motion. Particular emphasis will be given to the construction of heteroditopic macrocyclic and interlocked host systems designed to recognise lanthanide cation-fluoride anion ion pairs. The stimulus for recognising the fluoride anion stems from its duplicitous nature, where for example high levels in drinking water is causing dental and skeletal fluorosis. In stark contrast, importantly for personalised healthcare, fluoride anion recognition offers the potential development of novel 19F MRI and 18-fluoride PET imaging agents. The programme of work in this proposal centres around three closely integrated and synergistic strands. The common theme is to exploit lanthanide- fluoride ion pair recognition in multimodal imaging (Strand 1), to construct interlocked host structures for fluoride recognition, sensing and molecular machine-like induced switchable behaviour (Strand 2), and to assemble interlocked host systems onto transducing surfaces for analyte induced molecular switching (Strand 3)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,488,849</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SUPRANANO"><Rcn>97609</Rcn><Nid>12111</Nid><HI>Universite Pierre Et Marie Curie - Paris 6, France</HI><Name>From metal nanocrystal to supracrystal: crystallinity at nanometer and micrometer scales</Name><PI>Marie-Paule Pileni</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The Applicant has an outstanding record of achievement and an international reputation for independent research in many areas of physical chemistry and more specifically over the last 25 years in nanosciences. This large expertise makes it possible, through this project, to come to a decisive turning point in her career. This high-impact and challenging proposal brings together innovative ideas in nanomaterials within a single inter- and multi-disciplinary project to open up new horizons across materials science. The challenging and innovating issue of this project consists in authenticating and detailing the emergence of new chemical and physical properties directly related to the ordering of atoms in nanocrystals (nanocrystallinity) and the ordering of nanocrystals in supracrystals (supracrystallinity). Au, Ag, and Co nanocrystals with different nanocrystallinities (single domain, multiply-twinned and polycrystalline particles) will be synthesized by new methods. Nanocrystals will be used to produce supracrystals of these metals with different supracrystallinities (fcc, hcp, or bcc). The influence of nanocrystallinity on the diffusivity of different atoms within Ag and Co nanocrystals will be investigated. Physical properties of both nanocrystals and supracrystals such as the vibrational, electronic and mechanical properties and their dependence on crystallinity will be explored. From the data thus obtained it should be possible to point out analogies between the properties of atoms in nanocrystals or in the bulk phase and those of nanocrystals ordered in supracrystals. Moreover, correlations between the studied properties could emerge.

This proposal intends to exploit this fact to make significant progress on three important topics in theoretical physics, namely, black holes, strongly-coupled gauge fields, and instantons and supersymmetry breaking. Besides supersymmetry, there is a variety of cross-links between these topics, as well as joint applications. The specific objectives of the proposal are as follows. The first objective concerns the determination of supersymmetric black hole entropy for finite electric and magnetic charges, improving our understanding of critical aspects of the field-theoretic description of the entropy, in direct confrontation with the results based on the counting of microscopic states. The second objective is a construction of the exact spectrum of quantum strings moving in an anti-de Sitter space-time, which, according to the gauge-string correspondence, yields the spectrum of a corresponding dual supersymmetric gauge theory. Deforming the anti-de Sitter space will then lead to stringy descriptions of non-perturbative phenomena in a generic gauge theory with a confining phase. The third objective pertains to instantons and their implications for phenomenologically viable string compactifications on spaces with generalized geometries, which include background electric and magnetic fields. An instanton calculus will be developed to improve the understanding of non-perturbative string theory and its implication for moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breaking."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,910,093</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SWITCH2STICK"><Rcn>111001</Rcn><Nid>12448</Nid><HI>Leibniz-Institut Fuer Neue Materialien Gemeinnuetzige Gmbh, Germany</HI><Name>Engineering of biomimetic surfaces: Switchable micropatterns for controlled adhesion and touch</Name><PI>Eduard Arzt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Nature has, in the course of evolution, found many fascinating solutions to &#226;&#128;&#156;engineering problems&#226;&#128;&#157;.

However, current visualization techniques can give only little or no guarantees regarding the confidence in the displayed information. Since this information is always affected by uncertainties in the data generation and visualization processes, the user can be lead to misclassifications, misinterpretations, and false assumptions.
This proposal challenges the status quo in visual data analysis with innovative ideas for next-generation technology that provides uncertainty visualization as a core methodology. We will develop a visual language for the communication of the variability of features due to uncertainties in the data generation and visualization processes. Our research aims at modeling the uncertainty stochastically and deriving probability distributions for the occurrence of features. Especially in 3D, finding meaningful visualizations of the effect of uncertainty is extremely demanding and requires going far beyond existing approaches.
Besides radically changing the way visual data exploration is performed, our research has the potential to strongly influence the way scientific measurements and computer simulations are carried out. The precise knowledge of uncertainties enables to discover quantitatively the data generation process, and it can, therefore, be used to quantify the sensitivity of a process and the generated results to the choice of parameterization over the input parameters. Hence, it is our second vision to position uncertainty visualization as a future technology for guiding research towards the most reliable data generation process within a given uncertainty tolerance.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,296,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SciFri"><Rcn>99533</Rcn><Nid>11841</Nid><HI>Stichting Voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek Der Materie - Fom, Netherlands</HI><Name>Science Friction</Name><PI>Joost Wilhelmus Maria Frenken</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"There is no fundamental law that dictates the necessity of losing energy in a sliding contact.

But, in almost all cases, they have failed to provide acceptable descriptions of complex porous media. In petroleum engineering, we are not able to predict the true reservoir behaviour; our predictions must be continuously revised through &#226;&#128;&#156;history matching&#226;&#128;&#157;. In soil physics, we find that persistent pesticides do reach deep groundwater resources contrary to our model predictions. Almost all models fail to predict the outcome of soil and groundwater remediation operations. Predictions of performance of industrial systems such as fuel cells and fluid absorbents are poor at the best. We are confronted with major challenges related to the prediction of performance and safety of subsurface CO2 sequestration, and questions related to threats and opportunities associated with methane gas hydrates under the oceans. One major shortcoming of our porous media models is the lack of consideration for the fact that fluids can fill up the pores in many different configurations, even for the same degree of fluid saturations. Each configuration results in different rates of fluids flow and in different mass and heat transport behaviours. Another major defect is the fact that our current models apply to continuous phases. But, in many applications, we have discontinuous fluid phases. The general aim of the proposed research is to establish a new paradigm for modelling flow and transport in porous media. We shall perform integrated experimental and computational research in order to establish advanced physically-based theories for description of porous media processes. We shall construct a host of micromodels for physical experiments on flow and transport and perform sandbox experiments on multiphase flow to study processes that occur in gas hydrates and fuel cells.

However, owing to the incomplete state of scientific knowledge, there is a large range of uncertainty in the predictions, of a factor of more than two for any given emissions scenario during the 21st century, and much larger for subsequent centuries. This is a serious obstacle to the assessment of impacts. Sea-level change is a diagnostic of a complex combination of Earth system processes operating over a wide range of timescales. Explaining the record of past sea-level change and predicting the future is therefore a fascinating interdisciplinary scientific challenge as well as one with practical implications. The aim of this project is to improve quantitative understanding and hence reduce uncertainty in predictive models of the two main climate-related contributions to sea-level change, namely ocean density change and changes in ice-sheets. The former is the most important term on timescales of years to centuries, and the latter is the principal influence over timescales of centuries to millennia. In both parts of the proposal, our focus is on analysis of changes simulated by 3D atmosphere-ocean climate models, which we compare with observational data. For ocean density change, the objectives are to analyse the physical processes responsible for global-mean and local sea-level change due to density change, in order to quantify and constrain the uncertainties in predictions. For ice-sheets, the objectives are to increase our understanding of and ability to model the coupled evolution of ice-sheets and climate on multi-millennial timescales, in particular regarding the last glacial cycle and the long-term future of the Greenland ice-sheet.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,441,719</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SeismoSun"><Rcn>106168</Rcn><Nid>12179</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Magnetohydrodynamic Wave Diagnostics of the Solar Atmosphere in the Era of Transformative High-Resolution Observations</Name><PI>Valeri Nakariakov</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Funding is sought for a 5-year project supporting two postdoctoral research assistants and two 4-year PhD studentships to carry out a research programme on qualitative advances of our understanding of basic physical processes operating in the atmosphere of the Sun.

From a biophysical point of view, this dynamic structure formation and stabilization stems from a self-organisation process that is tightly controlled by the simultaneous and competing function of a plethora of actin binding proteins (ABPs). The ABPs can be classified to regulate (1) the polymerisation and depolymerisation kinetics of the individual filaments, (2) the structure of the network by crosslinking and bundling the filaments and (3) the dynamic reorganisation and contraction mediated by molecular motors.
The major goal is to obtain a sound physical understanding of cellular self organizing principles, by successively increase the complexity of the experimental system in a bottom up approach. Three work packages are defined: (i) the microscopic mechanism of the interaction of ABPs with actin filaments on the treadmilling behaviour of actin. (ii) the effect of confinement, hydrodynamic flow and crosslinking proteins in a 2D high density motility assay and (iii) developing a reconstituted 3D active gel composed of actin filaments and crosslinking molecules. To this end, we will introduce and combine established and new biophysical and biochemical methods and interdisciplinary approaches, with a major emphasis on quantitative imaging and analysis techniques.

Single fluorescent molecules can now be located and tracked with a spatial resolution as high as a few tens of nanometers, even at depths as large as several microns. These capabilities are ideal to link the macroscopic physical properties of soft condensed matter with the structure, organization and dynamics of the constituent molecules. Perhaps the most surprising conclusion drawn from single-molecule observations is the unsuspected heterogeneity of molecular assemblies, both in time and space, which had remained largely hidden in conventional ensemble experiments. The structural glass transition is said to be one of the hardest open problems in condensed matter science. Although most agree on the crucial part played by heterogeneity in this process, the guesses vary wildly as to the scale and relaxation times of the inhomogeneities. Our recent discovery of glassy rheology in supercooled glass formers, following earlier observations of heterogeneity, has been received with much interest in the complex liquids community. I am convinced that single-molecule studies have the potential to radically change our view of supercooled liquids and glasses. In a broader sense, molecular insight from chemical physics complements the general ideas developed by statistical physicists. I believe it is the missing link toward a molecular control of the physical properties of soft materials. I propose to perform a broad range of novel single-molecule experiments using a micro-rheological cell to apply mechanical stress, strains and/or temperature jumps. In particular, we will perform mechanical studies of solid-solid friction, and temperature-jump studies of single proteins and single protein complexes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,836,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Socathes"><Rcn>89099</Rcn><Nid>9600</Nid><HI>Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Germany</HI><Name>Solid State/Cold Atom Hybrid Quantum Devices</Name><PI>Reinhold Kleiner</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Solid state physics and atomic physics have developed in a way that the combination of the two fields will produce massive synergetic effects and new physics. Thin film structures can be patterned and controlled down to the atomic level. Mesoscopic structures are used to create well defined two level systems and are presently explored in terms of their capability of being the basis of a quantum computer. The quantum dynamics of single electrons on a quantum dot or single Cooper pairs or flux quanta in case of superconductors can be controlled very well at temperatures in the Millikelvin range. Complementary, atomic physics has learned to control atoms and molecules almost perfectly and has turned to large ensembles of cold atoms forming e. g. Bose Einstein Condensates at low temperatures. In the present proposal we aim on the realization of such coupled solid state - atomic objects, starting with superconducting structures on the solid state side and with Rubidium atoms on the quantum optics side. We plan to investigate their fundamental properties and explore possible applications. In a second stage we consider including mechanical systems - nanoresonators - into our investigations. The heart of the experiments will be a ultra high vacuum millikelvin environment realized by a properly designed 3He-4He dilution refrigerator combined with a cold atom/BEC system. In terms of fundamental physics we will investigate the quantum nature of systems consisting of a macroscopic object like a flux quantum coherently coupled to a microscopic object like an atom. Combining solid state devices with atoms could lead to novel architectures in the field of quantum devices. In a similar spirit, ultrasensitive solid state detectors could be combined with atomic detection schemes, allowing for novel high precision measurement systems.

Three core objectives going far beyond the state of the art are tackled: in conformable electronics stretchable ferroelectrets and rechargeable batteries promise novel electronic items. The groundbreaking approach of this proposal is the development of stand-alone stretchable electronic items including sensing capabilities for touch and other environmental stimuli, information distribution, as well as power generation and distribution. Such devices can be used in soft robots, artificial limbs and morph designs. The second objective on soft machines addresses electromechanical instabilities in soft transducers, leading to giant stroke actuators, enabling programmable Braille readers and tactile feedback in consumer electronics. Stretchable nonlinear optical materials allow for efficient phase-matched operation, opening new research fronts in adaptive photonics. The third objective on renewable energy concerns mechanical energy scavenging from environmental sources. We focus on water as electrode in deformable capacitors and as gap filling dielectric in variable capacitors. Efficient operation cycles maximizing energy of conversion are developed. The wide range of objectives, but also the possible applications require expertise in thermodynamics of soft matter, in electrical and mechanical engineering and in device implementation.

The complexity is attributed to soil ecological heterogeneity reflecting interplay of spatio-temporal, physical, and nutritional variables delineating spheres of influence that define microbial habitats and function. Key to microbial life in soil is a flickering aqueous network that defines nutrient diffusional pathways and shapes microbial dispersion and interactions. We propose to develop an individual-based and spatially resolved modeling platform that explicitly considers soil pore structure and aqueous phase configuration and associated biophysical processes forming a virtual soil microcosm. The assembly of these complex ingredients into a computational platform will enable systematic hypotheses testing concerning central questions in microbial ecology that are neither addressed by present ecological theories nor emerge from standard continuum models. Specifically, the project will provide quantitative insights into effects of hydration extremes on survival strategies, the roles of space and diffusional heterogeneity, aspects of dispersion and trophic interactions, self-organization of consortia, and emergence of temporal niches in soil. The research will transform quantitative understanding of soil biophysical processes, a gap that presently limits coherent interpretation of the rapidly growing molecular-based estimates of soil biodiversity, and is essential for guiding future data collection.

The progress of quantum cascade technologies now offers a new device platform where to explore concepts for the reciprocal manipulation of light and vibrations with unprecedented possibilities. The accessible THz spectrum is in fact particularly intriguing. The wavevector of the electromagnetic field can be tuned to that of the vibration, be it a phonon or the oscillating mode of a macroscopic object, enhancing selectivity and strength of the interaction. The low radiation frequency then makes it technically feasible to optically couple mechanical elements at distances much smaller than the wavelength, allowing, for instance, to exploit optical forces between surface plasmon modes atop metallic membranes. Lastly, it is foreseeable  to include mechanical oscillators within the laser cavities, thereby creating new laser dynamics driven by the radiation pressure, and developing opto-mechanical effects in an active device where they can be studied, and eventually controlled, through the laser emission.
SouL Man aims at establishing the field of THz opto-mechanics, relying on quantum cascade lasers for investigating phenomena and concepts available in this spectral range and in optically active systems, as wells as at using this knowledge to implement innovative device functionalities and applications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,180,306</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="StochExtHomog"><Rcn>107668</Rcn><Nid>12834</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Stochasticity in Spatially Extended Deterministic Systems and via Homogenization of Deterministic Fast-Slow Systems</Name><PI>Ian Melbourne</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Ergodic theory is the analysis of probabilistic or statistical aspects of deterministic systems.   Roughly speaking, deterministic systems are those that evolve without any randomness.   Nevertheless, the probabilistic approach is appropriate since specific trajectories are unpredictable in &#226;&#128;&#156;chaotic&#226;&#128;&#157; systems.  At the other extreme, stochastic systems evolve in a random manner by assumption.

One of the main topics of this proposal is to investigate how separation of time scales can cause a fast-slow deterministic system to converge to a stochastic differential equation (SDE).   This is called homogenization; the fast variables are averaged out and the limiting SDE is generally of much lower dimension than the original system.   The focus is mainly on situations where the SDE limit is driven by Brownian motion, but SDEs driven by stable L&#195;&#169;vy processes are also of interest.   Homogenization is reasonably well-understood when the underlying fast-slow system is itself stochastic.  However there are very few results for deterministic fast-slow systems.   The aim is to make homogenization rigorous in a very general setting, and as a byproduct to determine how the stochastic integrals in the SDE are to be interpreted.

A second main topic is to explore the idea that anomalous diffusion in the form of a superdiffusive L&#195;&#169;vy process arises naturally in odd dimensions but not in even dimensions.   The context is pattern formation in spatially extended systems with Euclidean symmetry, and this dichotomy can be seen as an extension of the classical Huygens principle that sound waves propagate in odd but not even dimensions.  For anisotropic systems (where there are translation symmetries only), the situation is simpler: chaotic dynamics leads to Brownian motion and weakly chaotic dynamics (of intermittent type) leads to a L&#195;&#169;vy process.  However in the isotropic case (rotations and translations), anomalous diffusion is suppressed in even dimensions in favour of Brownian motion.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,577,880</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Strings&amp;Gravity"><Rcn>105985</Rcn><Nid>10922</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Fundamental Aspects of Strings and Gravity</Name><PI>Dieter L&#195;&#188;st</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The proposed ERC Advanced Grant &#226;&#128;&#156;Strings&amp;Gravity&#226;&#128;&#157; is centered around string theory as a consistent theory of quantum gravity in the context of particle physics and cosmology. We are addressing several ground breaking and highly innovative questions about the structure of space and time and the nature of fundamental interactions at very short distances. In particular we are planning to investigate various new aspects concerning the fundamental relation between string theory and gravity. These contain the intriguing properties of string scattering amplitudes and its so far not understood relations to the new concept of classicalization as well as the relation between black hole production and the production of heavy string Regge excitations. This part of the project will be also relevant for the search of extra dimensions and for mini black holes at the LHC. Furthermore we are planning to investigate stringy background geometries, which generalize the concept of Riemannian manifolds. We are aiming to get new insights from string theory and from non-geometric string backgrounds into the problem of dark energy, which is one of the most mysterious parts of Einstein relativity in relation to Standard cosmology.
This part of the project will be related to derive possible inflationary scenarios from new non-geometric compactifications without and with D-branes and background fluxes. The final aim of string theory will be to understand if the quantum structure of gravity and of space and time can emerge from an underlying and so far unknown dynamical principle, a problem which is equally important for the understanding of the Big Bang as for the physics of Black Holes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>959,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SuPro"><Rcn>110621</Rcn><Nid>11462</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Superamphiphobic surfaces for chemical processing</Name><PI>Hans-J&#195;&#188;rgen Butt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Superhydrophobic surfaces hold enormous promise as future self-cleaning or anti-fouling coatings. Their widespread use was, however, limited by contamination with oils and dissolved substances and insufficient mechanical stability. Superamphiphobic surfaces prevent contamination. They not only repel water but also non-polar liquids, surfactant and protein solutions. We recently developed a concept to fabricate transparent, robust superamphiphobic coatings, that is potentially upscalable for industrial mass production. The almost contact-free interface will open up new opportunities in membrane technology, solvent-free production of microspheres, in microfluidics, and in preventing biofilm formation. With targeted experiments and simulation we relate the microscopic structure of superamphiphobic layers to their impalement pressure, roll-off angle, mechanical strength and hydrodynamic drag. Based on these insight, improved and adapted designs will be developed. This project will make it possible to determine the potential of superamphiphobic layers in novel approaches to microchemical processing including improved transport, synthesis and characterization.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SuperQuNet"><Rcn>110814</Rcn><Nid>10171</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Superconducting Quantum Networks</Name><PI>Andreas Joachim Wallraff</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Today superconducting electronic circuits are one of the prime physical systems to explore both foundations and technological applications of quantum mechanics.The concept of processing information more efficiently using quantum mechanics has stimulated enormous progress in control and measurement of quantum electronic circuits. Now such circuits are one of the prime contenders for realizing a viable quantum information processor. Similarly, the realization of strong coherent interactions between superconducting quantum bits and individual photons has stimulated a wide range of research exploring quantum optics in these systems. In this project we plan to investigate quantum communication using superconducting circuits, an area altogether unexplored in this domain. For this purpose we will develop both hardware and experimental techniques to realize superconducting quantum networks across distances of tens of meters. In contrast to existing experiments in which quantum information is distributed over millimeter distances only, realizing such networks will allow us to address both fundamental and practical questions. In particular, we will create and test networking architectures for superconducting quantum information processors, we will create entanglement over distances on meter length-scales and perform Bell-tests of space-like separated objects with high detection efficiency. We also plan to realize and test elements for quantum repeaters and  to explore ideas of blind quantum computation. The remarkable progress in quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits, including more than 5 orders of magnitude improvement in coherence over the last 13 years, contributes to the great potential of these systems for applications.

field of mathematics which originally appeared as a geometric tool for problems of classical mechanics. Since the 1980ies, new powerful methods such as theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves, Morse-Floer theory on loop spaces, symplectic field theory and mirror symmetry changed the face of the field and put it at the crossroads of several mathematical disciplines. In this proposal I develop function theory on symplectic manifolds, a recently emerged subject providing new tools and an alternative intuition in the field. With these tools, I explore footprints of symplectic rigidity in quantum mechanics, a brand new playground for applications of ``hard"" symplectic methods. This enterprise  should bring novel insights into both fields. Other proposed applications  of function theory on symplectic manifolds include Hamiltonian dynamics and Lagrangian knots. Function theory on symplectic manifolds is fruitfully interacting with geometry and algebra of groups of symplectic and contact transformations, which form another objective of this proposal.  I focus on distortion of cyclic subgroups, quasi-morphisms and restrictions on finitely generated subgroups including the symplectic and contact versions of the Zimmer program. In the contact case, this subject is making nowadays its very first steps and is essentially unexplored. The progress in this direction will shed new light on the structure of these transformation groups playing a fundamental role in geometry, topology and dynamics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,787,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SysTEAM"><Rcn>94254</Rcn><Nid>9831</Nid><HI>Uppsala Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Systems and Signals Tools for Estimation and Analysis of Mathematical Models in Endocrinology and Neurology</Name><PI>Peter Stoica</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal envisages a research program in the field of systems and signals that will lead to innovative and agile mathematical modeling as well as model-based signal processing and control tools for applications in biology and medicine.

The scientific objectives are: (1) Determine the trajectory of change in remaining tropical forests, (2) Unravel the drivers of change, (3) Gauge the sensitivity of forests to the climate change threat, and (4) Scale the findings to the present and future earth system.

The 5-yr interdisciplinary research project led by Oliver Phillips will construct a Pan-Tropical Observatory of Forest Function, using this to reveal the transient and long-term forest response to global change. In Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America, T-FORCES will direct long-term on-the-ground observations of forest dynamics, and integrate them with complementary approaches including high frequency measurement of the climate-sensitivities of different components of the carbon cycle, and full analysis of forest climate, landscape, and ecology. The huge scale of the tropical forest biome will be used to develop a series of natural experiments:
*Within continents, gradients of climate, soil, and disturbance will be sampled to explore current, transient responses and to scale-up in space and time.
*Six elevational gradients will provide replicates to reveal the equilibrium sensitivities of tropical carbon cycle processes to temperature.
*By working across four tropical continents each provides independent tests to distinguish between change drivers that may be regional (eg Amazon drought) or global (eg CO2 fertilisation) in nature.

T-FORCES will transform scientific understanding of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle, by revealing the key patterns, impacts and processes so far, the threat to forests from global change, and the risk that forests will magnify those changes. The Pan-Tropical Observatory of Forest Function will provide the global science community with the baseline and framework to investigate the processes involved throughout our century.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TADMICAMT"><Rcn>185427</Rcn><Nid>10751</Nid><HI>Universitaet Bayreuth, Germany</HI><Name>"Topological, Algebraic, Differential Methods in Classification and Moduli Theory"</Name><PI>Fabrizio Catanese</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Moduli of curves with symmetries:determine the stable irreducible components of the moduli space of curves of  genus g with an action of a finite group G, using a new homological invariant.

The research is interdisciplinary since it is connected to statistical methods as well as to High Energy Physics. The techniques developed will also be used for many other projects, including the ongoing Hubble Space Telescope CLASH survey of clusters and the planned ESA Euclid space mission.

Short-lived (~1 ms) and very energetic photon emissions (&gt;1 MeV and later: &gt;40 MeV) were found to originate from the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s atmosphere and were named Terrestrial Gamma Flashes (TGFs). These flashes are the most energetic natural photon phenomenon that is known to exist on Earth, in which also anti-matter is produced. Based on the few datasets available to date we believe that TGFs are related to electric discharges in thunderstorm systems and that electrons accelerated to relativistic energies are involved to produce bremsstrahlung of such high energies. However, it is not known how frequent TGFs are, the altitude range and the spatial extent of their source region, to what kind of thunderstorms and lightning they are related or the implications of relativistic electrons and positrons ejected into space. There is no consensus on how TGFs are produced. All these questions need to be answered before we understand how important they are and how they may affect the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s electrical circuit and atmosphere.

The goal of the TGF-MEPPA project is to attack these questions by combining modelling of electron acceleration in thunderstorm electric fields, X- and gamma-ray production and propagation, lightning development with unprecedented measurements of TGFs from three different altitudes: 350 km, 30 km  and 20 km to obtain the most comprehensive and detailed dataset needed to make significant advances in the TGF research.

My proposed research will focus on three inter-related paleoclimatic themes, applied to the very warm climates of the Early Eocene, one of the most fascinating intervals in Earth history. First, I will generate new records of continental temperature using bacterial membrane lipid based proxies that have been recalibrated and critically evaluated for wetland environments. Second, I will assess how the global hydrological cycle responded to both transient and long-term warmth, including evaluating precipitation change and its impact on erosional and weathering regimes; this will entail the development of compound-specific hydrogen isotopic tools in modern contexts, doubling the number of such deep time records, and interpreting those data in the context of isotope-enabled climate models.  Third, I will generate the first Paleogene records of terrestrial methane cycling using lipids derived from methanotrophs and methanogens, calibrated in modern settings and applied to Eocene lignites.  These objectives are intrinsically linked via the feedbacks between pCO2, temperature, hydrology and carbon cycling.  Each objective will comprise: the development of the proxies in modern settings in collaboration with world-leading biogeochemists; creation of unprecedented and globally widespread geochemical records for the Eocene; and quantitative interpretation of our findings using climate/biogeochemical models.

- the total energy deposited in the calorimeter cells with a time tag in the 10 picosecond (ps) range;
- the high-precision spatial distribution of the energy deposition in the calorimetric volume both for low energy (photo-electric and Compton) and high energy (shower components);
- the time structure of the signals corresponding to the different components of the shower.
The key point in this novel approach is to introduce light production, collection and detection techniques that are now accessible due to spectacular technological advancements in this field, in which the PI is directly involved.  Examples are:

Identifying the causes of observed changes in climate requires an understanding of the natural, internally generated variability of the climate system, and of the response of climate to external influences. Our present knowledge is heavily weighted towards changes observed over the recent few decades. This proposal focuses on the early Anthropocene, namely the 19th through to the early 20th century. This period covers the emergence from an anomalously cold period, the so-called &#226;&#128;&#152;Little Ice Age&#226;&#128;&#153;, and shows periods of warming including the still enigmatic early 20th century warming. Newly available observational data now make it possible to analyze this period in detail. &#226;&#128;&#152;Fingerprints&#226;&#128;&#153; for climate changes in response to external drivers, such as changes in atmospheric composition, solar radiation, and volcanism will be used to estimate the contribution by these factors to observed changes over the 19th and early 20th century. These fingerprints will be based on a large, multi-model ensemble of climate model simulations that is presently becoming available.

It is the only way to proceed in order to correctly understand the various physical processes which rule the life of a star or a planet. The heart of the TOFU project is the development of an unique numerical tool, namely a three dimensional, time implicit and fully compressible hydrodynamical code, that allows the multi-dimensional description of a complete star (or planet) interior during timescales relevant to the study of various stellar/planetary evolutionary phases.
The major scientific motivation is to improve the description of key stellar/planetary physical processes and to solve long standing problems characterising the life of stars and planets. The development of such a tool is challenging and innovative, and has never been addressed to date. The time implicit approach provides the major innovation and breakthrough of this project as it will allow the exploration of physical processes on spatial and temporal scales presently out of reach. The TOFU project proposes a new vision of stellar/planetary evolution  based on a multi-D description  of anisotropic and non linear processes related to key problems in stellar evolution, like transport of angular momentum, disk accretion, pulsations and turbulent convection. The project will focus on three typical astrophysical examples at the heart of key investigations in stellar formation, evolution and asteroseismology, whose study requires multi-dimensional time implicit simulations.  Beyond these three main astrophysical applications, the project will open new avenues to explore a vast variety of problems in stellar/planetary physics.

Factors responsible for the effectiveness of a reaction include number/frequency of molecular collisions, orientation of molecules at the moment of collisions and their energy. Current reactors offer a very limited control of the above factors. Reactions usually take place in random geometries and the energy is brought to molecules by conductive heating which is non-selective and thermodynamically inefficient.

A groundbreaking solution here can only be achieved by creating a &#226;&#128;&#156;perfect&#226;&#128;&#157; reaction environment, in which the geometry of molecular collisions is fully controlled while energy is transferred selectively from the source to the required molecules in the required form, in the required amount, at the required moment, and at the required position. The current proposal aims at the first of its kind development of structured reactors using electric and electromagnetic fields for alignment, orientation and selective activation of targeted molecules. To engineer such &#226;&#128;&#156;perfect&#226;&#128;&#157; reaction environment the fundamental concepts of Process Intensification are applied. We build here on the Nobel Prize-awarded fundamental works in the area of the reaction dynamics and molecular reaction control that were not considered in chemical engineering thus far. Chemistries studied are mono- and bi-molecular reactions using CO2, CH4 and H2O, which are of paramount importance for clean fuel production and carbon dioxide management.

Only two years ago the first example of an entirely new form of magnetic order has been discovered, which is composed of topologically stable spin solitons (so called skyrmions) caused by chiral spin interactions. These skyrmions display several exceptional properties, e.g., great stability against perturbations and spin torque effects at ultra-low current densities. Because the underlying chiral interactions exist, in principle, in a very wide range of different settings a comprehensive search for similar spin solitons in other bulk compounds, thin films and especially at interfaces promises major break-throughs for information technology. For instance, the spin transfer torques at ultra-low current densities open an unexpected, new route to high-speed data processing. Further, the topological stability of the solitons may be exploited in non-volatile high-density data storage devices. Finally, the topological Hall effect caused by spin solitons may be used to build a new class of field sensors.

The objectives of this proposal are a systematic search for new forms of magnetic order composed of topologically protected (particle-like) spin solitons in bulk materials driven by chiral interactions. This will establish a new field of magnetic phenomena. We further propose the development of concepts how to exploit specifically the topological aspects of these spin solitons in information technology.

The TORCH (Time Of internally Reflected CHerenkov light) detector provides a time-of-flight measurement from the imaging of photons emitted in a 1 cm thick quartz radiator, based on the Cherenkov principle. The photons propagate by total internal reflection to the edge of the quartz plane and are then focused onto an array of Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) photon detectors at the periphery of the detector. A timing resolution of 15 ps per particle can be achieved over a flight distance of 10 m. This will allow particle identification in the challenging intermediate momentum region, up to 20 GeV/c. The TORCH detector is highly compact, and the technique will have wide-ranging use in particle and nuclear physics experiments, and especially those where space is at a premium.
The work involves a number of ground-breaking and challenging techniques. We will develop ultra-fast Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) photon detectors that can survive for several years in high radiation environments. The MCPs will be procured in industry to our specification with customized active area and granularity. We will also develop state-of-the-art electronics to read out the MCPs with picosecond precision.

The most significant development has been the demonstration of the first THz frequency quantum cascade laser (QCL) in 2002 by my EC FP-V consortium, WANTED. These advances have been accompanied by an equally important industrial applications-pull, with exploitation envisaged in the pharmaceutical and security sectors, for medical imaging and atmospheric sensing, and for high frequency electronics and communications. Yet, the enormous potential of the THz range has still to be unlocked, principally as there remains a lack of versatile, compact THz systems. My vision here is to address this, creating a step-change in the exploitation of THz technology. I will develop the patterning of periodic and aperiodic grating structures both lithographically, and for the first time, electronically, to engineer the photonic properties of THz QCLs. I will demonstrate the use of surface acoustic waves to modulate QCLs piezoelectrically, creating dynamically tunable sources. A continuous wave system-on-a-chip based on a QCL source, waveguide and integrated solid state detectors will be developed, together with an on-chip continuous-wave THz interferometer, and proven in the study of low-dimensional, nanostructured systems. I will develop a compact fibre-coupled broadband THz system, based on 1.55&#194;&#181;m fs-laser excitation of photoconductive antennae. Investigations into the fundamental science underlying THz QCLs will include magnetic field gain measurements of THz QCLs to probe the role of non-Markovian transport in superlattice optoelectronic structures.

Such a measurement would capture the complete information available in the optical signal, and significantly enhance our ability to observe the organisation, movement and interactions of cellular components at molecular scales. Advances in single molecule light microscopy are steadily improving our understanding of the processes underlying normal cellular function, and their alteration in disease states. However, these technologies are unable to reach their full potential due to their reliance on pre-existing, suboptimal detectors. A dedicated camera technology is now required to permit simultaneous, multidimensional measurements of large cohorts of molecules at high temporal and spatial (sub-diffraction limit) scales through total imaging of the photon flux.

Each pixel must be capable of capturing single photon parameters without compromising the high resolution and sensitivity achieved by current technology.  The ""total photon"" camera will be realised in nanoscale CMOS technology, based on recent breakthroughs in ultra-miniature single-photon detectors. We will combine these with novel approaches to pixel circuits, image processing and high-speed readout electronics to provide a fundamental research tool for the emerging area of computational microscopy.

The key idea which makes this project possible is the development of a specific femtosecond laser spectroscopy technique which allows us to distinguish the order parameter dynamics in complex matter systems from hot-electron energy relaxation, quasiparticle recombination processes, damping and dephasing of coherent phonon oscillations. This allows real-time high resolution investigations of the critical system trajectories through SBTs, beyond the capabilities of current state of the art time-resolved techniques. We will investigate coherent collective field oscillations and the fundamentals of topological defect creation by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism including a study of their annihilation in the aftermath of SBTs. We will aim to control the coherent trajectories at bifurcation points by laser pulses and external fields. We will address fundamental questions on the effect of symmetry and fundamental interactions of underlying microscopic vacua on global behaviour. Systems included in our study belong to a number of different universality classes and include the study of nontrivial transitions to newly discovered hidden states of matter. In the general framework of reductionism, we expect our findings to have fundamental bearing on our understanding of SBTs revealing predictive tell-tale signatures of critical events of relevance in areas beyond many-body condensed matter physics, in elementary particle physics, primordial cosmological events and tipping points in nonlinear systems.

Conventional traffic management faces limitations. During the last decade, there has been an enormous effort to develop a variety of Vehicle Automation and Communication Systems (VACS) that are expected to revolutionise the features and capabilities of individual vehicles. VACS are typically developed to benefit the individual vehicle, without a clear view for the implications, advantages and disadvantages they may have for the accordingly modified traffic characteristics. Thus, the introduction of VACS brings along the necessity and growing opportunities for adapted or utterly new traffic management.

It is the main objective of TRAMAN21 to develop the foundations and first steps that will pave the way towards a new era of motorway traffic management research and practice, which is indispensable for exploiting the evolving VACS deployment. TRAMAN21 assesses the relevance of VACS for improved traffic flow and develops specific options for a sensible upgrade of the traffic conditions, particularly at the network&#226;&#128;&#153;s weak points, i.e. at bottlenecks and incident locations. The proposed work comprises the development of new traffic flow modelling and control approaches on the basis of appropriate methods from many-particle Physics, Automatic Control and Optimisation. A field trial is included, aiming at a preliminary testing and demonstration of the developed concepts.

TRAMAN21 risk stems from the uncertainty in the VACS evolution, which is a challenge for the required modelling and control developments. But, if successful, TRAMAN21 will contribute to a substantial reduction of the estimated annual European traffic congestion cost of 120 billion &#226;&#130;&#172; and related environmental pollution and will trigger further innovative developments and a new era of traffic flow modelling and control research.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,496,880</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSATLANTICILAB"><Rcn>192337</Rcn><Nid>13446</Nid><HI>Institut De Physique Du Globe De Paris, France</HI><Name>Trans-Atlantic Imaging of Lithosphere Asthenosphere Boundary</Name><PI>Satish Chandra Singh</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The Plate Tectonics Theory is the most important discovery in all of earth sciences. It is based on the concept of plates (lithosphere) that float over the asthenosphere. Although the lithosphere is a basic building block of the plate tectonics theory, its nature, its thickness, its boundary with the asthenosphere (LAB) are still matter of heated debates. Here we propose to image the LAB and internal structure of the lithosphere at a very high-resolution using a combination of different geophysical methods in a systematic manner across the Atlantic Ocean (Trans-Atlantic) for a lithosphere of 0-100 Ma age. Along with using seismological and magnetotelluric methods, we propose to use a technology newly developed for the oil and gas exploration that is capable of providing a seismic reflection image down to 120 km depth with a few hundred metres resolution, resolving the controversy on the formation and evolution of the oceanic lithosphere once and for all, filling the gap between seismological and seismic reflection methods, opening up a new frontier of research, and creating synergy between academic and industrial research to address fundamental scientific problems. These new seismic data should also provide images of melt lenses in the mantle beneath the spreading centre axis, if present, which will help us to build a new model of melt generation and migration from the mantle. We should also be able to image deep penetrating faults that might have been generated due to the cooling of the lithosphere as it moved away from the spreading centre, allowing the development of a new model of hydration of the oceanic lithosphere, which would be extremely valuable for the understanding of the earthquake process at subduction zones. The imaging of the structure down to 120 km in an oceanic environment would be a major breakthrough, and likely to open up new horizons for deep seismic imaging.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,499,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSFORM OPTICS"><Rcn>107364</Rcn><Nid>11428</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Transformation optics: cloaking, perfect imaging and horizons</Name><PI>Ulf Leonhardt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Transformation optics grew out of ideas for invisibility cloaking devices and exploits connections between electromagnetism in media and in geometries.

Probably the most important practical application of connections between media and geometries is perfect imaging, the ability to optically transfer images with a resolution not limited by the wavelength. This is because imaging lies at the heart of photolithography, the key technology used for making electronic chips.

The new subject became known as Tropical Geometry since algebraically it is a based on the so-called ``Tropical Calculus'' of Computer Science. In the tropical world the curves are metric graphs, sometimes enhanced with additional structure. Stepping forward from my recent successes in set-up and application of Tropical Geometry I plan to continue this work. Particularly I plan to advance the following challenging lines of research:

Already our recent results have shown that graphene buckling of any form can be suppressed by embedding the flakes into polymer matrices. We have indeed quantified this effect for any flake geometry and have produced master curves relating geometrical aspects to compression strain-to-failure. In the proposed work, we will make good use of this finding by altering the geometry of the flakes and thus design graphene strips (micro-ribbons) of specific dimensions which when embedded to polymer matrices can be stretched to large deformation and even failure without simultaneous buckling in the other direction. This is indeed the only route possible for the exploitation of the potential of graphene as an efficient reinforcement in composites. Since orthogonal buckling during stretching is expected to alter- among other things- the Dirac spectrum and consequently the electronic properties of graphene, we intend to use the technique of Raman spectroscopy to produce stress/ strain maps in two dimensions in order to quantify fully this effect from the mechanical standpoint. Finally, another option for ironing out the wrinkles is to apply a simultaneous thermal field during tensile loading. This will give rise to a biaxial stretching of graphene which presents another interesting field of study particularly for already envisaged applications of graphene in flexible displays and coatings.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,025,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Terauniverse"><Rcn>98149</Rcn><Nid>8937</Nid><HI>European Organization For Nuclear Research, Switzerland</HI><Name>Exploring the Terauniverse with the LHC, Astrophysics and Cosmology</Name><PI>Jonathan Richard Ellis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The visible matter in the Universe is well described by the Standard Model, but this leaves open major questions in both particle physics and cosmology that may be answered by new physics at the Tera-electron-Volt range: the Terascale.

This interdisciplinary approach will also facilitate the application of knowledge acquired from the LHC to fundamental cosmological and astrophysical problems, as well as illuminate future collider priorities, e.g., for LHC upgrades and/or a linear collider. This proposal will bring together particle theorists, experimentalists, astroparticle physicists and experts on field and string theory in the framework of a new &#226;&#128;&#152;London Centre for Terauniverse Studies&#226;&#128;&#153;. This will provide new opportunities for students and other young researchers to get directly involved in making LHC discoveries and exploring their implications for the Universe, and provide a mechanism for transferring to them interdisciplinary skills.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,928,700</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ThirdWaveHCI"><Rcn>90262</Rcn><Nid>11603</Nid><HI>Goldsmiths' College, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Third Wave HCI: Methods, Domains and Concepts</Name><PI>William Gaver</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal is for interdisciplinary research that will help bring to maturity the emerging paradigm of  third-wave HCI , which addresses interaction as situated meaning-making in everyday life. With my established interdisciplinary research team, I will design prototypes that show how third-wave thinking is relevant for domains of recognised importance to help bring this paradigm to the centre of HCI. We will develop an integrated set of tactics and orienting concepts based on our practice to elucidate and support research and design in third-wave HCI. Crucially, we will develop a new methodology for this research, based on the deployment and study of 50   100 batch-produced prototypes in real-world situations. This will mark a significant leap forward, allowing prototype technologies to be studied using social scientific and design-led methods in field trials several orders of magnitude larger than normal   a development from which third-wave HCI, with its commitment to multiple, local appropriations, will benefit enormously.  The project will be centred around two Case Studies in which we will develop robust and highly finished prototypes, batch produce them in large numbers, deploy them in large-scale field studies with members of the general public as well as specialist commentators, and use a variety of traditional and experimental methods to capture their experiences.  The first Case Study will produce a suite of electromechanically extended sensors that provide resources for environmental awareness in the home without being judgmental or didactic. The second Case Study will develop mobile devices that display readymade, location-based information to provide a  behind the scenes  view of local neighbourhoods.  When dozens of these prototypes are in use simultaneously, we will be able to observe as communities of practice form, and a hundred different stories emerge, leading to a transformative coming-of-age for third-wave HCI.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,439,757</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ToMCaT"><Rcn>110053</Rcn><Nid>10252</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Theory of Mantle, Core and Technological Materials</Name><PI>Ronald Cohen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE10, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>I propose to work full time on this ERC Advanced project to predict properties of Earth and technological materials using fundamental physics, spending half of my time at University College London, building a research group, and educating students and post-docs. I compute properties of minerals and melts to better understand them, and estimate properties when data are unavailable. The latter has been important in the Earth sciences, starting with my prediction of the elastic constants of silicate perovskite, the most common mineral in the Earth, before they were measured. This project will constrain properties of major problematic minerals, melts, and aqueous fluids crucial to modelling of the Earth, including equations of state, phase transitions, electrical and thermal conductivity, chemical diffusivity, and viscosity and rheology.  This project will concentrate on iron and other transition metal bearing Earth materials, for which conventional electronic structure methods are inadequate. Whereas properties of closed-shell atomic systems and simple met-als can now be computed to accuracy limited only by available computing time, open-shelled systems have been problematic. Standard methods give FeO as a metal, but it is an insulator. My recent work on FeO showing that it becomes metallic under lower mantle conditions is requiring reconsideration of many areas in geophysics, ranging from heat flow from the core to the mantle, and fluctuations in the length of the day. We will apply dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) within an accurate framework and ground state Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC DMC) to compute properties of iron-bearing minerals and melts and their impact on the Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s behaviour. We will simulate C-H-O fluids to understand slab dewatering and mantle fluids. We will study useful technological materials and design new ones exploiting their synergy with Earth materials.

The goal is to develop efficient solar energy convertors based on cheap and abundant materials that offer prospects to be employed on large scale and contribute to global conversion and storage of solar energy.

Presently, state-of-the-art polymer solar cells reach power conversion efficiencies of  ~10% in solar light. Projected efficiencies are as high as 20% when multi-junction solar cells can be employed. Closing this gap is a tremendous challenge that will require pushing every single step in the conversion process to its intrinsic limits, eliminating losses close to perfection. In addition to efficient conversion, storage of energy is crucial because solar electricity supply and demand are intermittent. Capturing solar energy in chemical bonds of molecular fuels is most effective in terms energy density and the first firm ideas are emerging on how this can be achieved. We will use our expertise in the area of polymer solar cells to create multi-junction molecular solar-to-electricity conversion devices with unprecedented power conversion efficiencies and develop new concepts for efficient solar-to-chemical conversion.

To reach these ambitious goals, the project focuses on investigating fundamental questions regarding charge generation and on developing new organic materials, electrocatalysts and devices for solar-to-electricity and solar-to-fuel conversion. The activities involve designing and synthesizing new materials, performing photophysical and morphological studies, analyzing charge and exciton transport in relation to morphology, developing new interfacial layers, electrocatalysis, and exploring the use of multi-junction configuration devices in solar cells and artificial leaves.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,585</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ULTIMATE CERAMICS"><Rcn>102188</Rcn><Nid>9939</Nid><HI>Oulun Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Printed Electroceramics with Ultimate Compositions</Name><PI>Heli Maarit Jantunen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The ultimate goal of this research is to make extremely advanced leap enabling processing of wide variety of ceramic materials at ultra low temperatures denoted as ULTIMATE CERAMICS(200-500 oC).

The advent of wide-field synoptic sky surveys has opened up a new parameter space which allows very large volumes of the Universe to be searched for explosive stars. A new class of ""ultra-luminous"" supernovae have been discovered that challenge our physical understanding. These optical transients are typically 20-100 times brighter than normal supernovae and the physical mechanism that produces their huge luminosity is not well understood. A proportion of them may be &#226;&#128;&#156;pair-instability&#226;&#128;&#157; supernovae, which have been predicted only to exist in the early Universe and result from the evolution of Population III metal free stars. The existence of this ultra-luminous population of explosions in the nearby Universe is now certain, but what their nature is and what fraction really are &#226;&#128;&#156;pair-instability&#226;&#128;&#157; supernovae remains to be determined. The Pan-STARRS is a novel wide-field synoptic telescope survey  which sweeps the sky to find moving objects and optical transients. I have secured leadership roles in the survey which will allow me to quantify this population of ultra-luminous supernovae at low and high redshift and to uncover their true nature. This will pave the way for searching for them at the highest redshifts with future space missions, possibly pushing into the era of reonization at z ~ 6, and determining whether the first supernovae in the Universe can be observed. Theoretical calculations for the number of Population III supernovae (from the first stars) have predicted low numbers of detections.  The recent surprising discovery that these pair-instability supernovae may exist in the local Universe, and appear confined to low-metallicity galaxies, could potentially alter these predictions dramatically."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,315,044</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UNIQDS"><Rcn>110750</Rcn><Nid>12428</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Universal Framework for Charge Transport in Quantum Dot Systems</Name><PI>Jong Min Kim</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The field of quantum dots (QDs) is one of the major growth areas in interdisciplinary field of physics, materials, chemistry, and engineering for the exploration of fundamental physical properties and potential/new functionalities. This will serve as a basis for creation of unique applications such as new display/lighting, photovoltaic device, TFTs and image sensors. However, there are serious impediments to the device performance such as high efficiency and longer life time due to the lack of understanding in charge transport and light-matter interaction mechanism in QD networks. Therefore, the proposed work is a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of underlying physics for charge transport in i) a single QD and surface, ii) QD/QD, iii) QD/interface/matrix, iv) QD/layer and /electrode, and v) bulk QD network systems and the creation of any real devices with new functionality. Enormous opportunities will arise from many unanswered questions of general nature/fundamental physical aspects of QDs related to charge transport that have still to be addressed. Thus, we will highlight and focus on strongly linked key themes and challenges that are at the heart of our proposed work. The main emphasis of proposed work will be on the understanding and control of charge transport dynamics in various QD systems, even though we explore the development of meaningful technologies and new devices based on QDs in the proposal. Our most intriguing issue is to expand the basic understanding of QDs for their potential applications. We will study interface dipole design/control, computational engineering for charge transport, analysis of the above five subsets, and will realise them into a full system with QD networks. Another challenge lies in integrating new QD materials with flexible/large-area substrates by monolayer-level control. We also propose the development of new synthetic routes for QDs with stable surface for supporting the above charge transport. This work will be underpinning research aimed at the development of the charge transport based QD devices with high efficiency and longer lifetime. These provide enormous opportunities to enable us not only to broaden and deepen our knowledge/experience in this area, but also to make rational predictions and open new device/system concepts unique to QD networks.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,454,650</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UNIVERSALEPTO"><Rcn>100197</Rcn><Nid>11162</Nid><HI>The University Of Liverpool, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Test of Lepton Flavour Universality with Kaon Decays</Name><PI>John Bourke Dainton</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Physics at the high-mass scale can also be manifest in dynamical effects at lower, accessible energy. Thus, the existence of new high-mass-scale physics implies new mechanisms by which new interactions between constituents, quarks and gluons with leptons, must also exist. This proposal is for a precision measurement at the NA62 experiment at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) of the ratio R(K) of the branching ratios (BR) of two rare, leptonic, decays of the K+, namely K+ to e+ neutrino and K+ to mu+ neutrino, with a precision of 0.2%. When compared with the prediction of the Standard Model (uncertainty 4E-4), the measurement will be sensitive to physics at the Terascale (TeV energy). The experiment is based on a sample of about 10E13 in-flight K+ decays, for which selection and background rejection exploit precision kinematic reconstruction and particle identification. The team will contribute a Cerenkov detector, which will time-stamp individual K +decays in the decay volume of the experiment at the 50 MHz K+ beam rate. When operating in the NA62 experiment, the sensitivity to K decay BRs will then be better than 10E-11. Such a measurement of R(K) will certainly constrain in a unique manner the nature of Terascale physics. The reality of measurements at this level of precision, which may point to lepton flavour violation, will make possible a number of definitive tests concerned with the violation of lepton flavour universality. The importance of the measurements is therefore compelling, and especially so when taken in the context of imminent measurements using long baseline neutrino beams.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,282,255</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="URSAT"><Rcn>106970</Rcn><Nid>12963</Nid><HI>Technion - Israel Institute Of Technology, Israel</HI><Name>Understanding Random Systems via Algebraic Topology</Name><PI>Robert Joseph Adler</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Over the past decade there has been a significant expansion of activity in applying the techniques and theory of algebraic topology to real world problems. The expression  `applied algebraic topology' is no longer an oxymoron! This expansion has generated new mathematical theory, new computational techniques, and even commercial startups.  However, there is still an important component of this topological approach that has not been treated in any depth, and this is the inherently stochastic nature of the world. Consequently, there is an urgent need to complement recent developments, which have been primarily deterministic, with sophisticated stochastic modelling and analysis. The current proposal aims to attack this issue   by applying algebraic topological thinking to random systems.

Over the past two years, the PI Adler and colleagues have organised workshops in Banff, Palo Alto and Chicago with tens of researchers from topology, probability, statistics, random networks, image analysis and other areas, with the aim of defining the important problems that  `random algebraic topology' should address. These brain trusts have born fruit in terms of setting some clearly defined goals, many of which help  motivate the core of the current proposal, which is by far the most ambitious of a number of earlier and current projects.

These endeavours are expected to have -- and are to a considerable part driven by -- applications to areas outside of mathematics, while at the same time having deep, intrinsic, mathematical interest. The multi-faceted aspect of the proposal, involving a number of areas within mathematics that do not usually appear together, is highly  novel and requires the setting up of a large and coordinated team of researchers.

Although whiskers reach strength values close to this limit they cannot be used in the design of load bearing structures. Currently the typical strength of the structural materials in use is only in the range of few % of this theoretical limit. Premature plastic deformation and failure due to flaws are the main reasons for this distinctive lower limit. For engineering applications, adequate fracture toughness is required which permits a ductile behaviour and certain strength even in the presence of flaws or cracks. The strength of the strongest metallic materials is only 10 % of the theoretical limit. Increasing the strength of metallic high strength materials by a few percent is usually associated with an unacceptable decrease in fracture toughness and results in a very flaw sensitive strength similar to that known for ceramics. In pearlitic steel wires it was possible to overcome this 10% limitation significantly. In the last years for the first time a strength of 6.3 GPa was obtained for this material which is about 30% of the theoretical limit or 3 times stronger than other high strength steels. The group of the PI has shown that these wires have an exceptional toughness equivalent to a high damage tolerance. The proposed ERC-grant should permit the analysis of the phenomena for this superior combination of strength and ductility. The knowledge of the essential required architectural features of this nano-composite and the necessary properties of the individual phases as well as their interfaces will be used to design nano-architectures also in other materials to obtain such exceptional properties. The developed skill in the generation of nano-composites from coarse constituents will be used for the production of similar nano-composites, the proof of developed concepts, and the generation of new ultra strong materials.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,445,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UltraNMR"><Rcn>94085</Rcn><Nid>9148</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Ultrafast Hyperpolarized NMR and MRI in Multiple Dimensions</Name><PI>Lucio Frydman</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (nD NMR) plays a unique role in Science as a primary tool for the characterization of biomolecules, as part of drug-discovery processes, and in clinical imaging (MRI). Further progress in NMR is hampered by this spectroscopy s low sensitivity, arising from the weak interactions that it involves. The prospects of solving this problem by continuing with incremental bigger machines approaches are poor, given the high maturity reached by existing technologies. The present Project deals with this issue by departing from traditional concepts, and relying on two incipient but highly promising developments in the field. One of these pertains ex situ dynamic nuclear hyperpolarization, an approach capable of eliciting liquid state NMR signals that surpass those afforded by the highest-field spectrometers by factors e10,000. While capable of providing super-signals hyperpolarization has the drawback of involving irreversible changes in the physical state of the sample. This makes it incompatible with nD NMR technologies, requiring the collection of multiple scans identical to one another except for systematic delay variations. As second component in this high-risk/high-gain Project we propose merging hyperpolarization with "ultrafast" methods that we have recently developed for completing arbitrary nD NMR/MRI acquisitions within a single scan. The resulting synergy could increase sensitivity by orders of magnitude, while demanding negligibly small amounts of spectrometer/scanner time to complete nD acquisitions. This should provide an ideal starting point for the analysis of a variety of organic and structural biology problems, and provide new tools to explore in vivo metabolism focusing on cancer biomarkers.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,780</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UltraPhase"><Rcn>103154</Rcn><Nid>11021</Nid><HI>Universitat Konstanz, Germany</HI><Name>Ultrafast Quantum Physics in Amplitude and Phase</Name><PI>Alfred Leitenstorfer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Ultrafast phenomena related to and/or accessible only via the absolute temporal phase of electronic, vibrational and spin coherent excitations in condensed matter are studied via electromagnetic transients in the multi-terahertz regime.

(ii) Studying nonclassical light emission predicted to emerge after non-adiabatic perturbation of ultrastrongly coupled systems of light and matter.

However, both concepts are usually limited to one medium/solvent, although they are related through the gaseous hydrogen atom delivering the proton for Br&#195;&#184;nsted acidity and the electron for redox chemistry.
Here we describe, how the ideal proton gas and the ideal electron gas form the reference states for our absolute pH Br&#195;&#184;nsted acidity scale (Angew. Chem. 2010) and the related absolute pe redox scale. Both can be combined to the Protoelectric Potential Map (PPM) that allows studying and understanding any redox or acid base reaction over solvent and even phase boundaries in dependence of the pHabs and peabs. First examples for this PPM are included with the proposal and ways how to establish anchor points for this two-dimensional PPM scale are delineated. It should be noted that this unifying concept is thermodynamically exact and makes full use of all hitherto available (experimental or calculated) pKa-values, Gibbs transfer energies and electrochemical standard potentials in either aqueous or non-aqueous solution. Even coupling to the gaseous or solid state is possible.

My objects of study are systems consisting of a large number of random components that interact locally but exhibit a global dependence. Typically, the components of these systems are subject to a simple microscopic dynamics. The challenge lies in understanding the complex macroscopic phenomena that may arise from this dynamics. Core to my proposal are macroscopic phenomena that are very hard to grasp with heuristic or numerical methods: pinning, localisation, collapse, porosity, nature vs. nurture, metastability, condensation, ageing, catalysis, intermittency and trapping. My main line of attack is to combine large deviation theory, which is a well-established technically demanding yet flexible instrument, with a number of new variational techniques that I have recently developed with my international collaborators, which are based on space-time coarse-graining. My goal is to apply this powerful combination to a number of complex systems that are at the very heart of the research area, in order to arrive at a complete mathematical description. The idea is to use the coarse-graining techniques to compute the probability of the possible trajectories of the microscopic dynamics, and to identify the most likely trajectory by maximising this probability in terms of a variational formula. The solution of this variational formual is what describes the macroscopic behaviour of the system, including the emergence of phase transitions. My proposal focuses on five highly intriguing classes of random interacting systems that are among the most challenging to date: (1) polymer chains; (2) porous domains; (3) flipping magnetic spins; (4) lattice gases; (5) evolving random media. The unique reward of the variational approach is that it leads to a full insight into why these systems behave the way they do."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,930,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VERIWARE"><Rcn>94340</Rcn><Nid>11297</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>From Software Verification to Everyware Verification</Name><PI>Marta Zofia Kwiatkowska</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"In the words of Adam Greenfield, the age of ubiquitous computing is here: a computing without computers, where information processing has diffused into everyday life, and virtually disappeared from view . Conventional hardware and software has evolved into everyware sensor-enabled electronic devices, virtually invisible and wirelessly connected on which we increasingly often rely for everyday activities and access to services such as banking and healthcare. The key component of everyware is embedded software, continuously interacting with its environment by means of sensors and actuators. Ubiquitous computing must deal with the challenges posed by the complex scenario of communities of everyware , in presence of environmental uncertainty and resource limitations, while at the same time aiming to meet high-level expectations of autonomous operation, predictability and robustness. This calls for the use of quantitative measures, stochastic modelling, discrete and continuous dynamics and goal-driven approaches, which the emerging quantitative software verification is unable to address at present. The central premise of the proposal is that there is a need for a paradigm shift in verification to enable everyware verification, which can be achieved through a model-based approach that admits discrete and continuous dynamics, the replacement of offline methods with online techniques such as machine learning, and the use of game-theoretic and planning techniques. The project will significantly advance quantitative probabilistic verification in new and previously unexplored directions. I will lead a team of researchers investigating the fundamental principles of everyware verification, development of algorithms and prototype implementations, and experimenting with case studies. I will also provide continued scientific leadership in the area of ubiquitous computing."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,060,360</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VHIA"><Rcn>111320</Rcn><Nid>12583</Nid><HI>Institut National De Recherche Eninformatique Et Automatique, France</HI><Name>Vision and Hearing in Action</Name><PI>Patrice Horaud</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The objective of VHIA is to elaborate a holistic computational paradigm of perception and of perception-action loops. We plan to develop a completely novel twofold approach: (i) learn from mappings between auditory/visual inputs and structured outputs, and from sensorimotor contingencies, and (ii) execute perception-action interaction cycles in the real world with a humanoid robot. VHIA will achieve a unique fine coupling between methodological findings and proof-of-concept implementations using the  consumer humanoid NAO manufactured in Europe. The proposed multimodal approach is in strong contrast with current computational paradigms influenced by unimodal biological theories. These theories have hypothesized a modular view, postulating quasi-independent and parallel perceptual pathways in the brain. VHIA will also take a radically different view than today's audiovisual fusion models that rely on clean-speech signals and on accurate frontal-images of faces; These models assume that  videos and sounds are recorded with hand-held or head-mounted sensors, and hence there is a human in the loop who intentionally supervises perception and interaction. Our approach deeply contradicts the belief that complex and expensive humanoids (often manufactured in Japan) are required to implement research ideas. VHIA's methodological program addresses extremely difficult issues: how to build a joint audiovisual space from heterogeneous, noisy,  ambiguous and physically different visual and auditory stimuli,  how to model seamless interaction, how to deal with high-dimensional input data, and how to achieve robust and efficient human-humanoid communication tasks through a well-thought tradeoff between offline training and online execution. VHIA bets on the high-risk idea that in the next decades, social robots will have a considerable economical impact, and there will be millions of humanoids, in our homes, schools and offices, which will  be able to naturally communicate with us."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,296</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VIN"><Rcn>88962</Rcn><Nid>13017</Nid><HI>Aarhus Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Video-rate Scanning Probe Microscopy Imaging of Nanostructures on Surfaces</Name><PI>Flemming Besenbacher</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The goal of this ERC proposal VIN is to develop the next generation of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) The microscopes will set new standards in the field through their ability to acquire images at video-rate frequency, while retaining high (atomic) resolution capability.

Structure has long been considered to be the key information and several powerful techniques like X-ray crystallography and multidimensional NMR have been developed, following the notion that  seeing is believing,  to provide equilibrium (static) structures of molecules. At the same time function of a molecular system implies change of structure and in order to characterize and understand how a biomolecule or material works it is necessary to know how and why the structural changes occur. The How is related to finding out precisely which structural changes occur, which atoms are involved, how are they affected, which bonds are broken, how does energy and charge flow through the molecule, and what are the temporal characteristics of the changes. The Why is associated to energetics and interactions   what is the energy landscape that connects reactants, intermediates and products and how do molecules interact with each other and with their environment? Structural and dynamical information is today generally obtained in separate experiments   static structures from X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and multidimensional NMR, while molecular time scale dynamics are obtained from e.g. ultrafast laser spectroscopy. Dynamics from such experiments does not provide direct information on structural changes, but has to be inferred from often sophisticated analysis of spectroscopic data. Thus, there is a great need for experiments that can provide direct information on structural changes occurring on the molecular time scale of picoseconds and femtoseconds. The goal of this project is to develop a table-top experimental setup for sub-ps X-ray spectroscopy to obtain molecular time scale geometrical and electronic structural information of chemical and biological processes for deeper insights into molecular reaction mechanisms."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,056,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2008-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VISIONSPACE"><Rcn>89740</Rcn><Nid>12690</Nid><HI>University Of Strathclyde, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Visionary Space Systems: Orbital Dynamics at Extremes of Spacecraft Length-Scale</Name><PI>Colin Robert Mcinnes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This ground-breaking project will deliver radically new approaches to orbital dynamics at extremes of spacecraft length-scale to underpin new space-derived products and services for Europe.

The project will investigate key topics that will provide the understanding to increase societal risk and reduce vulnerability of communities. The project will: investigate how volcanoes work focussing on the nature and dynamics of magma chambers; construct a global database on volcanic hazards and risk; and develop new approaches to assessment of volcanic risk. The magma chamber is the fundamental control on the behaviour of most volcanoes, and so an advance in understanding of their physical nature and behaviour affects almost every other aspect of volcano behaviour and phenomena. Integrated models of the formation and behaviour of magma chambers will be take account of heat transfer, crustal deformation, magma properties, and internal chamber processes. Volcano behaviour will be investigated in terms of magma flows from chambers to the Earth s surface. The models will be informed by and tested against geophysical, geochemical and observational data at selected volcanoes and igneous intrusions characterised by superb datasets. An integrated model of magma chambers will improve interpretations of geophysical data and understanding of hazardous volcanic phenomena, such as debris avalanches, pyroclastic flows and lahars. The project will create a global database on volcanic eruptions, their hazards and key risk factors (such as population density), which will be analysed to provide robust data for hazard and risk assessment at global, regional and local scales. New methods of probabilistic risk assessment will be developed, which combine hard and soft data, take account of uncertainties and integrate information on vulnerability and hazard. The research will include a study of risk perception as a key factor in vulnerability by comparing communities in different volcanic settings and across cultures.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,488,957</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VSSC"><Rcn>107220</Rcn><Nid>9522</Nid><HI>Tel Aviv University, Israel</HI><Name>Verifying and Synthesizing Software Compositions</Name><PI>Shmuel (Mooly) Sagiv</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the first things a programmer must commit to in developing any significant piece of software is the representation of the data. In applications where performance or memory consumption is important, this representation is often quite complex: the data may be indexed in multiple ways and use a variety of concrete, interlinked data structures. The current situation, in which programmers either directly write these data structures themselves or use a standard data structure library, leads to two problems:
1:The particular choice of data representation is based on an expectation of what the most common workloads will be; that is, the programmer has already made cost-benefit trade-offs based on the expected distribution of operations the program will perform on these data structures.
2: It is difficult for the programmer to check or even express the high-level consistency properties of complex structures, especially when these structures are shared. This also makes software verification in existing programming languages very hard.
We will investigate specification languages for describing and reasoning program data at a much higher level. The hope is that this can reduce the inherited complexity of reasoning about programs. In tandem, we will check if the high level specifications can be semi-automatically mapped specifications to efficient data representations.
A novel aspect of our approach allows the user to define global invariants and a restricted set of high level operations, and only then to synthesize a representation that both adheres to the invariants and is highly specialized to exactly the set of operations the user requires. In contrast, the classical approach in databases is to assume nothing about the queries that must be answered; the representation must support all possible operations.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,577,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VarCity"><Rcn>103574</Rcn><Nid>10530</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Variation &amp; the City</Name><PI>Luc S.

Not only will large-scale city modeling be automated, but the results will look more realistic, will be more compact and will be semantically structured. Moreover, the dynamics of traffic flows will be added as animations (to safeguard anonymity) and videos of special events and landmarks can be retrieved with the 3D model as geographical context. These videos of flows and events are again automatically analysed and combined. For the combination of multiple event videos, a virtual editor will be implemented, ensuring compilations of high quality and providing an excellent overview whenever possible. The overall result will be an augmented, live Google street.
The modeling is based on three types of input data: 1) dedicated mobile mapping imagery taken from several synchronized cameras mounted on a van, 2) images of landmarks and corresponding Wikipedia pages mined from public Internet repositories, and 3) the large amount of videos people can expect to stream from their mobile phones in the near future (given e.g. the upcoming LTE). With respect to the latter VarCity thus takes a proactive stand, but such data are easy to simulate. The other data types are already available to the project, through spin-off companies.
For the modeling of the architectural structures, procedural methods will be used. Starting from the images, procedural models of the buildings are generated as instantiations of their architectural style, expressed in a style grammar. The key idea underlying much of the work is to let visual object class recognition and detection feed back into what traditionally are considered `low-level&#226;&#128;&#153; vision processes. This approach will enhance several aspects of the work, including the inverse procedural modeling, event detection, traffic flow analysis, inpainting, level-of-detail, super-resolution, etc.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,441,893</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VideoWorld"><Rcn>97655</Rcn><Nid>11777</Nid><HI>Institut National De Recherche En Informatique Et En Automatique, France</HI><Name>Modeling, interpreting and manipulating digital video</Name><PI>Jean Ponce</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Digital video is everywhere, at home, at work, and on the Internet. Yet, effective technology for
organizing, retrieving, improving, and editing its content is nowhere to be found. Models for video content, interpretation and manipulation inherited from still imagery are obsolete, and new ones must be invented. With a new convergence between computer vision, machine learning, and signal processing, the time is right for such an endeavor. Concretely, we will develop novel spatio-temporal models of video content learned from training data and capturing both the local
appearance and nonrigid motion of the elements---persons and their surroundings---that make up a dynamic scene. We will also develop formal models of the video interpretation process that leave behind the architectures inherited from the world of still images to capture the complex interactions between these elements, yet can be learned effectively despite the sparse annotations typical of video understanding scenarios. Finally, we will propose a unified model for
video restoration and editing that builds on recent advances in sparse coding and dictionary learning, and will allow for unprecedented control of the video stream.

The extent of the wet base and distribution of melt water are poorly known. Also lakes under the ice have not been discovered in contrast with those in Antarctica. The effect of the water beneath the ice, however, is well documented: it lubricates the bed and removes the friction between the basal ice and underlying bedrock. The ice with a wet bed flows faster, reacts rapidly to changes in climate and the basal-melt water contributes to the fresh-water supply to the ocean from the Greenland ice sheet. The primary objectives of the project are to map melt water extent of the Greenland ice sheet and its impact by tracing internal layers and analyzing bedrock returns from airborne radio-echo sounding data, and use mapping results in conjunction with ice-sheet and hydrostatic models for the movement of the basal water to predict the ice-sheet s response to climate change. The information derived from deep ice-cores that reach the bed will be used to constrain models. We will also study the basal material (dust, DNA and microbiological material) and bedrock properties from the deep-ice core sites. This will add a further dimension to the study and provide opportunities to look for life under the ice and constrain the age of the Greenland ice sheet. The proposed research is a high risk project because of the difficulty in accessing basal conditions under 3-km of ice with a potential for high payoff science.

The aim of this project is to produce the first deep, homogeneous all-sky sample of single and binary white dwarfs. I will achieve this ambitious goal by using the combined wealth of information that ongoing deep surveys, spanning the ultraviolet to mid-infrared, collect for about a billion objects in our Galaxy. My analysis and follow-up study of this new sample will advance our understanding of all aspects of the evolution of white dwarfs by at least an order of magnitude, and will produce answers to a wide range of fundamental questions:

Much of the water on Mars exists today in the form of hydrated minerals that incorporate molecular water or hydroxyl into their crystalline structure. Hydrated minerals provide a tool for studying the past history of the hydrosphere on Mars as well as Earth. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of hydration water in minerals record information about the conditions under which the minerals form and subsequently interact with fluids after deposition. This proposal outlines the technological and scientific basis for a new approach to the isotopic study of hydration water in minerals and mineraloids. The recent availability of  tunable diode lasers now permits the measurement of water isotopes by laser absorption spectroscopy at a precision equal to or better than conventional methods. This development opens new opportunities for studying the isotope composition of mineral hydration water in novel ways, which hitherto has been difficult or impossible. I propose a five-year program to establish a research group at the University of Cambridge to study the nature of water isotopes in hydrated minerals: (1) how many different types of hydration states of water are present and how they are fixed into the mineral structure; (2) how the isotopic composition varies among the differently bound water in minerals; (3) how the type of bonding of water in minerals affects the rate of isotopic exchange with external water; and (4) whether or not any of the hydration water has retained its isotopic composition from the time of formation. The project will include both a theoretical (ab initio simulations) and empirical approach that has the potential to transform our understanding of mineral hydration water and its isotopic composition.

Optical techniques play a major role in quantitative chemical analysis and are the mainstay of detection in &#226;&#128;&#156;lab-on-chip&#226;&#128;&#157; systems, but the degree of optical functionality integrated in these systems remains extremely limited, and they have yet to benefit fully from the recent massive growth in photonics communications technologies.

New approaches to clinical point-of-care diagnostics will be enabled by realising a mass-manufacturable monolithically-integrated photonics/optofluidic technology for chemical and biochemical analysis in the near and mid-infrared, exploiting advanced spectroscopic techniques for accessible biomedical diagnostic"</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,062,006</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="WalkingMols"><Rcn>88829</Rcn><Nid>9698</Nid><HI>The University Of Manchester, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Synthetic Molecules that Walk Down Tracks: The First Small-Molecule Linear Motors</Name><PI>David Alan Leigh</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The goal of this research project is to make the first synthetic small-molecule structures that can walk down tracks, mimicking the types of movement exhibited by the biological motor proteins myosin, kinesin and dynein. We propose to construct the first synthetic, mechanically processive, chemical systems from first principles; i.e. to design, synthesize, operate and characterize wholly synthetic small molecule structures that progressively advance directionally along a molecular  track  in response to stimuli. Different principles ( passing leg  and  inchworm  mechanisms) for processive mechanical molecular-level motion will be developed and experimentally explored. With some designs it is envisaged that the  walker  units will be able to change direction or switch between pathways as a result of external signaling or the nature of the environment and, ultimately, be able to transport a cargo from one place to another on a surface.  Sequential processive movement is unprecedented for wholly synthetic molecular structures and is the key requirement for making translational/linear motors that can perform tasks (transport cargoes from place to place or progressively exert a force) at the molecular level. Its successful demonstration would be a landmark accomplishment and mark a major new direction for synthetic supramolecular chemistry and molecular nanotechnology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,256,401</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Wear3D"><Rcn>111025</Rcn><Nid>10146</Nid><HI>Koc University, Turkey</HI><Name>Wearable Augmented Reality 3D Displays</Name><PI>Hakan Urey</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Wearable displays have advanced rapidly over the past few decades but they are limited in field-of-view due to optical constraints. Likewise, 3D displays have several technological and viewing discomfort limitations. These limitations result from the missing 3D depth cues in stereoscopic displays, which are essential for real 3D and for interactive augmented reality (AR) applications. Wear3D proposal aims to overcome the two fundamental scientific challenges of wearable displays and make them as natural as wearing a pair of eyeglasses: (i) Eliminate the relay lenses. We need to overcome the focusing problem of the eyes in order to completely eliminate the large relay lenses. As a result, miniaturization of wearable displays will be possible by taking full advantage of the advancements in micro-technologies; (ii) Provide all the essential 3D depth cues to avoid perceptual errors and viewing discomfort. We need to enable the two eyes to fixate at the correct depth of the objects rather than the display panel without losing resolution. Thereby, eliminating the conflict between the accommodation and convergence. Overcoming these challenges would enable a display which can provide natural looking and interactive 3D and very wide field-of-view (&gt;100deg) in an eyeglasses form factor. Such a display goes far beyond the state-of-the art in wearable displays and open new research directions for intelligent human-computer interfaces and AR.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,525</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Webdam"><Rcn>88843</Rcn><Nid>13078</Nid><HI>Institut National De Recherche En Informatique Et En Automatique, France</HI><Name>Foundations of Web Data Management</Name><PI>Serge Abiteboul</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We propose to develop a formal model for Web data management.

We propose a systematic study of word maps on groups, their images and kernels, as well as related Waring type problems. These include a celebrated conjecture of Thompson, problems regarding covering numbers and mixing times of random walks, as well as probabilistic identities in finite and profinite groups. This is a highly challenging project in which we intend to utilize a wide spectrum of tools, including Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, computational group theory, as well as probabilistic methods and Lie methods.

These FELs based on Linear Accelerator (Linac) technology require radio-protected facilities which are several kilometres in length and also require significant investment (more than a hundred million euros). They have already produced an impressive list of outstanding results in many scientific fields. As a consequence of these successes they are already significantly over-subscribed by the scientific community. The recent progress realized by laser plasma accelerators that can nowadays deliver high quality energetic particle beams in ultra short bunches (of a few femtoseconds) with very high peak currents (of a few kA) are very encouraging for the future. Thanks to the huge longitudinal electric fields they can produce, laser plasma accelerators appear to be a natural candidate to reduce the size and cost of future FELs. Among the many applications laser plasma accelerators sustain, the hope to build a compact Free Electron Laser, has been clearly identified by the scientific community as the near future grand challenge. The goal of the X-five project is then to demonstrate the feasibility of such fifth generation light sources - compact and low cost - that will satisfy the increasing demand of the scientific community. This next generation of FELs will deliver bright X ray beams at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, of interest for the many applications that do not require very high average brightness such as available from  the fourth light sources generation. The laser plasma accelerator research activities of the X-five project will also be of benefit to other fields, including medicine, radiation biology, chemistry, physics and material science, security, and of course accelerator science.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,703,136</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="XCHEM"><Rcn>101410</Rcn><Nid>8958</Nid><HI>Universidad Autonoma De Madrid, Spain</HI><Name>XUV/X-ray lasers for ultrafast electronic control in chemistry</Name><PI>Fernando Martin Garcia</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Advances in generating controlled few-cycle laser pulses and novel ultrashort XUV/Xray sources, from free electron laser (FEL)-based to attosecond high harmonic generation (HHG)-based, have opened completely new avenues for imaging electronic and nuclear dynamics in molecules, with exciting applications in physics, chemistry and biology. Processes such as ionization and dissociation of simple diatomic molecules can now be monitored in real time, but the access to few-femtosecond or attosecond time scales in the XUV/X-ray domain may also allow one to uncover and control the dynamics of elementary chemical processes such as, e.g., ultrafast charge migration, proton transfer, isomerization or multiple ionization, and to address new key questions about the role of attosecond coherent electron dynamics in chemical reactivity. The success of current experimental efforts in explaining these phenomena, present in many biological processes, is seriously limited due to the difficulty in their interpretation. In this respect, the implementation by the applicant&#226;&#128;&#153;s group of nearly exact theoretical methods in supercomputers has made it possible to guide experimental research on simple systems. Such theoretical methods lie outside the traditional quantum chemistry realm since, e.g., they must accurately reproduce the time evolution of the coupled electronic and nuclear motions in the electronic and dissociative continua, including electron correlation and non-adiabatic effects. The necessary extension to systems of chemical interest, the current bottleneck in this field, requires extensive and novel theoretical developments along a similar direction. The aim of this project is to study the electronic and coupled electronic-nuclear dynamics in complex molecules at the attosecond or few-femtosecond time-scales, developing concepts and accurate theoretical tools to interpret the new generation of time-resolved experiments and to achieve ultrafast electronic control in chemistry.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,447,736</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="XLASERS"><Rcn>101439</Rcn><Nid>10475</Nid><HI>Uppsala Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>"X-RAY LASERS, PHOTON SCIENCE, AND STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY"</Name><PI>Janos Hajdu</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Theory predicts that with an ultra-short and very bright coherent X-ray pulse, a single diffraction pattern may be recorded from a large macromolecule, a virus, or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into a plasma. The over-sampled diffraction pattern permits phase retrieval and hence structure determination. The first free-electron lasers (FELs) capable to deliver ultra bright and very short X-ray pulses for such experiments have recently started operations. These are the most brilliant sources of X-rays to date, exceeding the peak brilliance of conventional synchrotrons by a factor of 10 billion. In the duration of a single flash, the beam focused to a micron-sized spot has the same power density as all the sunlight hitting the Earth, focused to a millimetre square. The interaction of an intense X-ray pulse with matter is profoundly different from that of an optical pulse. A necessary goal of the programme is to explore photon-material interactions in strong X-ray fields. Our aim in structural biology is to step beyond conventional damage limits and develop the science and technology required to enable high-resolution studies of single biological objects near the physical limits of imaging. Eligible targets include single virus particles, organelles, cells, nanocrystals, and isolated macromolecules. A particular aim of the planned work is to obtain high-resolution structures for giant viruses. The challenges engage an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon structural sciences, biology, atomic and plasma physics, optics and mathematics. The potential for breakthrough science is great with impact not only in biology or physics but wherever dynamic structural information with high spatial and temporal resolution is valuable.

Three main applications are targeted: localisation phenomena and very complex cracking patterns, precise determination of stresses around contact zones and, finally, introduction in reasonably coarse meshes of the mechanical influence of geometrically small but vitally important reinforcement for the structure safety (weld points,  cables, fillets, &#226;&#128;&#166;). We plan to address them with a unified technology, parts of which are already being incorporated in codes worldwide because of the contribution of the PI and colleagues in the past ten years.

The PI is a specialist in the field of computational mechanics and has been the founder and among the major promoters of the eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM), now widely used for crack growth and material interfaces modelling. With the X-FEM, internal or external mechanical boundaries do not need to be explicitly meshed and may conveniently be stored as level sets.

The project proposes new algorithm based  an original and extended use of the level set concept in conjunction with the X-FEM :

*Thick Level Set (TLS):   We consider that the mechanical variable responsible for the localization of deformation in a softening behaviour (say damage for instance) is not local but tied to the movement of a degradation front located by a level set.
*Inequality Level Set (ILS):  We rephrase variational inequality formulation (such as contact) as shape optimization. The shape of the active contact zone is sought and represented by a level set. For any given level set location, a variational equality is solved and a sensitivity analysis is performed to update the level set location.
*Subgrid  Level Set (SLS):  The structural features (cables, fillets, &#226;&#128;&#166;) are represented on a subgrid different from the mesh used to perform the computation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,957,909</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="XNA"><Rcn>108100</Rcn><Nid>9547</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Development of an artificial information system</Name><PI>Piet Herdewyn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Artificial genetic sequences have become an important tool for the development of new therapeutics but may also define a trait of technological innovation. The possibility to synthesize genes, plasmids and chromosomes combined with the possibilities of directed mutagenesis and genetically reprogramming organisms and directing their evolution will become a crucial issue in synthetic biology. The uniformity of genetic alphabets, the universality of the genetic code, the ubiquity of genetic interchanges and the risks of genetic pollution cannot be overlooked.  On the other hand, synthetic nucleic acids will become more and more important as potential new drugs.
It is proposed to develop an additional type of nucleic acids for the use as information system for the propagation of specific information of non-natural origin. It is the aim of the project to contribute to the development of an artificial genetic system orthogonal to the natural system that can be used as well in synthetic biology as in medicine.
Therefore we have to select &amp; develop the appropriate chemical and enzymatic tools. This means (chemically) the selection of unnatural nucleic acids, their precursors and their modification for uptake in bacteria.

Information on the catalytically active site is notoriously difficult to obtain as it concerns a small minority of states in a sea of other silent states. This silent majority of states obscures the action that takes place on the active states. Because the core hole localizes the final state, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful local probe of the electronic structure and XAS provides detailed information on catalysts under working conditions. A major limitation in the present experiments is the fact that the signal from the majority of non-active sites overwhelms the details from the active sites.

In this proposal I will develop a new idea to solve this problem and allow x-ray spectroscopy  to unveil the nature of active sites. The idea is based on a detailed knowledge of the resonant x-ray emission (RXES) process that allows the detection of RXES spectra that are specific for the active state only. Model calculations predict an enhancement of the active sites over the silent sites of approximately a factor 50, allowing the clear detection of active sites above 1 %  presence.

This method will be suitable to study active sites in heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metal ions. However, the approach is also suitable to study transition metal active sites in homogeneous catalysis and biocatalysis. In addition, the  proposed research will have an impact on first principles x-ray spectroscopy calculations in theoretical chemistry and theoretical physics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="amstat"><Rcn>88924</Rcn><Nid>9311</Nid><HI>The University Of Warwick, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Problems at the Applied Mathematics-Statistics Interface</Name><PI>Andrew Stuart</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Applied mathematics is concerned with developing models with predictive capability, and with probing those models to obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into the phenomena being modelled.

The functionalisation of organic substrates with boryl groups R2B  is based on classical synthetic methods e.g. hydro- and diboration of C-C multiple bonds. Likewise, borylenes B-R should be versatile reagents for corresponding functionalisations, however, the chemistry of such species remained unexplored due to their high instability.
Pioneering work in our laboratories has proven that complexes of the type [LxM=B-R] not only stabilise elusive borylenes B-R in the coordination sphere of various transition metals but, more importantly, serve as unprecedented sources for these species under ambient conditions in condensed phase. Thus, the major objective of the current proposal is to establish novel reactivity patterns based on B-R fragments for the functionalisation of organometallic and organic substrates. Particular attention will be paid to the synthesis of novel molecular and polymeric species with significant potential as materials. Given the pronounced importance of boron containing species in organic synthesis, catalysis and materials science, the proposed project is expected to have a significant impact on these areas of applied molecular science. In addition, a wide range of fundamental aspects will be covered, targeting e.g. novel conjugated cyclic systems or molecules with unprecedented boron-element combinations.

This will be used to detect CP-violating elementary particle interactions that caused our universe to evolve an excess of matter over antimatter  These interactions cause the charge distribution of the electron to be slightly non-spherical and it is this property, the permanent electric dipole moment (EDM), that the ultracold molecules will sense.

Laser cooling of any molecule is very new, with first results emerging from a few laboratories including mine. Developing a fountain of molecules will be a major advance in the state of the art.  As well as being the key to the new EDM instrument, this will be important in its own right because ultracold molecules have major applications in chemistry, quantum information processing and metrology.

In the fountain, the electron spin of each molecule will be polarized. On applying a perpendicular electric field, the spins will precess in proportion to the EDM.  At present the (warm) YbF molecules in my lab precess for only 1ms. This gives us world-leading sensitivity, but has not been sufficient to detect the CP-violating forces being sought. The fountain however will achieve precession times of almost a second, giving over 1000x more rotation.  The increase in sensitivity should reveal a clear EDM, providing information about the fundamental laws of physics, and the important CP-violating physics of the early universe, which is currently not understood.

By advancing the preparation of ultracold molecules, this project will address a key question in particle physics and cosmology: the nature of CP-violating physics beyond the standard model. The approach is radically different from standard accelerator physics and complements it.  The sensitivity is sufficient to detect some proposed new forces that are beyond the reach of any current collider experiment.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,409,629</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="failflow"><Rcn>88933</Rcn><Nid>9191</Nid><HI>Universite De Pau Et Des Pays De L'adour, France</HI><Name>Failure and Fluid Flow in Porous Quasibrittle Materials</Name><PI>Gilles Pijaudier-Cabot</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This project focuses on fluid flow in porous materials with evolving microstructure in the context of civil engineering applications and geomechanics. When the distribution of cracks and the distribution of pore size evolve in concrete and rocks, the influence on the permeability in the case of a single or a multiphase fluid flow needs some in depth investigation. A recent review of state of the art in modelling progressive mechanical breakdown and associated fluid flow in heterogeneous rock shows that little is known on the coupled effects between micro cracking and the intrinsic permeability of a solid phase.  The present project intends to tackle this relationship between mechanical breakdown and associated fluid flow in the context of poromechanics extended to non local modelling. In particular, we will investigate how the internal length which plays a pivotal role at the inception and propagation of material failure may interact with the permeability, what enhanced Darcy-like relationship might be derived in order to apprehend such effects and how to model fluid flow in tight porous materials. The models will be extended to complex and multicomponent systems reproducing as closely as possible the behaviour of real fluids in order to understand and to describe the thermodynamical behaviour due to confinement such as modification of phase transitions and capillary condensation.

Recently, the ALPHA Collaboration at CERN has succeeded in synthesizing and trapping antihydrogen atoms, storing them for up to 1000 s, and performing the first resonant spectroscopy, using microwaves, on trapped antihydrogen.  This last, historic result paves the way for precision microwave and laser spectroscopic measurements using small numbers of trapped antihydrogen atoms.  Because of the breakthroughs made in our collaboration, it is now possible, for the first time, to design antimatter spectroscopic experiments that have achievable milestones of precision. These measurements require a next-generation apparatus, known as ALPHA-2, which is the subject of this proposal.  The items sought are hardware components and radiation sources to help us to test CPT (charge conjugation, parity, time reversal) symmetry invariance by comparing the spectrum of antihydrogen to that of hydrogen.  More generally, we will address the very fundamental question: do matter and antimatter obey the same laws of physics?  The Standard Model says that they must, but mystery continues to cloud our understanding of antimatter - as evidenced by the unexplained  baryon asymmetry in the universe.  ALPHA's experiments offer a unique, high precision, model-independent view into the internal workings of antimatter.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,136,888</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="iCON"><Rcn>111589</Rcn><Nid>10056</Nid><HI>Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands</HI><Name>Integrated Real-time Feedback Control and post-processing for image Restoration</Name><PI>Michel Herman G Verhaegen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>My goal is to develop new computational tools for image restoration by real-time feedback control with full images recorded by a CCD camera. iCON will enable to breakaway from the existing quasi-static Adaptive Optics (AO) or off-line phase diversity approaches. The improvements over these existing image restoration methods are a consequence of three innovative steps taken in this project. The first is the modelling through system identification of the coupled dynamics between the temporal and spatial varying dynamics of the wavefront aberrations that blur the images. New multidimensional distributed Subspace Identification methods will be developed to derive mathematical models that predict the coupled dynamics of the total imaging plant. The use of subspace identification will enable to extract accurate prediction models since no a priori model parameterization is needed, since no use is made of nonlinear parameter optimization and since use can be made of closed-loop data. The accurate predictions are used in the real-time feedback controller to correct the aberrations when they actually occur. The second is the enabled use of the CCD image recording for both identification and real-time control. This sensor provides much more detailed information on the wavefront aberration and the object compared to classically used AO pupil wavefront sensors, e.g. a Shack-Hartmann. The third is the coupling between real-time image restoration and post-processing whereby the real-time feedback provides accurate prior information for the complicated nonlinear optimization in post-processing. The new iCON methodology will enable to consider spatio-temporal feedback on the total imaging plant from the onset of the instrument design cycle. This will lead to finding a better balance between imaging resolution on one hand and size, cost and complexity on the other. Therefore iCON will be a key enabling technology for developing low cost high resolution imaging instruments.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,358</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="iCONNECT"><Rcn>109424</Rcn><Nid>10300</Nid><HI>Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Intracranial COnnection with Neural Networks for Enabling Communication in Total paralysis</Name><PI>Nicolas Franciscus Ramsey</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>iCONNECT aims to give severely paralyzed people the means to communicate by merely imagining to talk or make hand gestures. Imagining specific movements generates spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the brain which I intend to record and decode with an intracranial Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. Many people suffer from partial or full loss of control over their body due to stroke, disease or trauma, and this will increase with population ageing. With both duration and quality of life beyond 60 increasing in the western world, more and more people will suffer from the consequences of function loss (mostly stroke) with the prospect of living for decades with the handicap, and will stand to benefit from restorative technology that has yet to be developed. I believe that functionality can be restored with brain implants. My goal is to develop a BCI that can interpret activity patterns on the surface of the brain in real-time. For this we need to discover how the brain codes for (imagined) actions, how codes can be captured and decoded and how an intracranial BCI system impacts on a user. I will use state of the art techniques (7 Tesla MRI and electrocorticography, ECoG) to explore brain codes and develop decoding strategies. Interactions between user and implanted device will be studied in paralyzed people. I will directly link decoded movements to animated visual feedback of the same body part, expecting to induce a feeling of ownership of the animation, and thereby a sense of actual movement. This research is only possible because of the latest developments in imaging of human brain activity, machine learning techniques, and micro systems technology. My lab is unique in bringing together all these techniques. Success of the project will lead to deeper understanding of how sensorimotor functions are represented in the human brain.

How can we reconcile geochemical observations with geophysical inferences? These are first order unanswered questions despite our steady progress in imaging the Earth's internal structure and understanding the high temperature and pressure properties of minerals. To make a breakthrough, we have to understand solid-state convection in the Earth's mantle in much greater detail. Much is known about the physical processes, such as melting and the delicate interaction between thermal and chemical buoyancy, but the parameters that enter their mathematical description are not very well known. Once these parameters are determined, the thermo-chemical evolution of our planet can self-consistently be modelled. The state-of-the-art is to roughly estimate these parameters and qualitatively compare the modelling to some relevant geophysical, geochemical or geological observations. This comparison is not comprehensive and never explains all observables. We propose a radically new approach, where all observables are used together to infer these parameters directly, using a fully non-linear Bayesian inference technique based on neural networks. This will determine for the first time the initial conditions at the Earth's formation, the Earth-like flow parameters essential to model the thermo-chemical evolution of our planet and produce models that are simultaneously consistent with the main different geophysical and geochemical datasets.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,480,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="iPLASMM"><Rcn>106364</Rcn><Nid>9055</Nid><HI>King's College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Frontiers in nanophotonics: integrated plasmonic metamaterials devices</Name><PI>Anatoly Zayats</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Photonic methamaterials have unique optical properties not available in natural materials. The key question is how to integrate metamaterials within nanophotonics circuitry to harness all the advantages they offer in controlling light on the nanoscale. iPLANET will develop a plasmonic nanorod metamaterial platform for applications covering the entire spectral range from mid-IR through telecom to visible and UV, be CMOS compatible and monolithically integratable in photonic circuitry. Using the unique optical properties of nanorod-based metamaterials, a very high density of photonic states can be achieved, essential for controlling light emission, scattering and nonlinearity in the nanophotonic environment. The project will challenge the frontiers of nanophotonics through the use of these specific to metamaterial properties to achieve integrated nonlinear photonic components with reduced size and energy consumption and integrated bio- and chemical sensors with increased sensitivity, multi-parameter sensing in a broad spectral range, all on the same metamaterial platform. This will be a transformative development for the applications of nanophotonics in optical information processing in integrated photonic circuits and for the realization of integrated sensors for point-of-care devices, security and environmental monitoring.  The success of the project will unlock the potential of metamaterials for the improvement of the real-world photonic devices and provide insight into physical phenomena which are vital for various areas of optical physics and sensing. This will probably be the first demonstration of commercially-viable application of metamaterials.

The crystal growth will employ lithographic processing techniques, made possible by the local expertise in the central clean room facilities of the London Centre for Nanotechnology.  My group is world-leading in developing a method called Coherent X-ray Diffraction (CXD).  Our CXD strain images of a Pb nanocrystal were published in Nature in 2006.  CXD is sensitive to strain because the X-ray diffraction pattern surrounding a Bragg peak can be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric parts.  To a good approximation, the symmetric part can be considered to come from the real part of the electron density, while the antisymmetric part is a projection of the strain field.  The phasing of the data is a critical step that uses a computer algorithm, developed by us, which acts like the lens of a 3D X-ray microscope.  CXD works best for nanocrystal sizes between 40nm and 5&#194;&#181;m, for crystals strongly attached to substrates and for isolated, fiducialised arrays of crystals that can be cross-referenced with other techniques.  To create nanocrystals in this size range, we will use both a bottom-up self-assembly of materials deposited onto  templated substrates, designed to introduce strain, and a top-down  nanosculpture  approach will use lithography techniques to create strain patterns in crystalline materials associated with shapes that are carved into them.   The interpretation of the images is the main intellectual output of the project.  This will be compared with finite element analysis, and the deviations interpreted as unique properties attributable to the nanoscale.  All project participants will work in a design, creation, analysis, interpretation, update cycle that will reveal the new basic principles of nanocrystal structure.  In the long run we will transfer CXD technology to Europe: beamline I-13 at Diamond will be ready for CXD in 2011.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="novcat"><Rcn>93881</Rcn><Nid>9076</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Design of Novel Catalysis by Metal Complexes</Name><PI>David Milstein</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Global concerns regarding the economy, environment and sustainable energy resources dictate an urgent need for the design of novel catalytic reactions. We have recently discovered novel, environmentally benign reactions catalyzed by pincer complexes, including an entirely new reaction, namely the direct coupling of alcohols with amines to produce amides and H2 (Science, 2007, 317, 790). We believe that the mechanisms of these reactions involve a new concept in catalysis: metal-ligand cooperation by aromatization-dearomatization of the ligand. Such cooperation can play key roles also in the activation of H2, C-H, and other bonds. Remarkably, we have very recently discovered a new strategy towards light-induced water splitting into H2 and O2, also based on metal-ligand cooperation in a pincer system, and have observed an unprecedented O-O bond formation process (Science, in press). The design of efficient catalytic systems for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, driven by sunlight, and without use of sacrificial reagents, is among the most important challenges facing science today, underpinning the potential of hydrogen as a clean, sustainable fuel. In this context, it is essential to enhance our understanding of the fundamental chemical steps involved in such processes. We plan to (a) explore the scope of bond activation and catalysis based on the new concept of metal ligand cooperation by aromatization-dearomatization (b) study the mechanism and scope of the newly discovered novel approach towards water splitting by light (c) develop novel environmentally benign catalytic reactions involving O-H, C-H and other bonds, such as anti-Markovnikov hydration of alkenes (d) develop unprecedented asymmetric catalysis using chiral cooperating ligands (e) develop new CO2 chemistry, including its hydrogenation to methanol and photolytic splitting to CO and O2. The research is expected to lead to novel catalysis, of importance to environment and sustainable energy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,912,018</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="regenknee"><Rcn>98409</Rcn><Nid>12901</Nid><HI>University Of Leeds, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Re engineering and regenerating the knee</Name><PI>John Fisher</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), PE8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Over fifteen percent of the western population suffer from osteoarthritis.

The main objective of this proposal is the development of a multiscale simulation technology for the study of DNA, which will cover, with different levels of resolution, but with the same physical roots, the entire range of DNA scales, from nucleobase (&#199;&#186;-scale) to the human genome (m-scale).

Several breakthrough materials, basic concepts and fabrication techniques will be developed based on silicon or going far beyond silicon: At the wafer scale integration level, integration of advanced polymers (optics, conductive polymers, ionic polymer-metal composites) will be studied. These will be applied in several novel subminiature actuator and sensor devices with broad application potential, amongst which microfluidic systems, pressure sensing arrays,
In order to come to complex 3D systems combining modalities as optics, microfluidics, actuators and electronics, advanced device level fabrication and hybrid assembly technologies will be studied as well. Furthermore, the methods for packaging implants (flex/stretch interconnect technology, advanced interposers,&#226;&#128;&#166;) will be pushed far beyond the current state of the art. The adoption of soft, and even
bioresorbable materials for packaging and interconnects will spectacularly improve the human-implant interface.
Another important research line pursued is the study of ultra-low power electronics for medical implants: sensor interfacing, A/D conversion, signal processing, data communication and power transfer.
These fundamental research activities will lead to many applied projects and valorization activities during and long afterwards the end of this grant.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#8216;Dosage Compensation Complex&#8217; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites.

Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#191;parts list&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:

We will analyse the sequences and proteins involved in actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, using structural biology and biochemistry to analyse its control by changes in actin-RPEL domain interactions. We will characterise the dynamics of shuttling, and develop reporters for changes in actin-MAL interaction for analysis of pathway activation in vivo. We will identify genes controlling MAL itself, and the balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools.

However, its functions remain controversial and enigmatic. We suggest that past work on the 5-HT system have been significantly hampered by technical limitations in the selectivity and temporal resolution of the conventional pharmacological and electrophysiological methods that have been applied. We therefore propose to apply novel optogenetic methods that will allow us to overcome these limitations and thereby gain new insight into the biological functions of this important molecule. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that we can deliver exogenous proteins specifically to 5-HT neurons using viral vectors. Our objectives are to (1) record, (2) stimulate and (3) silence the activity of 5-HT neurons with high molecular selectivity and temporal precision by using genetically-encoded sensors, activators and inhibitors of neural function. These tools will allow us to monitor and control the 5-HT system in real-time in freely-behaving animals and thereby to establish causal links between information processing in 5-HT neurons and specific behaviors. In combination with quantitative behavioral assays, we will use this approach to define the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and cognitive functions. The significance of the work is three-fold. First, we will establish a new arsenal of tools for probing the physiological and behavioral functions of 5-HT neurons. Second, we will make definitive tests of major hypotheses of 5-HT function. Third, we will have possible therapeutic applications. In this way, the proposed work has the potential for a major impact in research on the role of 5-HT in brain function and dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,318,636</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ABEL"><Rcn>110276</Rcn><Nid>10233</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure"</Name><PI>Derek Neil Woolfson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.

Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.

What passes the bacterial filter is a relevant sink for carbon on geological time scales, influencing global oxygen and carbon budgets, and fueling the deep subsurface biosphere. Despite the relevance of deep-sea sediment bacteria to climate, geochemical cycles and ecology of the seafloor, their genetic and functional diversity, niche differentiation and biological interactions remain unknown. Our preliminary work in a global survey of deep-sea sediments enables us now to target specific genes for the quantification of abyssal bacteria. We can trace isotope-labeled elements into communities and single cells, and analyze the molecular alteration of organic matter during microbial degradation, all in context with environmental dynamics recorded at the only long-term deep-sea ecosystem observatory in the Arctic that we maintain.

Our study seeks to unveil fundamental principles of co-regulation of genes in a chromo&#194;&#172;somal compartment and the preconditions for homeostasis of such a compartment in the dynamic nuclear environment.
The dosage-compensated X chromosome of male Drosophila flies satisfies the criteria for a functional com&#194;&#172;partment. It is rendered structurally distinct from all other chromosomes by association of a regulatory ribonucleoprotein &#226;&#128;&#152;Dosage Compensation Complex&#226;&#128;&#153; (DCC), enrichment of histone modifications and global decondensation. As a result, most genes on the X chromosome are co-ordinately activated. Autosomal genes inserted into the X acquire X-chromosomal features and are subject to the X-specific regulation.
We seek to uncover the molecular principles that initiate, establish and maintain the dosage-compensated chromosome. We will follow the kinetics of DCC assembly and the timing of association with different types of chromosomal targets in nuclei with high spatial resolution afforded by sub-wavelength microscopy and deep sequencing of DNA binding sites. We will characterise DCC sub-complexes with respect to their roles as kinetic assembly intermediates or as representations of local, functional heterogeneity. We will evaluate the roles of a DCC- novel ubiquitin ligase activity for homeostasis.
Crucial to the recruitment of the DCC and its distribution to target genes are non-coding roX RNAs that are transcribed from the X. We will determine the secondary structure &#226;&#128;&#152;signatures&#226;&#128;&#153; of roX RNAs in vitro and determine the binding sites of the protein subunits in vivo.

Optogenetics and neural imaging combined with the powerful genetics and well-described nervous system of C. elegans offer special opportunities to address these questions. Previously, we identified a series of sensory neurons that modulate aggregation of C. elegans.  These include neurons that respond to O2, CO2, noxious cues, satiety state, and pheromones. We propose to take our analysis to the next level by dissecting how, in mechanistic molecular terms, these distributed inputs modify the activity of populations of interneurons and motoneurons to coordinate group formation.   Our strategy is to develop new, highly parallel approaches to replace the traditional piecemeal analysis.

We propose to:
1) Harness next generation sequencing (NGS) to forward genetics, rapidly to identify a molecular &#194;&#191;parts list&#194;&#191; for aggregation.  Much of the genetics has been done: we have identified almost 200 mutations that inhibit or enhance aggregation but otherwise show no overt phenotype.  A pilot study of 50 of these mutations suggests they identify dozens of genes not previously implicated in aggregation.  NGS will allow us to molecularly identify these genes in a few months, providing multiple entry points to study molecular and circuitry mechanisms for behaviour.
2) Develop new methods to image the activity of populations of neurons in immobilized and freely moving animals, using genetically encoded indicators such as the calcium sensor cameleon and the voltage indicator mermaid.

This will be the first time a complex behaviour has been dissected in this way.

Recent years have seen a revitalised interest in the role of actin in nuclear processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. We will elucidate the molecular basis for the actin-based control of the SRF transcriptional coactivator, MAL. SRF controls transcription through two families of coactivators, the actin-binding MRTFs (MAL, Mkl2), which couple its activity to cytoskeletal dynamics, and the ERK-regulated TCFs (Elk-1, SAP-1, Net). MAL subcellular localisation and transcriptional activity responds to signal-induced changes in G-actin concentration, which are sensed by its actin-binding N-terminal RPEL domain. Members of a second family of RPEL proteins, the Phactrs, also exhibit actin-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The proposal addresses the following novel features of actin biology:
&#194;&#191;	Actin as a transcriptional regulator
&#194;&#191;	Actin as a signalling molecule
&#194;&#191;	Actin-binding proteins as targets for regulation by actin, rather than regulators of actin function

Recent results from my laboratory indicate that these molecules are part of paracrine signaling networks that control important functions in pancreatic islets and adipose tissue through feedback inhibition and feed-forward regulation. These discoveries have open up a new research area with important implications for the understanding of metabolic networks and the treatment of human metabolic syndromes, such as diabetes and obesity.

To drive progress in this new research area beyond the state-of-the-art it is proposed to: i) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Activins regulate Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion in pancreatic &#194;&#178;-cells; ii) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of GDF-3 on adipocyte metabolism, turnover and fat accumulation; iii) Investigate the interplay between insulin levels and fat deposition in the development of insulin resistance using mutant mice lacking Activin B and GDF-3; iv) Investigate tissue-specific contributions of ALK7 and ALK4 signaling to metabolic control by generating and characterizing conditional mutant mice; v) Investigate the effects of specific and reversible inactivation of ALK7 and ALK4 on metabolic regulation using a novel chemical-genetic approach based on analog-sensitive alleles.

The development of drugs capable of enhancing insulin secretion, limiting fat accumulation and ameliorating diet-induced obesity by targeting components of the ALK7 signaling network will find a strong rationale in the results of the proposed work.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,462,154</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AMAIZE"><Rcn>110736</Rcn><Nid>10186</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>Atlas of leaf growth regulatory networks in MAIZE</Name><PI>"Dirk, Gustaaf" Inz&#195;&#169;</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding how organisms regulate size is one of the most fascinating open questions in biology. The aim of the AMAIZE project is to unravel how growth of maize leaves is controlled. Maize leaf development offers great opportunities to study the dynamics of growth regulatory networks, essentially because leaf development is a linear system with cell division at the leaf basis followed by cell expansion and maturation. Furthermore, the growth zone is relatively large allowing easy access of tissues at different positions.  Four different perturbations of maize leaf size will be analyzed with cellular resolution: wild-type and plants having larger leaves (as a consequence of GA20OX1 overexpression), both grown under either well-watered or mild drought conditions. Firstly, a 3D cellular map of the growth zone of the fourth leaf will be made. RNA-SEQ of three different tissues (adaxial- and abaxial epidermis; mesophyll) obtained by laser dissection with an interval of 2.5 mm along the growth zone will allow for the analysis of the transcriptome with high resolution. Additionally, the composition of fifty selected growth regulatory protein complexes and DNA targets of transcription factors will be determined with an interval of 5 mm along the growth zone. Computational methods will be used to construct comprehensive integrative maps of the cellular and molecular processes occurring along the growth zone. Finally, selected regulatory nodes of the growth regulatory networks will be further functionally analyzed using a transactivation system in maize.
AMAIZE opens up new perspectives for the identification of optimal growth regulatory networks that can be selected for by advanced breeding or for which more robust variants (e.g. reduced susceptibility to drought) can be obtained through genetic engineering.

Currently, about 18 million people suffer worldwide from AD. Since no cure is available, this devastating disorder represents one of the most challenging socio-economical problems of our future.  As onset and progression of AD is triggered by the amyloid cascade, I will put particular attention on amyloid &#195;&#159;-peptide (A&#195;&#159;).  The reason for this approach is, that even though 20 years ago the A&#195;&#159; generating processing pathway was identified (Haass et al., Nature 1992a &amp; b), the identity of the A&#195;&#159; species, which initiate the deadly cascade is still unknown.  I will first tackle this challenge by investigating if a novel and so far completely overlooked proteolytic processing pathway is involved in the generation of A&#195;&#159; species capable to initiate spreading of pathology and neurotoxicity. I will then search for modulating proteins, which could affect generation of pathological A&#195;&#159; species. This includes a genome-wide screen for modifiers of gamma-secretase, one of the proteases involved in A&#195;&#159; generation as well as a targeted search for RNA binding proteins capable to posttranscriptionally regulate beta- and alpha-secretase.  In a disease-crossing approach, RNA binding proteins, which were recently found not only to be deposited in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis but also in many AD cases, will be investigated for their potential to modulate A&#195;&#159; aggregation and AD pathology.  Modifiers and novel antibodies specifically recognizing neurotoxic A&#195;&#159; assemblies will be validated for their potential not only to prevent amyloid plaque formation, but also spreading of pathology as well as neurotoxicity.  In vivo validations include studies in innovative zebrafish models, which allow life imaging of neuronal cell death, as well as the establishment of microPET amyloid imaging for longitudinal studies in individual animals.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,020</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AMYTOX"><Rcn>107060</Rcn><Nid>10889</Nid><HI>University Of Leeds, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Amyloid fibril cytotoxicity: new insights from novel approaches</Name><PI>Sheena Radford</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Despite the discovery of amyloidosis more than a century ago, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these devastating human disorders remain obscure. In addition to their involvement in disease, amyloid fibrils perform physiological functions, whilst others have potentials as biomaterials. To realise their use in nanotechnology and to enable the development of amyloid therapies, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular pathways of amyloid assembly and to determine how amyloid fibrils interact with cells and cellular components. The challenges lie in the transient nature and low population of aggregating species and the panoply of amyloid fibril structures. This molecular complexity renders identification of the culprits of amyloid disease impossible to achieve using traditional methods.

Here I propose a series of exciting experiments that aim to cast new light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of amyloidosis by exploiting approaches capable of imaging individual protein molecules or single protein fibrils in vitro and in living cells. The proposal builds on new data from our laboratory that have shown that amyloid fibrils (disease-associated, functional and created from de novo designed sequences) kill cells by a mechanism that depends on fibril length and on cellular uptake. Specifically, I will (i) use single molecule fluorescence and non-covalent mass spectrometry and to determine why short fibril samples disrupt biological membranes more than their longer counterparts and electron tomography to determine, for the first time, the structural properties of cytotoxic fibril ends; (ii) develop single molecule force spectroscopy to probe the interactions between amyloid precursors, fibrils and cellular membranes; and (iii) develop cell biological assays to discover the biological mechanism(s) of amyloid-induced cell death and high resolution imaging and electron tomography to visualise amyloid fibrils in the act of killing living cells."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,465</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ANGIOFAT"><Rcn>94012</Rcn><Nid>9964</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>New mechanisms of angiogenesis modulators in switching between white and brown adipose tissues</Name><PI>Yihai Cao</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying adipose blood vessel growth or regression opens new fundamentally insight into novel therapeutic options for the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. Unlike any other tissues in the body, the adipose tissue constantly experiences expansion and shrinkage throughout the adult life. Adipocytes in the white adipose tissue have the ability to switch into metabolically highly active brown-like adipocytes. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) contains significantly higher numbers of microvessels than white adipose tissue (WAT) in order to adopt the high rates of metabolism. Thus, an angiogenic phenotype has to be switched on during the transition from WAT into BAT. We have found that acclimation of mice in cold could induce transition from inguinal and epidedymal WAT into BAT by upregulation of angiogenic factor expression and down-regulations of angiogenesis inhibitors (Xue et al, Cell Metabolism, 2009). The transition from WAT into BAT is dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that primarily targets on vascular endothelial cells via a tissue hypoxia-independent mechanism. VEGF blockade significantly alters adipose tissue metabolism. In another genetic model, we show similar findings that angiogenesis is crucial to mediate the transition from WAT into BAT (Xue et al, PNAS, 2008). Here we propose that the vascular tone determines the metabolic switch between WAT and BAT. Characterization of these novel angiogenic pathways may reveal new mechanisms underlying development of obesity- and metabolism-related disease complications and may define novel therapeutic targets. Thus, the benefit of this research proposal is enormous and is aimed to treat the most common and highly risk human health conditions in the modern time.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,411,547</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ANGIOMIRS"><Rcn>90075</Rcn><Nid>12849</Nid><HI>Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt Am Main, Germany</HI><Name>microRNAs in vascular homeostasis</Name><PI>Stefanie Dimmeler</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Despite improved therapy, cardiovascular diseases remain the most prevalent diseases in the European Union and the incidence is rising due to increased obesity and ageing. The fine-tuned regulation of vascular functions is essential not only for preventing atherosclerotic diseases, but also after tissue injury, where the coordinated growth and maturation of new blood vessels provides oxygen and nutrient supply. On the other hand, excessive vessel growth or the generation of immature, leaky vessels contributes to pathological angiogenesis. Thus, the regulation of the complex processes governing vessel growth and maturation has broad impacts for several diseases ranging from tumor angiogenesis, diabetic retinopathy, to ischemic cardiovascular diseases. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs, which play a crucial role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. However, only limited information is available regarding the role of miRs in the vasculature. MiRs regulate gene expression by binding to the target mRNA leading either to degradation or to translational repression. Because miRs control patterns of target genes, miRs represent an attractive and promising therapeutic target to interfere with complex processes such as neovascularization and repair of ischemic tissues.  Therefore, the present application aims to identify miRs in the vasculature, which regulate vessel growth and vessel remodelling and may, thus, serve as therapeutic targets in ischemic diseases. Since ageing critically impairs endothelial function, neovascularization and vascular repair, we will specifically identify miRs, which are dysregulated during ageing in endothelial cells and pro-angiogenic progenitor cells, in order to develop novel strategies to rescue age-induced impairment of neovascularization.  Beyond the specific scope of the present application, the principle findings may have impact for other diseases, where deregulated vessel growth causes or accelerates disease states.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,375,394</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ANTS"><Rcn>108314</Rcn><Nid>9513</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Attine ANT SymbiomeS</Name><PI>Jacobus Jan Boomsma</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The attine fungus-growing ants are prime models for understanding phenotypic adaptations in social evolution and symbiosis. The mutualism has many hallmarks of advanced cooperation in its mating system commitments and functional complementarity between multiple symbiont partners, but potential conflicts between sexes and castes over reproductive priorities, and between hosts and symbionts over symbiont mixing have also been documented.  With collaborators at BGI-Shenzhen and the Smithsonian Institution my group has obtained six reference genomes representing all genus-level branches of the higher attine ants and a lower attine outgroup. With collaborators in Denmark and Australia we have pioneered proteomic approaches to understand the preservation of sperm viability in spite of sperm competition and the enzymatic decomposition of plant substrates that the ants use to make their fungus gardens grow.

Here, I propose an integrated study focusing on four major areas of attine ant biology that are particularly inviting for in depth molecular approaches: 1. The protein-level networks that secure life-time (up to 20 years) sperm storage in specialized ant-queen organs and the genetic mechanisms that shape and adjust these &#226;&#128;&#156;sexual symbiome&#226;&#128;&#157; networks. 2. The ant-fungal symbiome, i.e. the dynamics of fungal enzyme production for plant substrate degradation and the redistribution of these enzymes in fungus gardens through fecal deposition after they are ingested but not digested by the ants. 3. The microbial symbiome of ant guts and other tissues with obligate bacterial mutualists, of which we have identified some and will characterize a wider collection across the different branches of the attine ant phylogeny. 4. The genome-wide frequency of genomic imprinting and the significance of these imprints for the expression of caste phenotypes and the regulation of potential reproductive conflicts."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,290,102</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AP-1-Fun"><Rcn>92530</Rcn><Nid>11211</Nid><HI>Fundacion Centro Nacional De Investigaciones Oncologicas Carlos Iii, Spain</HI><Name>AP-1 (Fos/Jun) Functions in Physiology and Disease</Name><PI>Erwin F.

The unresolved issues regarding the AP-1 subunit composition will be tackled biochemically and genetically in various cell types including bone, liver and skin, the primary organs affected by altered AP-1 activity. I plan to utilize the knowledge gained on AP-1 functions in the mouse and transfer it to human disease. The opportunities here lie in exploiting the knowledge of AP-1 target genes and utilizing this information to interfere with pathways involved in normal physiology and disease/cancer. The past investigations revealed that the functions of AP-1 are an essential node at the crossroads between life and death in different cellular systems. I plan to further exploit our findings and concentrate on utilising better mouse models to define these connections. The emphasis will be on identifying molecular signatures and potential treatments in models for cancer, inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Exploring genetically modified stem cell-based therapies in murine and human cells is an ongoing challenge I would like to meet in the forthcoming years at the CNIO. In addition, the mouse models will be used for mechanism-driven therapeutic strategies and these studies will be undertaken in collaboration with the Experimental Therapeutics Division and the service units such as the tumor bank.  The project proposal is divided into 6 Goals (see also Figure 1): Some are a logical continuation based on previous work with completely new aspects (Goal 1-2), some focussing on in depth molecular analyses of disease models with innovative and unconventional concepts, such as for inflammation and cancer, psoriasis and fibrosis (Goal 3-5).

Some distort the bilayer, others change its composition, extract lipids or bridge membranes at distance. Previous works from my laboratory have underlined the importance of membrane sensors, i.e. elements within proteins that help to organize membrane-remodelling events by sensing the physical and chemical state of the underlying membrane. A membrane sensor is not necessarily of well-folded domain that interacts with a specific lipid polar head: some intrinsically unfolded motifs harboring deceptively simple sequences can display remarkable membrane adhesive properties. Among these are some amphipathic helices: the ALPS motif with a polar face made mostly by small uncharged polar residues, the Spo20 helix with several histidines in its polar face and, like a mirror image of the ALPS motif, the alpha-synuclein helix with very small hydrophobic residues. Using biochemistry and molecular dynamics, we will compare the membrane binding properties of these sequences (effect of curvature, charge, lipid unsaturation); using bioinformatics we will look for new motifs, using cell biology we will assess the adaptation of these motifs to the physical and chemical features of organelle membranes. Concurrently, we will use reconstitution approaches on artificial membranes to dissect how membrane sensors contribute to the organization of vesicle tethering by golgins and sterol transport by ORP proteins. We surmise that the combination of a molecular &#194;&#191;switch&#194;&#191;, a small G protein of the Arf family, and of membrane sensors permit to organize these complex reactions in time and in space.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,321</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ARISYS"><Rcn>107706</Rcn><Nid>11243</Nid><HI>Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas, Spain</HI><Name>Engineering an artificial immune system with functional components assembled from prokaryotic parts and modules</Name><PI>V&#195;&#173;ctor De Lorenzo Prieto</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The objective of this project is to overcome current limitations for antibody production that are inherent to the extant immune system of vertebrates.

These modules composed of stand-alone parts and bearing well defined input/output functions, will be assembled in the genomic chassis of streamlined Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida strains. The resulting molecular network will make the ABs expressed and displayed on the cell surface to proceed spontaneously (or at the user's decision) through subsequent cycles of affinity and specificity maturation towards antigens or other targets presented to the bacterial population. In this way, a single, easy-to-handle (albeit heavily engineered) strain will govern all operations that are typically scattered in a multitude of separate methods and apparatuses for AB production."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,422,271</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ATMMACHINE"><Rcn>106896</Rcn><Nid>9495</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>"Structural mechanism of recognition, signaling and resection of DNA double-strand breaks"</Name><PI>Karl-Peter Hopfner</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA double-strand breaks are perhaps the most harmful DNA damages and result in carcinogenic chromosome aberrations. Cells protect their genome by activating a complex signaling and repair network, collectively denoted DNA damage response (DDR). A key initial step of the DDR is the activation of the 360 kDa checkpoint kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) by the multifunctional DSB repair factor Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN). MRN senses and tethers DSBs, processes DSBs for further resection, and recruits and activates ATM to trigger the DDR. A mechanistic basis for the activities of the core DDR sensor MRN has not been established, despite intense research over the past decade. Our recent breakthroughs on structures of core Mre11-Rad50 and Mre11-Nbs1 complexes enable us now address three central questions to finally clarify the mechanism of MRN in the DDR:

- How does MRN interact with DNA or DNA ends in an ATP dependent manner?
- How do MRN and associated factors such as CtIP process blocked DNA ends?
- How do MRN and DNA activate ATM?

We will employ an innovative structural biology hybrid methods approach by combining X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and small angle scattering with crosslink mass spectrometry and combine the structure-oriented techniques with validating in vitro and in vivo functional studies.

IgA autoantibodies reactive with the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are typical of coeliac disease (CD).  These antibodies are only present in subjects who are HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8, and their production is dependent on dietary gluten exposure. This suggests that CD4+ gluten reactive T cells, which are found in CD patients and which recognise gluten peptides deamidated by TG2 in context of DQ2 or DQ8, are implicated in the generation of these autoantibodies. Many small intestinal IgA+ plasma cells express membrane Ig hence allowing isolation of antigen specific cells. Whereas control subjects lack anti-TG2 IgA+ plasma cells, on average 10% of the plasma cells of CD patients are specific for TG2. We have sorted single TG2 reactive IgA+ plasma cells, cloned their VH and VL genes and expressed recombinant mAbs. So far we have expressed 26 TG2 specific mAbs. There is a strong bias for VH5-51 usage, and surprisingly the antibodies are modestly mutated. TG2 acts on specific glutamine residues and can either crosslink these to other proteins (transamidation) or hydrolyse the glutamine to a glutamate (deamidation). None of the 18 mAbs tested affected either transamidation or deamidation leading us to hypothesise that retained crosslinking ability of TG2 when bound to membrane Ig of B cells is an integral part of the anti-TG2 response. Four models of how activation of TG2 specific B cells is facilitated by TG2 crosslinking and the help of gluten reactive CD4 T cells are proposed. These four models will be extensively tested including doing in vivo assays with a newly generated transgenic anti-TG2 immunoglobulin knock-in mouse model."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,291,045</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AXONSURVIVAL"><Rcn>107010</Rcn><Nid>11435</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Axon survival: the role of protein synthesis</Name><PI>Christine Elizabeth Holt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Neurons make long-distance connections with synaptic targets via axons. These axons survive throughout the lifetime of an organism, often many years in mammals, yet how axons are maintained is not fully understood. Recently, we provided in vivo evidence that local mRNA translation in mature axons is required for their maintenance. This new finding, along with in vitro work from other groups, indicates that promoting axonal protein synthesis is a key mechanism by which trophic factors act to prevent axon degeneration. Here we propose a program of research to investigate the importance of ribosomal proteins (RPs) in axon maintenance and degeneration. The rationale for this is fourfold. First, recent genome-wide studies of axonal transcriptomes have revealed that protein synthesis (including RP mRNAs) is the highest functional category in several neuronal types. Second, some RPs have evolved extra-ribosomal functions that include signalling, such as 67LR which acts both as a cell surface receptor for laminin and as a RP. Third, mutations in different RPs in vertebrates cause unexpectedly specific defects, such as the loss of optic axons. Fourth, preliminary results show that RP mRNAs are translated in optic axons in response to trophic factors. Collectively these findings lead us to propose that locally synthesized RPs play a role in axon maintenance through either ribosomal or extra-ribosomal function. To pursue this proposal, we will perform unbiased screens and functional assays using an array of experimental approaches and animal models. By gaining an understanding of how local RP synthesis contributes to axon survival, our studies have the potential to provide novel insights into how components conventionally associated with a housekeeping role (translation) are linked to axon degeneration. Our findings could provide new directions for developing therapeutic tools for neurodegenerative disorders and may have an impact on more diverse areas of biology and disease."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,426,573</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AngioBone"><Rcn>110937</Rcn><Nid>8705</Nid><HI>Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster, Germany</HI><Name>Angiogenic growth, specialization, ageing and regeneration of bone vessels</Name><PI>Ralf Heinrich Adams</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The skeleton and the sinusoidal vasculature form a functional unit with great relevance in health, regeneration, and disease. Currently, fundamental aspects of sinusoidal vessel growth, specialization, arteriovenous organization and the consequences for tissue perfusion, or the changes occurring during ageing remain unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that key principles of bone vascularization and the role of molecular regulators are highly distinct from other organs. I therefore propose to use powerful combination of mouse genetics, fate mapping, transcriptional profiling, computational biology, confocal and two-photon microscopy, micro-CT and PET imaging, biochemistry and cell biology to characterize the growth, differentiation, dynamics, and ageing of the bone vasculature. In addition to established angiogenic pathways, the role of highly promising novel candidate regulators will be investigated in endothelial cells and perivascular osteoprogenitors with sophisticated inducible and cell type-specific genetic methods in the mouse. Complementing these powerful in vivo approaches, 3D co-cultures generated by cell printing technologies will provide insight into the communication between different cell types. The dynamics of sinusoidal vessel growth and regeneration will be monitored by two-photon imaging in the skull. Finally, I will explore the architectural, cellular and molecular changes and the role of capillary endothelial subpopulations in the sinusoidal vasculature of ageing and osteoporotic mice.

Although the importance of these channels has been recognized for more than 30 years their molecular identity remained obscure. The recent discovery of two protein families encoding for CaCCs, Anoctamins and Bestrophins, was a scientific breakthrough that has provided first insight into two novel ion channel architectures. Within this proposal we aim to determine the first high resolution structures of members of both families and study their functional behavior by an interdisciplinary approach combining biochemistry, X-ray crystallography and electrophysiology. The structural investigation of eukaryotic membrane proteins is extremely challenging and will require us to investigate large numbers of candidates to single out family members with superior biochemical properties. During the last year we have made large progress in this direction. By screening numerous eukaryotic Anoctamins and prokaryotic Bestrophins we have identified well-behaved proteins for both families, which were successfully scaled-up and purified. Additional family members will be identified within the course of the project. For these stable proteins we plan to grow crystals diffracting to high resolution and to proceed with structure determination. With first structural information in hand we will perform detailed functional studies using electrophysiology and complementary biophysical techniques to gain mechanistic insight into ion permeation and gating. As the pharmacology of both families is still in its infancy we will in later stages also engage in the identification and characterization of inhibitors and activators of Anoctamins and Bestrophins to open up a field that may ultimately lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies targeting calcium-activated chloride channels.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,176,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AnoPath"><Rcn>107367</Rcn><Nid>11360</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Genetics of mosquito resistance to pathogens</Name><PI>Kenneth Du Souchet Vernick</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Malaria parasite infection in humans has been called &#226;&#128;&#156;the strongest known force for evolutionary selection in the recent history of the human genome&#226;&#128;&#157;, and I hypothesize that a similar statement may apply to the mosquito vector, which is the definitive host of the malaria parasite.  We previously discovered efficient malaria-resistance mechanisms in natural populations of the African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae.  Aim 1 of the proposed project will implement a novel genetic mapping design to systematically survey the mosquito population for common and rare genetic variants of strong effect against the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.  A product of the mapping design will be living mosquito families carrying the resistance loci.  Aim 2 will use the segregating families to functionally dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms controlled by the loci, including determination of the pathogen specificity spectra of the host-defense traits.  Aim 3 targets arbovirus transmission, where Anopheles mosquitoes transmit human malaria but not arboviruses such as Dengue and Chikungunya, even though the two mosquitoes bite the same people and are exposed to the same pathogens, often in malaria-arbovirus co-infections.  We will use deep-sequencing to detect processing of the arbovirus dsRNA intermediates of replication produced by the RNAi pathway of the mosquitoes. The results will reveal important new information about differences in the efficiency and quality of the RNAi response between mosquitoes, which is likely to underlie at least part of the host specificity of arbovirus transmission.  The 3 Aims will make significant contributions to understanding malaria and arbovirus transmission, major global public health problems, will aid the development of a next generation of vector surveillance and control tools, and will produce a definitive description of the major genetic factors influencing host-pathogen interactions in mosquito immunity.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,307,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Anti-Virome"><Rcn>108059</Rcn><Nid>9419</Nid><HI>Universitaet Ulm, Germany</HI><Name>A combined evolutionary and proteomics approach to the discovery, induction and application of antiviral immunity factors</Name><PI>Frank Kirchhoff</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Humans are equipped with a variety of intrinsic immunity or host restriction factors. These evolved under positive selection pressure for diversification and represent a first line of defence against invading viruses. Unfortunately, however, many pathogens have evolved effective antagonists against our defences. For example, the capability of HIV-1 to counteract human restriction factors that interfere with reverse transcription, uncoating and virion release has been a prerequisite for the global spread of AIDS. We are just beginning to understand the diversity and induction of antiretroviral factors and how pandemic HIV-1 group M (major) strains evolved to counteract all of them. Here, I propose to use a genetics, proteomics and evolutionary approach to discover and define as-yet-unknown antiviral effectors and their inducers. To identify novel antiviral factors, we will examine the capability of all primate genes that are under strong positive selection pressure to inhibit HIV and its simian (SIV) precursors. This examination from the evolutionary perspective of the invading pathogen will also reveal which adaptations allowed HIV-1 to cause the AIDS pandemic. Furthermore, complex peptide-protein libraries representing essentially the entire human peptidome, will be utilized to identify novel specific inducers of antiviral restriction factors. My ultimate aim is to unravel the network of inducers and effectors of antiviral immunity - the ""Anti-Virome"" - and to use this knowledge to develop novel effective preventive and therapeutic approaches based on the induction of combinations of antiviral factors targeting different steps of the viral life cycle. The results of this innovative and interdisciplinary program will provide fundamental new insights into intrinsic immunity and may offer alternatives to conventional vaccine and therapeutic approaches because most restriction factors have broad antiviral activity and are thus effective against various pathogens."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,915,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Antivessel-T-Cells"><Rcn>109639</Rcn><Nid>9870</Nid><HI>Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Switzerland</HI><Name>Development of Vascular-Disrupting Lymphocyte Therapy for Tumours</Name><PI>Georgios Coukos</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>T cell engineering with chimeric antigen receptors has opened the door to effective immunotherapy. CARs are fusion genes encoding receptors whose extracellular domain comprises a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody that binds to a tumour surface epitope, while the intracellular domain comprises the signalling module of CD3&#206;&#182; along with powerful costimulatory domains (e.g. CD28 and/or 4-1BB). CARs are a major breakthrough, since they allow bypassing HLA restrictions or loss, and they can incorporate potent costimulatory signals tailored to optimize T cell function. However, solid tumours present challenges, since they are often genetically unstable, and the tumour microenvironment impedes T cell function. The tumour vasculature is a much more stable and accessible target, and its disruption has catastrophic consequences for tumours. Nevertheless, the lack of affinity reagents has impeded progress in this area. The objectives of this proposal are to develop the first potent and safe tumour vascular-disrupting tumour immunotherapy using scFv&#226;&#128;&#153;s and CARs uniquely available in my laboratory.
I propose to use these innovative CARs to understand for the first time the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between anti-vascular CAR-T cells and tumour endothelium, and exploit them to maximize tumour vascular destruction. I also intend to employ innovative engineering approaches to minimize the chance of reactivity against normal vasculature. Lastly, I propose to manipulate the tumour damage mechanisms ensuing anti-vascular therapy, to maximize tumour rejection through immunomodulation. We are poised to elucidate critical interactions between tumour endothelium and anti-vascular T cells, and bring to bear cancer therapy of unparalleled power. The impact of this work could be transforming, given the applicability of tumour-vascular disruption across most common tumour types.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ArchAdapt"><Rcn>102542</Rcn><Nid>10573</Nid><HI>Veterinaermedizinische Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>The architecture of adaptation to novel environments</Name><PI>Christian Werner Schl&#195;&#182;tterer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the central goals in evolutionary biology is to understand adaptation. Experimental evolution represents a highly promising approach to study adaptation. In this proposal, a freshly collected D. simulans population will be allowed to adapt to laboratory conditions under two different temperature regimes: hot (27&#194;&#176;C) and cold (18&#194;&#176;C). The trajectories of adaptation to these novel environments will be monitored on three levels: 1) genomic, 2) transcriptomic, 3) phenotypic. Allele frequency changes during the experiment will be measured by next generation sequencing of DNA pools (Pool-Seq) to identify targets of selection. RNA-Seq will be used to trace adaptation on the transcriptomic level during three developmental stages. Eight different phenotypes will be scored to measure the phenotypic consequences of adaptation. Combining the adaptive trajectories on these three levels will provide a picture of adaptation for a multicellular, outcrossing organism that is far more detailed than any previous results.
Furthermore, the proposal addresses the question of how adaptation on these three levels is reversible if the environment reverts to ancestral conditions. The third aspect of adaptation covered in the proposal is the question of repeatability of adaptation. Again, this question will be addressed on the three levels: genomic, transcriptomic and phenotypic. Using replicates with different degrees of genetic similarity, as well as closely related species, we will test how similar the adaptive response is.
This large-scale study will provide new insights into the importance of standing variation for the adaptation to novel environments. Hence, apart from providing significant evolutionary insights on the trajectories of adaptation, the results we will obtain will have important implications for conservation genetics and commercial breeding.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,452,084</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AsthmaVir"><Rcn>185446</Rcn><Nid>11978</Nid><HI>Academisch Medisch Centrum Bij De Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>The roles of innate lymphoid cells and rhinovirus in asthma exacerbations</Name><PI>Hergen Spits</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Asthma exacerbations represent a high unmet medical need in particular in young children. Human Rhinoviruses (HRV) are the main triggers of these exacerbations. Till now Th2 cells were considered the main initiating effector cell type in asthma in general and asthma exacerbations in particular. However, exaggerated Th2 cell activities alone do not explain all aspects of asthma and exacerbations. Building on our recent discovery of type 2 human innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) capable of promptly producing high amounts of IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 upon activation and on mouse data pointing to an essential role of these cells in asthma and asthma exacerbations, ILC2 may be the main initiating cells in asthma exacerbations in humans. Thus we hypothesize that HRV directly or indirectly stimulate ILC2s to produce cytokines driving the effector functions leading to the end organ effects that characterize this debilitating disease. Targeting ILC2 and HRV in parallel will provide a highly attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of asthma exacerbations. In depth study of the mechanisms of ILC2 differentiation and function will lead to the design effective drugs targeting these cells; thus the first two objectives of this project are: 1) To unravel the lineage relationship of ILC populations and to decipher the signal transduction pathways that regulate the function of ILCs, 2) to test the functions of lung-residing human ILCs and the effects of compounds that affect these functions in mice which harbour a human immune system and human lung epithelium under homeostatic conditions and after infections with respiratory viruses. The third objective of this project is developing reagents that target HRV; to this end we will develop broadly reacting highly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that can be used for prophylaxis and therapy of patients at high risk for developing severe asthma exacerbations.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,593</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Atheroprotect"><Rcn>94216</Rcn><Nid>12287</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Structure-Function Analysis of the Chemokine Interactome for Therapeutic Targeting and Imaging in Atherosclerosis</Name><PI>Christian Weber</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Atherosclerosis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the arterial wall. Mononuclear cell recruitment is driven by chemokines that can be deposited e.g. by activated platelets on inflamed endothelium. Chemokines require oligomerization and immobilization for efficient function, and recent evidence supports the notion that heterodimer formation between chemokines constitutes a new regulatory principle amplifying specific chemokine activities while suppressing others. Although crucial to inflammatory disease, this has been difficult to prove in vivo, primarily as chemokine heterodimers exist in equilibrium with their homodimer counterparts. We introduce the paradigm that heteromerization of chemokines provides the combinatorial diversity for functional plasticity and fine-tuning, coining this interactome. Given the relevance of chemokine heteromers in vivo, we aim to exploit this in an anti-inflammatory approach to selectively target vascular disease. In a multidisciplinary project, we plan to generate covalently-linked heterodimers to establish their biological significance. Obligate heterodimers of CC and CXC chemokines will be designed using computer-assisted modeling, chemically synthesized and cross-linked, structurally assessed using NMR spectroscopy and crystallography, and subjected to functional characterization in vitro and reconstitution in vivo. Conversely, we will develop cyclic beta-sheet-based peptides binding chemokines to specifically disrupt heteromers and we will generate mice with conditional deletion or knock-in of chemokine mutants with defects in heteromerization or proteoglycan binding to be analyzed in models of atherosclerosis. Peptides will be used for molecular imaging and chemokine heteromers will be quantified in cardiovascular patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="AxoGLIA"><Rcn>98549</Rcn><Nid>13052</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>The role of myelinating glia in preserving axon function</Name><PI>Klaus-Armin Nave</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In the human brain, the 'bottleneck' of neuronal integrity are long axonal projections, which are often the first to degenerate in neuro-psychiatric diseases. We have discovered in mice that oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are not only essential for the formation of myelin, but also for the functional integrity of axons and their long-term survival. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained obscure. We propose to use experimental mouse genetics to study neuron-glia interactions and to identify axonal signals that control the normal behaviour of myelinating oligodendrocytes. We will then test our hypothesis that axons require oligodendrocytes not only for myelination, but also for the metabolic support of impulse propagation and fast axonal transport. Based on striking pilot observations, we will analyze the mechanisms by which ensheathing glial cells respond to axonal distress and ask in vivo whether they provide glycolysis end products to axonal mitochondria for energy production ('lactate shuttle'). We will also investigate whether myelin lipids are a readily accessible energy store in glia and explore a speculative hypothesis that N-acetyl aspartate is an aspartate-based shuttle of acetyl-CoA residues. If this proposal is successful, we will begin to understand the true function of oligodendrocytes in endogenous neuroprotection and as bystanders of neuronal disease and normal brain aging. This would initiate a paradigm shift for the role of myelinating glial cells, and could open the door for novel therapeutic strategies in a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases, which pose a major burden on the EC health care system.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,477,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="B-INNATE"><Rcn>103199</Rcn><Nid>8961</Nid><HI>Fundaci&#195;&#179; Institut Mar D&#226;&#128;&#153;Investigacions M&#195;&#168;diques (Imim), Spain</HI><Name>Innate signaling networks in B cell antibody production: new targets for vaccine development</Name><PI>Andrea Cerutti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The long-term goal of this proposal is to explore a novel immune pathway that involves an unexpected interplay between marginal zone (MZ) B cells and neutrophils. MZ B cells are strategically positioned at the interface between the immune system and the circulation and rapidly produce protective antibodies to blood-borne pathogens through a T cell-independent pathway that remains poorly understood. We recently found that the human spleen contains a novel subset of B cell helper neutrophils (NBH cells) with a phenotype and gene expression profile distinct from those of conventional circulating neutrophils (NC cells). In this proposal, we hypothesize that NC cells undergo splenic reprogramming into NBH cells through an IL-10-dependent pathway involving perifollicular sinusoidal endothelial cells. We contend that these unique endothelial cells release NC cell-attracting chemokines and IL-10 upon sensing blood-borne bacteria through Toll-like receptors. We also argue that IL-10 from sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulates NC cells to differentiate into NBH cells equipped with powerful MZ B cell-stimulating activity. The following three aims will be pursued. Aim 1 is to determine the mechanisms by which splenic sinusoidal endothelial cells induce reprogramming of NC cells into NBH cells upon sensing bacteria through Toll-like receptors. Aim 2 is to elucidate the mechanisms by which NBH cells induce IgM production, IgG and IgA class switching, and plasma cell differentiation in MZ B cells. Aim 3 is to evaluate the mechanisms by which NBH cells induce V(D)J gene somatic hypermutation and high-affinity antibody production in MZ B cells. These studies will uncover previously unknown facets of the immunological function of neutrophils by taking advantage of unique cells and tissues from patients with rare primary immunodeficiencies and by making use of selected mouse models. Results from these studies may also lead to the identification of novel vaccine strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,214,035</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BACNK"><Rcn>107048</Rcn><Nid>12177</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Recognition of bacteria by NK cells</Name><PI>Ofer Mandelboim</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>NK cells that are well known by their ability to recognize and eliminate virus infected and tumor cells were also implicated in the defence against bacteria.

In the current proposal we aimed at determining the &#226;&#128;&#156;NK cell receptor-bacterial interactome&#226;&#128;&#157;. We will examine the hypothesis that NK inhibitory and activating receptors are directly involved in bacterial recognition. This ground breaking hypothesis is based on our preliminary results in which we show that several NK cell receptors directly recognize various bacterial strains as well as on a few other publications. We will generate various mice knockouts for NCR1 (a major NK killer receptor) and determine their microbiota to understand the physiological function of NCR1 and whether certain bacterial strains affects its activity. We will use different human and mouse NK killer and inhibitory receptors fused to IgG1 to pull-down bacteria from saliva and fecal samples and then use 16S rRNA analysis and next generation sequencing to determine the nature of the bacteria species isolated. We will identify the bacterial ligands that are recognized by the relevant NK cell receptors, using bacterial random transposon insertion mutagenesis approach. We will end this research with functional assays.

This extraordinary feature facilitates their survival when facing extreme environments. Utilizing Bacillus subtilis as our primary model organism, we propose to study two facets of this vital bacterial attribute: communication via extracellular nanotubes, and persistence as resilient spores while maintaining the potential to revive. Exploring these fascinating aspects of bacterial physiology is likely to change our view as to how bacteria sense, respond, endure and communicate with their extracellular environment.
We have recently discovered a previously uncharacterized mode of bacterial communication, mediated by tubular extensions (nanotubes) that bridge neighboring cells, providing a route for exchange of intracellular molecules. Nanotube-mediated molecular sharing may represent a key form of bacterial communication in nature, allowing for the emergence of new phenotypes and increasing survival in fluctuating environments. Here we propose to develop strategies for observing nanotube formation and molecular exchange in living bacterial cells, and to characterize the molecular composition of nanotubes. We will explore the premise that nanotubes serve as a strategy to expand the cell surface, and will determine whether nanotubes provide a conduit for phage infection and spreading. Furthermore, the formation and functionality of interspecies nanotubes will be explored. An additional mode employed by bacteria to achieve extreme robustness is the ability to reside as long lasting spores. Previously held views considered the spore to be dormant and metabolically inert. However, we have recently shown that at least one week following spore formation, during an adaptive period, the spore senses and responds to environmental cues and undergoes corresponding molecular changes, influencing subsequent emergence from quiescence.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,497,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BARCODE"><Rcn>191139</Rcn><Nid>10583</Nid><HI>Institute Of Cancer Research - Royal Cancer Hospital, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The use of genetic profiling to guide prostate cancer targeted screening and cancer care</Name><PI>Rosalind Anne Eeles</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Prostate cancer is the commonest solid cancer in men in the European Community.

This proposal, BARCODE, aims to be ground-breaking in this area. BARCODE has two components (1) to profile a population in England using the current 77 genetic variant profile and compare screening outcomes with those from population based screening studies to determine if genetics can target screening more effectively in this disease by identifying prostate cancer that more often needs treatment  and (2) genetically profiling men with prostate cancer in the uro-oncology clinic for a panel of genes which predict for worse outcome so that these men can be offered more intensive staging and  treatment within clinical trials.

The ambition is to take discoveries all the way from phenotypic characterization to the identification of the genes and the actual genetic variant causing a phenotypic effect and to understanding the underlying functional mechanisms. The program will involve a fish (the Atlantic herring), a bird (the domestic chicken) and a mammal (the European rabbit). The Atlantic herring will be studied because it provides unique opportunities to study the genetics of adaptation in a natural population and because of the possibilities to revolutionize the fishery management of this economically important marine fish. We will generate a draft assembly of the herring genome and then perform whole genome resequencing of different populations to reveal the population structure and the loci underlying genetic adaptation. The European rabbit is an excellent model for studying the genetics of speciation due to the presence of two distinct subspecies on the Iberian Peninsula. The domestication of the rabbit is also particularly interesting because it is a recent event (about 1500 years ago) and it is well established that domestication happened from the wild rabbit population in southern France. Finally, the domestic chicken provides excellent opportunities for in depth functional studies since it is both a domestic animal harbouring a rich genetic diversity and an experimental organism.

The brain vasculature possesses several unique features collectively named the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in which passive permeability is almost completely abolished and replaced by a complex of specific transport mechanisms. The BBB is necessary to uphold the specific milieu necessary for neuronal function. Whereas breakdown of the BBB is part of many CNS diseases, including stroke, neuroinflammation, trauma and neurodegenerative disorders, its molecular mechanisms and consequences are unclear and debated. Conversely, the intact BBB is a huge obstacle for drug delivery to the brain. Research on the BBB therefore has two seemingly opposing aims: 1) to seal a damaged BBB and protect the brain from toxic blood products, and 2) to open the BBB &#226;&#128;&#156;on demand&#226;&#128;&#157; for drug delivery. A major problem in the BBB field has been the lack of in vivo animal models for molecular and functional studies. So far, available in vitro models are not recapitulating the in vivo BBB. Our recent work on mouse models lacking pericytes, a BBB-associated cell type, demonstrates a specific role for pericytes in the development and regulation of the mammalian BBB. These animal models are the first ones showing a general and significant BBB impairment in adulthood, and as such they provide a unique opportunity to address molecular mechanisms of BBB disruption in disease and in drug transport across the BBB. Importantly, the new models and tools that we have developed allow us to search for relevant druggable mechanisms and molecular targets in the BBB. The long-term goals of this proposal are to develop molecular strategies and tools to open and close the BBB &#226;&#128;&#156;on demand&#226;&#128;&#157; for drug delivery to the CNS, and to explore the importance and mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and stroke."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,427</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BEEHIVE"><Rcn>185401</Rcn><Nid>11975</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Bridging the Evolution and Epidemiology of HIV in Europe</Name><PI>Christopher Fraser</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of the BEEHIVE project is to generate novel insight into HIV biology, evolution and epidemiology, leveraging next-generation high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to produce and analyse whole-genomes of viruses from approximately 3,000 European HIV-1 infected patients.

The primary objective is to discover the viral genetic determinants of severity of infection and set-point viral load. This primary objective is high-risk &amp; blue-skies: there is ample indirect evidence of polymorphisms that alter virulence, but they have never been identified, and it is not known how easy they are to discover.

The project also includes secondary and tertiary objectives that address critical open questions in HIV epidemiology and evolution. The secondary objective is to use viral genetic sequences allied to mathematical epidemic models to better understand the resurgent European epidemic amongst high-risk groups, especially men who have sex with men. The aim will not just be to establish who is at risk of infection, which is known from conventional epidemiological approaches, but also to characterise the risk factors for onwards transmission of the virus. Tertiary objectives involve understanding the relationship between the genetic diversity within viral samples, indicative of on-going evolution or dual infections, to clinical outcomes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,739</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BIOFORCE"><Rcn>90202</Rcn><Nid>9648</Nid><HI>Universidad De Lleida, Spain</HI><Name>Simultaneous multi-pathway engineering in crop plants through combinatorial genetic transformation: Creating nutritionally biofortified cereal grains for food security</Name><PI>Paul Christou</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"BIOFORCE has a highly ambitious applied objective: to create transgenic cereal plants that will provide a near-complete micronutrient complement (vitamins A, C, E, folate and essential minerals Ca, Fe, Se and Zn) for malnourished people in the developing world, as well as built-in resistance to insects and parasitic weeds. This in itself represents a striking advance over current efforts to address food insecurity using applied biotechnology in the developing world. We will also address fundamental mechanistic aspects of multi-gene/pathway engineering through transcriptome and metabolome profiling. Fundamental science and applied objectives will be achieved through the application of an exciting novel technology (combinatorial genetic transformation) developed and patented by my research group. This allows the simultaneous transfer of an unlimited number of transgenes into plants followed by library-based selection of plants with appropriate genotypes and phenotypes. All transgenes integrate into one locus ensuring expression stability over multiple generations. This proposal represents a new line of research in my laboratory, founded on incremental advances in the elucidation of transgene integration mechanisms in plants over the past two and a half decades. In addition to scientific issues, BIOFORCE address challenges such as intellectual property, regulatory and biosafety issues and crucially how the fruits of our work will be taken up through philanthropic initiatives in the developing world while creating exploitable opportunities elsewhere.

However, only one group of animals has the necessary genetic/enzymatic toolkit to control biomineralization: siliceous sponges (Porifera). Based on his pioneering discoveries in poriferan molecular biology and physiological chemistry, the PI has brought biosilicification into the focus of basic and applied research. Through multiple trendsetting approaches the molecular key components for the enzymatic synthesis of polymorphic siliceous skeletal elements in sponges have been elucidated and characterized. Subsequently, they have been employed to synthesize innovative composite materials in vitro. Nonetheless, knowledge of the functional mechanisms involved remains sketchy and harnessing biosilicification, beyond the in vitro synthesis of amorphous nanocomposites, is still impossible. Using a unique blend of cutting-edge techniques in molecular/structural biology, biochemistry, bioengineering, and material sciences, the PI approaches for the first time a comprehensive analysis of natural biomineralization, from gene to biomineral to hierarchically ordered structures of increasing complexity. The groundbreaking discoveries expected will be of extreme importance for understanding poriferan biosilicification.

Nuclear transcription complexes function as large multiprotein assemblies and are often composed of functional modules. The regulated decision-making that exists in cells governing the assembly and the allocation of factors to different transcription complexes to regulate distinct gene expression pathways is not yet understood. To tackle this fundamental question, we will systematically analyse the regulated biogenesis of transcription complexes from their sites of translation in the cytoplasm, through their assembly intermediates and nuclear import, to their site of action in the nucleus. The project will have four main Aims to decipher the biogenesis of transcription complexes:
I) Investigate their co-translation-driven assembly
II) Determine their cytoplasmic intermediates and factors required for their assembly pathways
III) Uncover their nuclear import
IV) Understand at the single molecule level their nuclear assembly, dynamics and action at target genes
To carry out these aims we propose a combination of multidisciplinary and cutting edge approaches, out of which some of them will be high-risk taking, while others will utilize methods routinely run by the group. The project builds on several complementary expertise and knowledge either already existing in the group or that will be implemented during the project. At the end of the proposed project we will obtain novel results extensively describing the different steps of the regulatory mechanisms that control the assembly and the consequent gene regulatory function of transcription complexes.

A striking feature of this tissue is its segmental organization and we have made major contributions to the understanding of the molecular control of the segmentation process. We identified a molecular oscillator associated to the rhythmic production of somites and proposed a model for vertebrate segmentation based on the integration of a rhythmic signaling pulse gated spatially by a system of traveling FGF and Wnt signaling gradients. We are also studying the differentiation of paraxial mesoderm precursors into the muscle, cartilage and dermis lineages. Our work identified the Wnt, FGF and Notch pathways as playing a prominent role in the patterning and differentiation of paraxial mesoderm. In this application, we largely focus on the molecular control of paraxial mesoderm development. Using microarray and high throughput sequencing-based approaches and bioinformatics, we will characterize the transcriptional network acting downstream of Wnt, FGF and Notch in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). We will also use genetic and pharmacological approaches utilizing real-time imaging reporters to characterize the pacemaker of the segmentation clock in vivo, and also in vitro using differentiated embryonic stem cells. We further propose to characterize in detail a novel RA-dependent pathway that we identified and which controls the somite left-right symmetry. Our work is expected to have a strong impact in the field of congenital spine anomalies, currently an understudied biomedical problem, and will be of utility in elucidating the etiology and eventual prevention of these disorders.

The fossil record illuminates this evolutionary history more directly than inferences from the diversity of living forms, but the fossils usually consist only of bones whereas many of the most important and interesting changes occurred in the soft anatomy. Traditional approaches to reconstructing the musculature and other soft tissues of fossil vertebrates rely on subjective tools, like the visual identification of rough bone textures thought to indicate muscle attachments, and generally leave a lot to be desired. Here I propose a wholly novel and radically more objective approach to the identification of soft-tissue contacts, using holotomographic synchrotron CT at sub-micron resolutions to identify these contacts by the three-dimensional micro-architecture of the bone. A pilot study has already shown that such scans (performed at the ESRF synchrotron facility in Grenoble) are capable of imaging key features such as arrested growth surfaces and probable Sharpey s fibres in 380 million year old fossils. We will undertake a systematic review of the three-dimensional bone micro-architectures associated with different soft-tissue contacts in living vertebrates, and the use this as a key to reconstruct the soft-tissue contacts on fossil bones with unprecedented accuracy. This will permit us to produce far more reliable reconstructions of the soft anatomy than has hitherto been possible. Our findings will inform other areas of palaentology, particularly functional morphology, and will also be of great importance to evolutionary developmental biology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,046,782</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BRAINEVODEVO"><Rcn>102353</Rcn><Nid>12540</Nid><HI>European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany</HI><Name>A Neuron Type Atlas of the Annelid Brain: Development and Evolution of Chemosensory-Motor Circuits</Name><PI>Detlev Arendt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Neural circuits, composed of interconnected neurons, represent the basic unit of the nervous system. One way to understand the highly complex arrangement of cross-talking, serial and parallel circuits is to resolve its developmental and evolutionary emergence. The rationale of the research proposal presented here is to elucidate the complex circuitry of the vertebrate and insect forebrain by comparison to the much simpler and evolutionary ancient &#226;&#128;&#156;connectome&#226;&#128;&#157; of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We will build a unique resource, the Platynereis Neuron Type Atlas, combining, for the first time, neuronal morphologies, axonal projections, cellular expression profiling and developmental lineage for an entire bilaterian brain. We will focus on five days old larvae when most adult neuron types are already present in small number and large part of the axonal scaffold in place.
Building on the Neuron Type Atlas, the second part of the proposal envisages the functional dissection of the Platynereis chemosensory-motor forebrain circuits. A newly developed microfluidics behavioural assay system, together with a cell-based GPCR screening will identify partaking neurons. Zinc finger nuclease-mediated knockout of circuit-specific transcription factors as identified from the Atlas will reveal circuit-specific gene regulatory networks, downstream effector genes and functional characteristics. Laser ablation of GFP-labeled single neurons and axonal connections will yield further insight into the function of circuit components and subcircuits.

Ultrafine particles (UFP) translocate to the brains of experimental animals resulting in local proinflammatory overexpression. As the basic elements for thinking are acquired by developing brains during infancy and childhood, susceptibility may be elevated in early life.

We postulate that traffic-related air pollution (particularly UFPs and metals/hydrocarbons content) impairs neurodevelopment in part via effects on frontal lobe maturation, likely increasing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). BREATHE objectives are to develop valid methods to measure children's personal UFP exposure and to develop valid neuroimaging methods to assess correlations between neurobehavior, neurostructural alterations and particle deposition in order to reveal how traffic pollution affects children&#194;&#191;s exposure to key contaminants and brain development, and identify susceptible subgroups.

We have conducted general population birth cohort studies providing preliminary evidence of residential air pollution effects on prenatal growth and mental development.

We aim to demonstrate short and long-term effects on neurodevelopment using innovative epidemiological methods interfaced with environmental chemistry and neuroimaging following 4000 children from 40 schools with contrasting high/low traffic exposure in six linked components involving: repeated psychometric tests, UFP exposure assessment using personal, school and home measurements, gene-environment interactions on inflammation, detoxification pathways and ADHD genome-wide-associated genes, neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy) in ADHD/non-ADHD children, integrative causal modeling using mathematics, and replication in 2900 children with neurodevelopment followed from pregnancy.

During this process, a polarized mother cell divides into non-equivalent daughters. These may differentially inherit fate determinants, irreparable damages or age determinants. Our aim is to decipher the mechanisms governing the individualization of daughters from each other. In the past ten years, our studies identified several lateral diffusion barriers located in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum of budding yeast. These barriers all restrict molecular exchanges between the mother cell and its bud, and thereby compartmentalize the cell already long before its division. They play key roles in the asymmetric segregation of various factors. On one side, they help maintain polarized factors into the bud. Thereby, they reinforce cell polarity and sequester daughter-specific fate determinants into the bud. On the other side they prevent aging factors of the mother from entering the bud. Hence, they play key roles in the rejuvenation of the bud, in the aging of the mother, and in the differentiation of mother and daughter from each other. Recently, we accumulated evidence that some of these barriers are subject to regulation, such as to help modulate the longevity of the mother cell in response to environmental signals. Our data also suggest that barriers help the mother cell keep traces of its life history, thereby contributing to its individuation and adaption to the environment. In this project, we will address the following questions: 1 How are these barriers assembled, functioning, and regulated? 2 What type of differentiation processes are they involved in? 3 Are they conserved in other eukaryotes, and what are their functions outside of budding yeast? These studies will shed light into the principles underlying and linking aging, rejuvenation and differentiation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,200,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BathyBiome"><Rcn>110443</Rcn><Nid>9184</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>The Symbiome of Bathymodiolus Mussels from Hydrothermal Vents: From the Genome to the Environment</Name><PI>Nicole Dubilier</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in 1977 was one of the most profound findings of the 20th century, revolutionizing our perception of energy sources fueling primary productivity on Earth. These ecosystems are based on chemosynthesis, that is the fixation of carbon dioxide into organic compounds as in photosynthesis, but using inorganic compounds such as sulfide, methane or hydrogen, as energy sources instead of sunlight. Hydrothermal vents support tremendous biomass and productivity of which the majority is generated through symbiotic microbe-animal associations. Bathymodiolus mussels are able to build extraordinarily large and productive communities at hydrothermal vents because they harbor symbiotic bacteria that use inorganic energy sources from the vent fluids to feed their hosts via carbon fixation. In addition to their beneficial symbionts, the mussels are infected by a novel bacterial parasite that exclusively invades and multiplies in their nuclei. In the work proposed here, I will use a wide array of tools that range from deep-sea in situ instruments to sophisticated molecular, 'omic' and imaging analyses to study the microbiome associated with Bathymodiolus mussels.

The bridge from biology to chemistry and physics is provided by structural biology: to understand the functioning of a cell, it is necessary to know the atomic structure of macromolecular assemblies, which may contain hundreds of components. To characterise the structures of the increasingly large and often flexible complexes, high resolution structure determination (as was possible for example for the ribosome) will likely stay the exception, and multiple sources of structural data at multiple resolutions are employed. Integrating these data into one consistent picture poses particular difficulties, since data are much more sparse than in high resolution methods, and the data sets from heterogeneous sources are of highly different and unknown quality and may be mutually inconsistent, and that data are in general averaged over large ensembles and long times. Molecular modelling, a crucial element of any structure determination, plays an even more important role in these multi-scale and multi-technique approaches, not only to obtain structures from the data, but also to evaluate their reliability. This proposal is to develop a consistent framework for this highly complex data integration problem, principally based on Bayesian probability theory. Appropriate models for the major types data types used in hybrid approaches will be developed, as well as representations to include structural knowledge for the components of the complexes, at multiple scales. The new methods will be applied to a series of problems with increasing complexity, going from the determination of protein complexes with high resolution information, over low resolution structures based on protein-protein interaction data such as the nuclear pore, to the genome organisation in the nucleus.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,130,212</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BetaImage"><Rcn>185396</Rcn><Nid>11947</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>An in vivo imaging approach to understand pancreatic beta-cell signal-transduction</Name><PI>Per-Olof Berggren</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The challenge in cell physiology/pathology today is to translate in vitro findings to the living organism. We have developed a unique approach where signal-transduction can be investigated in vivo non-invasively, longitudinally at single cell resolution, using the anterior chamber of the eye as a natural body window for imaging. We will use this approach to understand how the universally important and highly complex signal Ca2+ is regulated in the pancreatic beta-cell, while localized in the vascularized and innervated islet of Langerhans, and how that affects the insulin secretory machinery in vivo. Engrafted islets in the eye take on identical innervation- and vascularization patterns as those in the pancreas and are proficient in regulating glucose homeostasis in the animal. Since the pancreatic islet constitutes a micro-organ, this imaging approach offers a seminal model system to understand Ca2+ signaling in individual cells at the organ level in real life. We will test the hypothesis that the Ca2+-signal has a key role in pancreatic beta-cell function and survival in vivo and that perturbation in the Ca2+-signal serves as a common denominator for beta-cell pathology associated with impaired glucose homeostasis and diabetes. Of special interest is how innervation impacts on Ca2+-dynamics and the integration of autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signals in fine-tuning the Ca2+-signal with regard to beta-cell function and survival. We aim to define key defects in the machinery regulating Ca2+-dynamics in association with the autoimmune reaction, inflammation and obesity eventually resulting in diabetes. Our imaging platform will be applied to clarify in vivo regulation of Ca2+-dynamics in both healthy and diabetic human beta-cells. To define novel drugable targets for treatment of diabetes, it is crucial to identify similarities and differences in the molecular machinery regulating the in vivo Ca2+-signal in the human and in the rodent beta-cell.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,590</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BeyOND"><Rcn>111063</Rcn><Nid>8806</Nid><HI>Max-Delbruck-Centrum Fur Molekulare Medizin In Der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, Germany</HI><Name>METABOLIC BASIS OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE</Name><PI>Thomas Franz Erich Willnow</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia affecting millions of patients worldwide. Disturbingly, disorders of lipid and glucose metabolism emerge as major risk factors for onset and progression of neurodegeneration in the human population. Thus, an increasing life expectance combined with an observable rise in metabolic disturbances is expected to turn AD into one of the most serious health problems for future generations. Still, the molecular mechanisms whereby dysregulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis elicits noxious insults to the brain remain poorly understood. We characterized a novel class of intracellular sorting receptors, termed VPS10P domain receptors with dual roles in regulation of neuronal viability and function, but also in modulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Our proposal aims at elucidating an important yet poorly understood link between metabolism and neurodegeneration that converges on these receptors. Our approach is unique and novel in several ways. Thematically, our studies focus on a novel class of receptors previously not considered. Based on the receptors&#226;&#128;&#153; ability to act as sorting proteins, we propose faulty protein trafficking as a major unifying concept underlying neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. Conceptually, our approach relies on the interdisciplinary effort of neuroscientists and metabolism researchers working jointly on pathophysiological pathways converging on these receptors. Through this effort, we are confident to gain important insights into the crosstalk between brain and peripheral tissues, and to elucidate pathways common to metabolic disturbances and dementia, two prevailing degenerative disorders inflicting our societies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,415,229</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Bio-Phononics"><Rcn>185423</Rcn><Nid>10754</Nid><HI>University Of Glasgow, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Advanced Microfluidics &amp; Diagnostics using Acoustic Holograms &#226;&#128;&#147; Bio-Phononics</Name><PI>Jonathan Cooper</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal seeks to develop a novel technique for fluid and particle manipulations, based upon exploiting the mechanical interactions between acoustic waves and phononic. The new platform involves generating surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on piezoelectric chips, but, unlike previous work, the ultrasonic waves are first coupled into a phononic lattice, which is placed in the path of the ultrasonic wave. The phononic lattice comprises a miniaturised array of mechanical elements which modulates the sound in a manner analogous to how light is &#226;&#128;&#156;patterned&#226;&#128;&#157; using a hologram. However, whilst in an optical hologram, the pattern is created by exploiting the differences in refractive indices of the elements of the structure, here the ultrasonic field is modulated both by the elastic contrast between the elements in the array, as well as by the dimensions of the array and its surrounding matrix (including the size and pitch of the features within the array). The result of passing the acoustic wave through a phononic crystal is the formation of new and complex ultrasonic landscapes.

As part of the proposed  work we aim to understand the physics of this technology and to exploit its development in a range of medical devices. We will show that by using phononic crystals it is possible to create highly controllable patterns of acoustic field intensities, which propagate into the fluid, creating pressure differences that result in unique flow patterns to enable a new platform for including biological sample processing, medical diagnostics, drug delivery and blood clotting devices &#226;&#128;&#147; all on low cost disposable devices. Different frequencies of ultrasound will interact with different phononic structures to give different functions, providing a toolbox of different functions. Just as in electronics, where discrete components are combined to create circuits, so we propose to combine different phononic lattices to create fluidic microcircuits with important new applications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,208,594</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BioMecaMorph"><Rcn>108229</Rcn><Nid>12181</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>The Biomechanics of Epithelial Cell and Tissue Morphogenesis</Name><PI>Thomas Marie Michel Lecuit</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process that emerges from spatially controlled patterns of cell shape changes. Dedicated genetic programmes regulate cell behaviours, exemplified in animals by the specification of apical constriction in invaginating epithelial tissues, or the orientation of cell intercalation during tissue extension. This genetic control is constrained by physical properties of cells that dictate how they can modify their shape. A major challenge is to understand how biochemical pathways control subcellular mechanics in epithelia, such as how forces are produced by interactions between actin filaments and myosin motors, and how these forces are transmitted at cell junctions. The major objective of our project is to investigate the fundamental principles of epithelial mechanics and to understand how intercellular signals and mechanical coupling between cells coordinate individual behaviours at the tissue level.
We will study early Drosophila embryogenesis and combine quantitative cell biological studies of cell dynamics, biophysical characterization of cell mechanics and genetic control of cell signalling to answer the following questions: i) how are forces generated, in particular what underlies deformation and stabilization of cell shape by actomyosin networks, and pulsatile contractility; ii) how are forces transmitted at junctions, what are the feedback interactions between tension generation and transmission; iii) how are individual cell mechanics orchestrated at the tissue level to yield collective tissue morphogenesis?
We expect to encapsulate the information-based, cell biological and physical descriptions of morphogenesis in a single, coherent framework. The project should impact more broadly on morphogenesis in other organisms and shed light on the mechanisms underlying robustness and plasticity in epithelia.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,473,313</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BioMechTools"><Rcn>108061</Rcn><Nid>12877</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Biomechanical diagnostic, pre-planning and outcome tools to improve musculoskeletal surgery</Name><PI>Nicolaas Verdonschot</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The aetiology of many musculoskeletal (MS) diseases is related to biomechanical factors. However, the tools to assess the biomechanical condition of patients used by clinicians and researchers are often crude and subjective leading to non-optimal patient analyses and care. In this project innovations related to imaging, sensor technology and biomechanical modelling are utilized to generate versatile, accurate and objective methods to quantify the (pathological) MS condition of the lower extremity of patients in a unique manner. The project will produce advanced diagnostic, pre-planning and outcome tools which allow clinicians and researchers for detailed biomechanical analysis about abnormal tissue deformations, pathological loading of the joints, abnormal stresses in the hard and soft tissues, and aberrant joint kinematics.
The key objectives of this proposal are:
1) Develop and validate image-based 3-D volumetric elastographic diagnostic methods that can quantify normal and pathological conditions under dynamic loading and which can be linked to biomechanical modelling tools.
2) Create an ultrasound (US)-based system to assess internal joint kinematics which can be used as a diagnostic tool for clinicians and researchers and is a validation tool for biomechanical modelling.
3) Generate and validate an ambulant functional (force and kinematic) diagnostic system which is easy to use and which can be used to provide input data for biomechanical models.
4) Create and validate a new modelling approach that integrates muscle-models with finite element models at a highly personalized level.
5) Generate biomechanical models which have personalized mechanical properties of the hard and soft tissues.
6) Demonstrate the applicability of the personalized diagnostic and pre-planning platform by application to healthy individuals and patient subjects.

Its aim is to examine the temporal dynamics of species abundance distributions (SADs), and to assess the capacity of these distributions to withstand change (resistance) and to recover from change (resilience). These are topical and important questions given the increasing impact that humans are having on the natural world. There are three components to the research. First, we will model SADs and predict responses to a range of events including climate change and the arrival of invasive species. A range of modeling approaches (including neutral, niche and statistical) will be adopted; by incorporating temporal turnover in hitherto static models we will advance the field. Second, we will test predictions concerning the resistance and resilience of SADs by a comparative analysis of existing data sets (that encompass communities in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments for ecosystems extending from the poles to the tropics) and through a new field experiment that quantifies temporal turnover across a community (unicellular organisms to vertebrates) in relation to factors both natural (dispersal limitation) and anthropogenic (human disturbance) thought to shape SADs. In the final part of the project we will apply these new insights into the temporal dynamics of SADs to two important conservation challenges. These are 1) the conservation of biodiversity in a heavily utilized European landscape (Fife, Scotland) and 2) the conservation of biodiversity in Mamirau&#195;&#161; and Ama&#195;&#177;a reserves in Amazonian flooded forest. Taken together this research will not only shed new light on the structure of ecological communities but will also aid conservation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,812,782</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="BrainPower"><Rcn>94236</Rcn><Nid>12286</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Brain energy supply and the consequences of its failure</Name><PI>David Ian Attwell</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Energy, supplied in the form of oxygen and glucose in the blood, is essential for the brain s cognitive power. Failure of the energy supply to the nervous system underlies the mental and physical disability occurring in a wide range of economically important neurological disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy. Using a combination of two-photon imaging, electrophysiological, molecular and transgenic approaches, I will investigate the control of brain energy supply at the vascular level, and at the level of individual neurons and glial cells, and study the deleterious consequences for the neurons, glia and vasculature of a failure of brain energy supply. The work will focus on the following fundamental issues: A. Vascular control of the brain energy supply (1) How important is control of energy supply at the capillary level, by pericytes? (2) Which synapses control blood flow (and thus generate functional imaging signals) in the cortex? B. Neuronal and glial control of brain energy supply (3) How is grey matter neuronal activity powered? (4) How is the white matter supplied with energy? C.

(6) How similar are events in the grey and white matter in energy deprivation conditions? (7) How does a transient loss of energy supply affect blood flow regulation? (8) How does brain energy use change after a period without energy supply? Together this work will significantly advance our understanding of how the energy supply to neurons and glia is regulated in normal conditions, and how the loss of the energy supply causes disorders which consume more than 5% of the costs of European health services (5% of ~1000 billion euro/year).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,947</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CADRE"><Rcn>89291</Rcn><Nid>11689</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Cardiac Death and Regeneration</Name><PI>Michael David Schneider</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Cardiac muscle death, unmatched by muscle cell creation, is the hallmark of acute myocardial infarction and chronic cardiomyopathies. The notion of heart failure as a muscle-cell deficiency disease has driven interest worldwide in ways to increase heart muscle cell number, by over-riding cell cycle constraints, suppressing cell death, or, most directly, cell grafting. Using stem cell antigen-1, we previously identified telomerase-expressing cells in adult mouse myocardium, which have salutary properties for bona fide cardiac regeneration. Here, we seek to address systematically the mechanisms for long-term self-renewal in Sca-1+ adult cardiac progenitor cells and in the smaller  side population  fraction, which is clonogenic and expresses telomerase at even higher levels. Specifically, we propose to study the roles of telomerase and of the telomere-capping protein, TRF2. Aim 1, Determine the properties of adult cardiac progenitor cells in mice that lack the RNA component of telomerase (TERC). Aim 2, Determine the properties of adult cardiac progenitor cells in mice that lack the catalytic component (TERT). To distinguish between effects of these two gene products themselves versus those that depend on cumulative telomere dysfunction, G2- and G5-null mice will be compared.  Aim 3, Determine the properties of adult cardiac muscle and adult cardiac progenitor cells that lack the telomere-capping protein TRF2. Aim 4, Test the prediction that forced expression of TERT and TRF2 can augment cardiac muscle engraftment in vivo and enhance the clonal derivation of adult cardiac progenitor cells in vitro, without adversely affecting the cells  differentiation potential. Work proposed in Aims 1-3 would provide indispensable fundamental information about the function of endogenous telomerase in adult cardiac progenitor cells. Conversely, work in Aim 4 would test potential therapeutic implications of telomerase and a telomere-capping protein with this auspicious population.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,576</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CANBUILD"><Rcn>108330</Rcn><Nid>12821</Nid><HI>Queen Mary And Westfield College, University Of London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Building a Human Tumour Microenvironment</Name><PI>Frances Rosemary Balkwill</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Even at their earliest stages, human cancers are more than just cells with malignant potential. Cells and extracellular matrix components that normally support and protect the body are coerced into a tumour microenvironment that is central to disease progression. My hypothesis is that recent advances in tissue engineering, biomechanics and stem cell biology make it possible to engineer, for the first time, a complex 3D human tumour microenvironment in which individual cell lineages of malignant, haemopoietic and mesenchymal origin will communicate, evolve and grow in vitro. The ultimate aim is to build this cancerous tissue with autologous cells: there is an urgent need for models in which we can study the interaction of human immune cells with malignant cells from the same individual in an appropriate 3D biomechanical microenvironment.

To achieve the objectives of the CANBUILD project, I have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of collaborators with international standing in tumour microenvironment research, cancer treatment, tissue engineering, mechanobiology, stem cell research and 3D computer-assisted imaging.
The goal is to recreate the microenvironment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer metastases in the omentum. This is a major clinical problem, my lab has extensive knowledge of this microenvironment and we have already established simple 3D models of these metastases.

The research plan involves:
Deconstruction of this specific tumour microenvironment
Construction of artificial scaffold, optimising growth of cell lineages, assembly of the model
Comparison to fresh tissue
Investigating the role of individual cell lineages
Testing therapies that target the tumour microenvironment

My vision is that this project will revolutionise the practice of human malignant cell research, replacing misleading systems based on cancer cell monoculture on plastic surfaces and allowing us to better test new treatments that target the human tumour microenvironment.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,431,035</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CANCER&amp;AGEING"><Rcn>90232</Rcn><Nid>11216</Nid><HI>Fundacion Centro Nacional De Investigaciones Oncologicas Carlos Iii, Spain</HI><Name>COMMOM MECHANISMS UNDERLYING CANCER AND AGEING</Name><PI>Manuel Serrano</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"In recent years, we have made significant contributions to the understanding of the tumour suppressors p53, p16INK4a, and ARF, particularly in relation with cellular senescence and aging.

With regard to the INK4/ARF locus, the project includes: 1.1) the generation of null mice for the Regulatory Domain (RD) thought to be essential for the proper regulation of the locus; 1.2) the study of the INK4/ARF anti-sense transcription and its importance for the assembly of Polycomb repressive complexes; 1.3) the generation of mice carrying the human INK4/ARF locus to analyze, among other aspects, whether the known differences between the human and murine loci are ""locus autonomous""; and, 1.4) to analyze the INK4/ARF locus in the process of epigenetic reprogramming both from ES cells to differentiated cells and, conversely, from differentiated cells to induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.  With regard to the impact of ""anti-damage genes"" on cancer and aging, the project includes:  2.1) the analysis of the aging of super-INK4/ARF mice and super-p53 mice; 2.2) we have generated super-PTEN mice and we will examine whether PTEN not only confers cancer resistance but also anti-aging activity; and, finally, 2.3) we have generated super-SIRT1 mice, which is among the best-characterized anti-aging genes in non-mammalian model systems (where it is named Sir2) involved in protection from metabolic damage, and we will study the cancer and aging of these mice.

For all 3 types, non-invasive molecular diagnostics and prognostics are feasible via utilization of vaginal, oral and faecal samples, respectively. The project consequently aims to identify microbial markers in these &#194;&#191;readouts&#194;&#191; that correlate with cancer presence or progression. Microbial markers can be individual species or specific community compositions, but also particular genes or pathways. The microbial communities will be sampled locally at tumor surfaces and in healthy control tissues. After DNA extraction and sequencing, a complex bioinformatics pipeline will be developed to characterise the microbiomes and to identify the cancer-specific functional and phylogenetic markers therein. For colorectal cancer, the project intends to go into more details in that it tries i) to establish a correlation of microbiota with cancer progression and it ii) explores differences between distinct cancer subtypes. For each of the 3 cancer types, at least two samples from 40 individuals will be sequenced (as well as controls) at a depth of at least 5Gb each using Illumina technology. This is expected to be sufficient for the identification of microbial markers and also allows superficial genotyping of the individuals at ca 2-3x coverage as a by-product (the samples will contain considerable amounts of human DNA). Further analyses will be designed to study the potential of certain microbial species or community compositions to enhance or even cause one or more of the 3 cancers. The discovery of such causations will open up research towards directed antimicrobial treatment.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,233,740</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAPCAN"><Rcn>103906</Rcn><Nid>10521</Nid><HI>Universite De Namur Asbl, Belgium</HI><Name>Molecular and Genetic Study of the human infections by Capnocytophaga canimorsus</Name><PI>Guy Richard Cornelis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Capnocytophaga canimorsus are Gram-negative bacteria from the normal oral flora of dogs, which cause rare but  severe infections in humans that have been bitten or simply licked. The most common syndrome is fulminant septicemia with peripheral gangrene.  Mortality reaches 40 % in spite of antibiotherapy and amputations. My laboratory pioneered recently the study of this new pathogen.  We engineered genetic tools, sequenced and annotated the genome and determined the surface proteome of a strain isolated from a fatal infection.  This showed that C. canimorsus have abundant surface-exposed lipoproteins forming a new kind of feeding complexes, some of them specialized in deglycosylating glycoproteins from the host. This property allows C. canimorsus to feed by grazing oligosaccharides at the surface of human cells. The present research program aims at characterizing these deglycosylating complexes, unravelling their role in neutralizing the innate immunity and promoting growth within the host and finally characterizing their assembly at the bacterial surface. Genomic comparisons  will help defining which of these many complexes play a critical role in human pathogenesis.  Besides this, the lipopolysaccharide structure will be determined and genetically manipulated to understand its low endotoxicity and small anti-inflammatory effectors present in the culture supernatant of C. canimorsus will be identified.  Growth in human blood of wild type and mutant strains will be monitored by isothermal microcalorimetry in the hope of developing a surrogate of animal model.  Such a ""virulence"" model would allow to address the question whether all dog's strains are equally dangerous for humans. It would also open an avenue for testing differences in individual human susceptibility. All this knowledge will give new insights in this emerging pathogen and might lead to prevention of the disease caused by C. canimorsus"</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,473,338</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CAPER/BREAST CANCE"><Rcn>93146</Rcn><Nid>11639</Nid><HI>The University Of Manchester, United Kingdom</HI><Name>CAPER in Invasive Breast Cancer</Name><PI>Michael Lisanti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Breast cancer is a major cause of death in the United States and the Western World.

However, recent evidence confirms that fibroblasts interact directly with cardiac muscle cells in a way that is likely to affect their beat-by-beat activity.

To overcome limitations of traditional approaches to exploring these interactions in native tissue, we will build and explore murine models that express functional reporters (membrane potential, Vm; calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i) in fibroblasts, to identify how they are functionally integrated in native heart (myocyte =&gt; fibroblast effects). Next, we will express light-gated ion channels in murine fibroblast, to selectively interfere with their Vm (fibroblast =&gt; myocyte effects). Fibroblast-specific observation and interference will be conducted in normal and pathologically remodelled tissue, to characterise fibroblast relevance for heart function in health &amp; disease.

Based on these studies, we will generate 2 transgenic rabbits (fibroblast Vm reporting / interfering). Rabbit cardiac structure-function is more amenable to translational work, e.g. to study fibroblast involvement in normal origin &amp; spread of excitation across the heart, in pathological settings such as arrhythmogenicity of post-infarct scars (a leading causes of sudden death), or as a determinant of therapeutic outcomes such as in healing of atrial ablation lines (interfering with a key interventions to treat atrial fibrillation).

However, deregulated or chronic inflammation is harmful to the host and can cause multiple diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, neuroinflammatory disease and cancer. Cells of the innate immune system sense microbial or sterile danger via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Subsequently, these PRRs engage intracellular signalling modules to elicit inflammatory effector mechanisms. We have recently identified the CARD9 / BCL10 / MALT1 (CBM) signalosome as a central proinflammatory signalling complex in innate immune cells. This molecular platform responds to stimuli from transmembrane SYK-coupled C-type lectin receptors and from intracellular danger sensors such as RIG-I-like helicases, NOD2 and presumably others to robustly activate NF-&#206;&#186;B and MAPK pathways. Innate CBM signalling is engaged upon fungal, bacterial or viral recognition and upon sterile cell injury and it is essential for host protection in humans and mice. Still, it is unclear how the CARD9 / BCL10 / MALT1 signalosome is activated on a molecular level and how CBM responses are transduced to effector cascades. Moreover, although CARD9 polymorphisms are linked to various human inflammatory diseases, the cell type- and signal-specific roles of CBM signalosomes in complex diseases in vivo are unknown. Here we aim to take an integrated genetic, biochemical and in vivo approach to comprehensively dissect the regulation of the CARD9 / BCL10 / MALT1 complex in innate immunity and to define the role of this signalosome in clinically relevant inflammatory diseases. Mechanistic in vitro studies will be combined with the in vivo analysis of CBM function in genetically defined mouse models to gain better insights into the regulation of innate immunity and to pave the way to novel therapeutics for inflammatory diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,440,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CCC"><Rcn>102473</Rcn><Nid>9566</Nid><HI>Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Cracking the Cerebellar Code</Name><PI>Christiaan Innocentius De Zeeuw</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Spike trains transfer information to and from neurons. Most studies so far assume that the average firing rate or &#226;&#128;&#156;rate coding&#226;&#128;&#157; is the predominant way of information coding. However, spikes occur at millisecond precision, and their actual timing or &#226;&#128;&#156;temporal coding&#226;&#128;&#157; can in principle strongly increase the information content of spike trains. The two coding mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Neurons may switch between rate and temporal coding, or use a combination of both coding mechanisms at the same time, which would increase the information content of spike trains even further. Here, we propose to investigate the hypothesis that temporal coding plays, next to rate coding, important and specific roles in cerebellar processing during learning. The cerebellum is ideal to study this timely topic, because it has a clear anatomy with well-organized modules and matrices, a well-described physiology of different types of neurons with distinguishable spiking activity, and a central role in various forms of tractable motor learning. Moreover, uniquely in the brain, the main types of neurons in the cerebellar system can be genetically manipulated in a cell-specific fashion, which will allow us to investigate the behavioural importance of both coding mechanisms following cell-specific interference and/or during cell-specific visual imaging. Thus, for this proposal we will create conditional mouse mutants that will be subjected to learning paradigms in which we can disentangle the contributions of rate coding and temporal coding using electrophysiological and optogenetic recordings and stimulation. Together, our experiments should elucidate how neurons in the brain communicate during natural learning behaviour and how one may be able to intervene in this process to affect or improve procedural learning skills."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CD-LINK"><Rcn>106937</Rcn><Nid>12976</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Groningen, Netherlands</HI><Name>Celiac disease: from lincRNAs to disease mechanism</Name><PI>Tjitske Nienke Wijmenga</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Celiac disease affects at least 1% of the world population. Its onset is triggered by gluten, a common dietary protein, however, its etiology is poorly understood. More than 80% of patients are not properly diagnosed and they therefore do not follow a gluten-free diet, thereby increasing their risk for disease-associated complications and early death. A better understanding of the disease biology would improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of celiac disease.

This project investigates the disease mechanisms in celiac disease by using predisposing genes and genetic variants as disease initiating factors. Specifically, it will investigate if long, intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are causally involved in celiac disease pathogenesis by regulating protein-coding genes and pathways associated with the disease.

This project is based on two important observations by my group: (1) Our genetic studies, which led to identifying 39 celiac disease risk loci, suggest that the mechanism underlying the disease is largely governed by dysregulation of gene expression. (2) We uncovered a previously unrecognized role for lincRNAs that provides clues as to exactly how genetic variation causes disease, as this class of biologically important RNA molecules regulate gene expression.

The research will be performed in CD4+ T cells, a severely affected cell type in disease pathology. I will first use celiac disease-associated protein-coding genes to delineate their regulatory pathways and then study the transcriptional programs of lincRNAs present in celiac disease loci. Next I will combine the information and investigate if the expressed lincRNAs modulate the pathways and affect T cell function, thereby discovering if lincRNAs are a missing link between non-coding genetic variation and protein-coding genes. Our findings may well lead to potential therapeutic targets and provide a solid scientific basis for new diagnostic markers, particularly biomarkers, based on genetics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,319,914</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CD8 T CELLS"><Rcn>90223</Rcn><Nid>12902</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Development and differentiation of CD8 T lymphocytes</Name><PI>Benedita Rocha</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>CD8 T lymphocytes have a fundamental role in ensuring the control of different types of intracellular pathogens including bacteria, parasites and most viruses. This control may fail due to several reasons. The current aggressive anti-cancer therapies (or rarely certain congenital immune deficiencies) induce CD8 depletion. After bone-marrow transplantation, long time periods are required to ensure T cell reconstitution particularly in the adult. This long lag-time is due to the long-time periods required for hematopoietic precursors to generate T lymphocytes and to a thymus insufficiency in the adult. However, even when CD8 T cells are present CD8 immune responses are not always adequate. Certain chronic infections, as HIV, induce CD8 dysfunction and it is yet unclear how to generate efficient CD8 memory responses conferring adequate protection. To address these questions this project aims 1) To find strategies ensuring the rapid reconstitution of the peripheral and the gut CD8 T cell compartments a) by studying the mechanisms involved HSC division and T cell commitment; b) by isolating and characterizing progenitors we previously described that are T cell committed and able of an accelerated CD8 reconstitution c) by developing new strategies that may allow stable thymus transplantation and continuous thymus T cell generation. 2) To determine the mechanics associated to efficient CD8 memory generation a) by evaluating cellular modifications that ensure the efficient division and the remarkable accumulation and survival of CD8 T cells during the adequate immune responses as compared to inefficient responses b) by studying CD8 differentiation into effector and memory cells in both conditions. These studies will use original experiment mouse models we develop in the laboratory, that allow to address each of these aims. Besides state of the art methods, they will also apply unique very advanced approaches we introduced and are the sole laboratory to perform.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,969,644</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CDREG"><Rcn>107912</Rcn><Nid>9460</Nid><HI>The University Of Sheffield, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Carbon dioxide regulation of Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s ecological weathering engine: from microorganisms to ecosystems</Name><PI>David Beerling</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>CDREG develops the major new Earth system science research hypothesis that tectonic-related variations in Earth&#226;&#128;&#153;s atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]a) drive negative ecological feedbacks on terrestrial silicate weathering rates that stabilise further [CO2]a change and regulate climate.

WP2 quantifies the role [CO2]a-drought interactions on savanna tree mortality and C4 grass survivorship, plus symbiotic fungal-driven mineral weathering. WP3 exploits the past 8 Ma of marine sediment archives to investigate the links between forest to savanna transition, terrestrial weathering, fire, and climate in Africa.  WP4 integrates findings from WP1-3 into a new Earth system modelling framework to rigorously investigate the biogeochemical feedbacks of [CO2]a-regulated ecological weathering on [CO2]a via marine carbonate deposition and organic C burial.

The structure of chromatin is responsible for compacting DNA to fit within the nucleus and for governing its access in nuclear processes. Epigenetic information is encoded chiefly via chromatin modifications. Readout of the genetic code depends on chromatin remodeling, a process actively altering chromatin structure. An understanding of the hierarchical structure of chromatin and of structurally based, remodeling mechanisms will have enormous impact for developments in medicine.

Following our high resolution structure of the nucleosome core particle, the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, we have endeavored to determine the structure of the chromatin fiber. We showed with our X-ray structure of a tetranucleosome how nucleosomes could be organized in the fiber. Further progress has been limited by structural polymorphism and crystal disorder, but new evidence on the in vivo spacing of nucleosomes in chromatin should stimulate more advances. Part A of this application describes how we would apply these new findings to our cryo-electron microscopy study of the chromatin fiber and to our crystallographic study of a tetranucleosome containing linker histone.

Recently, my laboratory succeeded in providing the first structurally based mechanism for nucleosome spacing by a chromatin remodeling factor. We combined the X-ray structure of ISW1a(&#239;&#129;&#132;ATPase) bound to DNA with cryo-EM structures of the factor bound to two different nucleosomes to build a model showing how this remodeler uses a dinucleosome, not a mononucleosome, as its substrate. Our results from a functional assay using ISW1a further justified this model. Part B of this application describes how we would proceed to the relevant cryo-EM and X-ray structures incorporating dinucleosomes. Our recombinant ISW1a allows us to study in addition the interaction of the ATPase domain with nucleosome substrates."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHOLINOMIRS"><Rcn>107242</Rcn><Nid>12180</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>CholinomiRs: MicroRNA Regulators of Cholinergic Signalling in the Neuro-Immune Interface</Name><PI>Hermona Soreq</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Communication between the nervous and the immune system is pivotal for maintaining homeostasis and ensuring rapid and efficient reaction to stress and infection insults. The emergence of microRNAs (miRs) as regulators of gene expression and of acetylcholine (ACh) signalling as regulator of anxiety and inflammation provides a model for studying this interaction. My hypothesis is that 1) a specific sub-group of miRs, designated ""CholinomiRs"", may silence multiple target genes in the neuro-immune interface; 2) these miRs compete with each other on the interaction with their targets, and 3) mutations interfering with miR binding lead to inherited susceptibility to anxiety and inflammation disorders by modifying these interactions. Our preliminary findings have shown that by targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), CholinomiR-132 can intensify acute stress, resolve intestinal inflammation and change post-ischemic stroke responses. Further, we have identified clustered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) interfering with AChE silencing by several miRs which associate with elevated trait anxiety, blood pressure and inflammation. To further study miR regulators of ACh signalling, I plan to: (1) Identify anxiety and inflammation-induced changes in CholinomiRs and their targets in challenged brain and immune cells. (2) Establish the roles of these targets for one selected CholinomiR by tissue-specific manipulations. (3) Study primate-specific CholinomiRs by continued human DNA screens to identify SNPs and in ""humanized"" mice with knocked-in human AChE and transgenic CholinomiR-608. (4) Test if therapeutic modulation of aberrant CholinomiR expression can restore homeostasis. This research will clarify how miRs interact with each other in health and disease, introduce the dimension of complexity of multi-target competition and miR interactions and make a conceptual change in miRs research while enhancing the ability to intervene with diseases involving impaired ACh signalling."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,375,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMARRANGE"><Rcn>99149</Rcn><Nid>12128</Nid><HI>University College Dublin, National University Of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland</HI><Name>Programmed and unprogrammed genomic rearrangements during the evolution of yeast species</Name><PI>Kenneth Henry Wolfe</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"By detailed evolutionary comparisons among multiple sequenced yeast genomes, we have identified several unusual regions where our preliminary evidence suggests that previously unknown molecular biology phenomena, involving rearrangement of genomic DNA, are occurring. I now propose to use a combination of dry-lab and wet-lab experimental approaches to characterize these regions and phenomena further. One region is a 24-kb section of chromosome XIV that appears to undergo recurrent 'flip/flop' inversion between two isomers at a fairly high rate in five species as diverse as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Naumovia castellii, leading to a 1:1 ratio of the two isomers in each species. We hypothesize that this region is the site of a programmed DNA rearrangement analogous to mating-type switching. We have also identified two new genes related to the mating-type switching endonuclease HO, but different from it, that are potentially involved in rearrangement processes though not necessarily the inversion described above. We will determine the sites of action of these endonucleases. Separately, we have found evidence for a process of recurrent deletion of DNA from regions flanking the mating-type (MAT) locus in all yeast species that are descended from the whole-genome duplication (WGD) event, causing continual transpositions of genes from beside MAT to other locations in the genome. In related computational work, we propose to investigate an hypothesis that evolutionary loss of the MATa2 transcriptional activator may have been the cause of the WGD event."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,516,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMATINPRINCIPLES"><Rcn>102541</Rcn><Nid>10362</Nid><HI>Stichting Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut-Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis, Netherlands</HI><Name>Principles of Chromatin Organization</Name><PI>Bas Van Steensel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Chromatin is the ensemble of genomic DNA and hundreds of structural and regulatory proteins.

My lab discovered that chromatin in Drosophila consists of a limited number of principal types that partition the genome into domains with distinct regulatory properties. Among these is BLACK chromatin, a novel repressive type of chromatin that covers nearly half of the fly genome. It is still largely unclear how these different chromatin types are formed, how they are targeted to specific genomic regions, and how they interact with each other.
Here, I propose a combination of systematic approaches aimed to gain insight into the basic mechanisms that drive the partioning of the genome into distinct chromatin types. New genomics techniques, developed in my laboratory, will be used to construct an integrated view of the interplay of more than one hundred representative chromatin proteins with each other and with sequence elements in the genome. Specifically, we will: (1) Study the genome-wide dynamic repositioning of chromatin domains during development in relation to gene regulation; (2) Use a novel and versatile parallel genome-wide reporter assay to dissect the interplay among DNA sequences and chromatin types; (3) Combine computational modeling with a high-throughput genome-wide assay to uncover the network of interactions responsible for the formation of the principal chromatin types; (4) Dissect the molecular architecture of BLACK chromatin and its role in gene repression.
The results will provide understanding of the basic principles that govern the structure and composition of chromatin, and reveal how the principal chromatin types together direct gene expression."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,080</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CHROMATINSYS"><Rcn>110551</Rcn><Nid>10812</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Systematic Approach to Dissect the Interplay between Chromatin and Transcription</Name><PI>Nir Friedman</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in regulating and maintaining the functionality of cells and have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases. Histone proteins that form the protein core of nucleosomes are subject to a bewildering array of covalent and structural modifications, which can repress, permit, or promote transcription. These modifications can be added and removed by specialized complexes that are recruited by other covalent modifications, by transcription factors, or by the transcriptional machinery. Advances in genomics led to comprehensive mapping of the ``epigenome'' in a range of tissues and organisms. These maps established the tight connection between histone modifications and transcription programs. These static charts, however, are less successful at uncovering the underlying mechanisms, logic, and function of histone modifications in establishing and maintaining transcriptional programs. Our premise is that we can answer these basic questions by observing the effect of genetic perturbations on the dynamics of both chromatin state and transcriptional activity.  We aim to dissect the chromatin-transcription system in a systematic manner by building on our extensive experience in modeling and analysis, and a unique high-throughput experimental system we established in my lab.

We plan to use the budding yeast model organism, which allows for
efficient genetic and experimental manipulations. We will combine two technologies: (1) high-throughput measurements of single-cell
transcriptional output using fluorescence reporters; and (2) high-throughput immunoprecipitation sequencing assays to map chromatin state.

Centimetre-long DNA molecules are packed into micrometer-sized chromosomes to enable this process. How DNA is organised within mitotic chromosomes is still largely unknown. A key structural protein component of mitotic chromosomes, implicated in their compaction, is the condensin complex. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the molecular architecture of mitotic chromosomes, taking advantage of new genomic techniques and the relatively simple genome organisation of yeast model systems. We will place particular emphasis on elucidating the contribution of the condensin complex, and the cell cycle regulation of its activities, in promoting chromosome condensation. Our previous work has provided genome-wide maps of condensin binding to budding and fission yeast chromosomes. We will continue to decipher the molecular determinants for condensin binding. To investigate how condensin mediates DNA compaction, we propose to generate chromosome-wide DNA/DNA proximity maps. Our approach will be an extension of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique. High throughput sequencing of interaction points has provided a first glimpse of the interactions that govern chromosome condensation. The role that condensin plays in promoting these interactions will be investigated. The contribution of condensin s ATP-dependent activities, and cell cycle-dependent post-translational modifications, will be studied. This will be complemented by mathematical modelling of the condensation process. In addition to chromosome condensation, condensin is required for resolution of sister chromatids in anaphase. We will develop an assay to study the catenation status of sister chromatids and how condensin may contribute to their topological resolution.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,076,126</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CIRCUIT"><Rcn>89138</Rcn><Nid>9797</Nid><HI>Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet Ntnu, Norway</HI><Name>Neural circuits for space representation in the mammalian cortex</Name><PI>Edvard Ingjald Moser</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Neuroscience is one of the fastest-developing areas of science, but it is fair to say that we are still far from understanding how the brain produces subjective experience.

These phenomena all emerge from interactions between large numbers of diverse cells in intermingled neural circuits. A major obstacle has been the absence of concepts and tools for investigating neural computation at the circuit level. The aim of this proposal is to combine new transgenic methods for cell type-specific intervention with large-scale multisite single-cell recording to determine how a basic cognitive function   self-localization   is generated in a functionally well-described mammalian neural circuit. We shall use our recent discovery of entorhinal grid cells as an access ramp. Grid cells fire only when the animal moves through certain locations.

Grid cells co-exist with other entorhinal cell types encoding head direction, geometric borders, or conjunctions of features. This network is thought to form an essential part of the brain s coordinate system for metric navigation but the detailed wiring, the mechanism of grid formation, and the function of each morphological and functional cell type all remain to be determined. We shall address these open questions by measuring how dynamic spatial representation is affected by transgene-induced activation or inactivation of the individual components of the circuit.

How variable transcriptional programs can regulate robust embryonic development remains a long-standing question, which this proposal aims to address.

Important physiological processes, such as aging, and pathological mechanisms, such as neurodegeneration, are strictly dependent on cellular clearance. In eukaryotes, most of the cellular clearing processes occur in a specialized organelle, the lysosome. This project is based on a recent discovery, made in our laboratory, of a gene network, which we have named CLEAR, that controls lysosomal biogenesis and function and regulates cellular clearance. The specific goals of the project are: 1) the comprehensive characterization of the mechanisms underlying the CLEAR network, 2) the thorough understanding of CLEAR physiological function at the cellular and organism levels, 3) the development of strategies and tools to modulate cellular clearance, and 4) the implementation of proof-of-principle therapeutic studies based on the activation of the CLEAR network in murine models of human lysosomal storage disorders and of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers s and Huntington s diseases. A combination of genomics, bioinformatics, systems biology, chemical genomics, cell biology, and mouse genetics approaches will be used to achieve these goals. Our goal is to develop tools to modulate cellular clearance and to use such tools to develop therapies to cure human disease.

This computational model will be tested by multiple neuron recordings in the major basal ganglia structures of monkeys engaged in a similar behavioral task. We will further validate the RMDOO computational model of the basal ganglia by extending our previous studies of neural activity in the MPTP primate model of Parkinson's disease to a primate model of central serotonin depletion and emotional dysregulation disorders. The findings in the primate model of emotional dysregulation will then be compared to electrophysiological recordings carried out in human patients with treatment-resistant major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder during deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures. I aim to find neural signatures (e.g., synchronous gamma oscillations in the actor part of the basal ganglia as predicted by the RMDOO model) characterizing these emotional disorders and to use them as triggers for closed loop adaptive DBS. Our working hypothesis holds that, as for the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease, closed loop DBS will lead to greater amelioration of the emotional deficits in serotonin depleted monkeys.
This project incorporates extensive collaborations with a team of neurosurgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, and computer science/ neural network researchers.

In the past few years, we have resolved the structural details of the large complement proteins involved in the central, aspecific labelling and amplification step; with recent data we revealed the structural basis of the assembly and activity of the protease complex associated with this step. These insights into the central aspecific reaction, and the experiences gained on working with these large multi-domain proteins and complexes, give us an excellent starting point to addres the questions of specificity, protection and activation of immune cells.

The goal of the proposal is to elucidate the multivalent molecular mechanisms of recognition, regulation and immune cell activation of the complement system on target membranes. We will use protein crystallography and electron microscopy to study the interactions and conformational changes involved in protein complex formation, and (single-molecule) fluorescence to resolve the multivalent molecular events, the conformational states and transitions that occur on the membrane. The combined data will provide mechanistic insights into the specifity of immune clearance by the complement system.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of complement activation and regulation will be instrumental in developing more potent therapeutics to control infections, prevent tissue damage and fight tumours by immunotherapies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,700,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COGATIMABIO"><Rcn>94343</Rcn><Nid>12674</Nid><HI>University Of Kent, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Combined time domain and spectral domain coherence gating for imaging and biosensing</Name><PI>Adrian Podoleanu</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Revolutionary combination of principles of spectral domain and time domain coherence gating will be researched. The present proposal puts forward: (i) a novel class of optical interferometers, (ii) a novel class of wavefront sensors and (iii) combinations of imaging channels with the novel wavefront sensors. All these are driven by the needs to address the limitations in terms of speed of the time domain (TD) optical coherence tomography (OCT), in terms of range, resolution and focus of the spectral (SD) OCT methods and in terms of spatial resolution of wavefront sensors. A new class of OCT systems is researched, as a marriage between the TD-OCT and SD-OCT methods. The novel methods present the generality of being compatible with both TD-OCT and SD-OCT. It is envisaged that the research results will revolutionise the field of high resolution imaging and high sensitive sensing and open applications not currently possible with the present OCT, confocal microscopy or multiphoton microscopy technology. The method to be researched will allow versatile functionality in measurements, in 3D imaging of moving tissue and functional/low noise imaging by making use of angular compounding or polarisation. Novel directions are opened in the tracking of the axial position of objects (cornea or retina), automatic dispersion compensation as well as improvement in the synchronism between the coherence gate and the focus in axial scanning. Simultaneous measurements over multiple path lengths becomes feasible, with potential applications in high throughput sensing. The methods proposed open novel avenues in biosensing by amplification of tiny frequency shifts or tiny changes in the optical paths. Possible outcome are high sensitive biosensors, multiple imaging at different depths, fast and long range tracking, long axial scanning, coherence gated wavefront sensors with applications in vision sciences and microscopy, protein identification and contrast agents developments."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,241</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COGSYSTEMS"><Rcn>94355</Rcn><Nid>12557</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Parma, Italy</HI><Name>Understanding actions and intentions of others</Name><PI>Giacomo Rizzolatti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>How do we understand the actions and intentions of others? Hereby we intend to address this issue by using a multidisciplinary approach. Our project is subdivided into four parts. In the first part we investigate the neural organization of monkey area F5, an area deeply involved in motor act understanding. By using a new set of electrodes we will describe the columnar organization of the area F5, establish the temporal relationships between the activity of F5 mirror and motor neurons, and correlate the activity of mirror neurons coding the observed motor acts in peripersonal and extrapersonal space with the activity of motor neurons in the same cortical column. In the second part we will assess the neural mechanism underlying the understanding of the intention of complex actions , i.e. actions formed by a sequence of two (or more) individual actions. The focus will be on the neurons located in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, an area involved in the organization of high-order motor behavior. The rational of the experiment is that, while the organization of single actions and the understanding of intention behind them is function of parietal neurons, that of complex actions relies on the activity of the prefrontal lobe. In the third and fourth parts of the project we will delimit the cortical areas involved in understanding the goal (the what) and the intention (the why) of the observed actions in individuals with typical development (TD) and in children with autism and will establish the time relation between these two processes. Our hypothesis is that the chained organization of intentional motor acts is impaired in children with autism and this impairment prevents them from organizing normally their actions and from understanding others intentions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,992,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COMBINE"><Rcn>89115</Rcn><Nid>9599</Nid><HI>Institut Fuer Molekulare Biotechnologie Gmbh, Austria</HI><Name>From flies to humans combining whole genome screens and tissue specific gene targeting to identify novel pathways involved in cancer and metastases</Name><PI>Josef Martin Penninger</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cancer care will be revolutionized over the next decade by the introduction of novel therapeutics that target the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease. With the advent of human genetics, a plethora of genes have been correlated with human diseases such as cancer the SNP maps. Since the sequences are now available, the next big challenge is to determine the function of these genes in the context of the entire organism. Genetic animal models have proven to be extremely valuable to elucidate the essential functions of genes in normal physiology and the pathogenesis of disease. Using gene-targeted mice we have previously identified RANKL as a master gene of bone loss in arthritis, osteoporosis, and cancer cell migration and metastases and genes that control heart and kidney function; wound healing; diabetes; or lung injury  Our primary goal is to use functional genomics in Drosophila and mice to understand cell transformation, invasion, and cancer metastases of epithelial tumors. The following projects are proposed: 1. Role of the key osteoclast differentiation factors RANKL-RANK and its downstream signalling cascade in the development of breast and prostate cancer. 2. Requirement of osteoclasts for bone metastases and stem cell niches using a new RANKfloxed allele; function of RANKL-RANK in local tumor cell invasion. 3.

Yet our understanding of the genetics underlying such traits in humans remains extremely limited, due largely to the statistical complexity of inferring the effects of  allelic variants in a genetically diverse population. Novel tools for the dissection of the genetic architecture of complex traits, therefore, can be most effectively developed in model organisms, where the contribution of individual alleles can be quantitatively determined in controlled genetic backgrounds. We have previously established the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model for complex traits by unravelling complex genetic architectures that govern quantitative phenotypes in this organism. We achieved this by pioneering approaches that have revealed crucial information about the complexity of the underlying genetics. Here we propose to advance to the next level of complex trait dissection by developing systematic, genome-wide technologies that aim to identify all of the variants underlying a complex trait in a single step. In particular, we will investigate traits involved in mitochondrial function, which are both clinically relevant and highly conserved in yeast. Our combination of genomic technologies will allow us to: 1) systematically detect, with maximal sensitivity, the majority of genetic variants (coding and non-coding) that condition these traits; 2) quantify the contributions of these variants and their interactions; and 3) evaluate the strengths and limitations of current methods for dissecting complex traits. Taken together, our research will yield fundamental insights into the genetic complexity of multifactorial traits, providing valuable lessons and establishing novel genomic tools that will facilitate the investigation of complex diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,821</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COMREC"><Rcn>99500</Rcn><Nid>9342</Nid><HI>Karlsruher Institut Fuer Technologie, Germany</HI><Name>Designed Plant Breeding by Control of Meiotic Recombination</Name><PI>Holger Alexander Puchta</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Agriculture depends on breeding. Breeders try to combining desirable and eliminating unfavourable traits of crop plants. Changes in genetic linkage are based on meiotic recombination. Although techniques for the transfer of single traits have been developed, resulting in genetically modified organisms (GMOs), hardly any effort has been undertaken to control the exchange between parental genomes as such. By applying new molecular tools to control recombination the current project aims to establish a new kind of &#194;&#191;designed&#194;&#191; plant breeding. Thus, not only transfer or elimination of specific traits should become possible in a programmable way, but also the access to the complete gene pool of natural species and its widening by crossing in closely related species should become feasible. Suppression of recombination should result in an apomixis-like propagation of elite cultivars. Mainly two different levels of control will be addressed in the project: the induction of recombination at predefined specific sites in the genome and the regulation of the level of genome-wide exchange. For the former approach we will apply specifically tailored sequence-specific zinc-finger and meganucleases. Global changes should be achieved by modulating the expression of factors involved in the resolution of recombination intermediates. As the strategy relies on the exploitation of the natural mechanism of recombination, biotechnologically improved plants without transgenes will be obtained after outcrossing. Thus, public concerns raised by GMOs brought out in the field should be avoided. As recent technical improvements make the elucidation of genomic sequences possible at moderate cost and time requirements, the setup of &#194;&#191;designed&#194;&#191; breeding should become especially useful in the near future."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CONCEPT"><Rcn>102882</Rcn><Nid>10563</Nid><HI>Scuola Internazionale Superiore Di Studi Avanzati, Italy</HI><Name>Construction of Perception from Touch Signals</Name><PI>Mathew Diamond</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Our sensory systems gather stimuli as elemental physical features yet we perceive a world made up of familiar objects, not wavelengths or vibrations. Perception occurs when the neuronal representation of physical parameters is transformed into the neuronal representation of meaningful objects. How does this recoding occur? An ideal platform for the inquiry is the rat whisker sensory system: it produces fast and accurate judgments of complex stimuli, yet can be broken down into accessible neuronal mechanisms. CONCEPT will examine the process that begins with whisker motion and ends with perception of the contacted object. Understanding the general principles for the construction of perception will help explain why we experience the world as we do.
The main hypothesis is that graded neuronal representations at early processing stages are &#226;&#128;&#156;fractured&#226;&#128;&#157; to generate discrete object representations at late processing stages. Of particular interest is the emergence of object representations as the meaning of new stimuli is acquired.
We will collect multi-site single-unit and local field potential signals simultaneously with precise behavioral indices, and will interpret data through advanced computational methods. We will begin by quantifying whisker motion as rats discriminate texture, thus defining the raw material on which the brain operates. Next, we will characterize the transformation of texture along an intracortical stream from sensory areas (where we expect that neurons encode whisker kinematics) to frontal and rhinal areas (where we expect that neurons encode objects extracted from the graded physical continuum) and hippocampus (where we expect that neurons encode objects in conjunction with context).

A large body of research implicates the amygdala in fear of painful stimuli, but virtually nothing is known about the circuits that support fear of predators and social threats, despite their primal importance in human behavior and pathology. Unlike painful stimuli, predator and social threats activate the medial hypothalamus, a cluster of highly conserved brain nuclei that control motivated behavior. Intriguingly, predator and social threats recruit largely non-overlapping nuclei in the medial hypothalamus, and we have recently demonstrated that separate medial hypothalamic circuits are essential for predator and social fear. We aim to build a functional wiring diagram of predator and social fear in the mouse that will explain how these fears are triggered, coordinated, and remembered. Such a functional wiring diagram will reveal the network logic of innate fear and put us in a position to selectively intervene in fear processing. Electrical stimulation of the medial hypothalamus in humans elicits panic responses and pharmacological agents that block these circuits will offer unexplored therapeutic approaches to treat anxiety disorders such as panic, social phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, the relatively simple architecture of the medial hypothalamic fear network and its robust and direct behavioral readout in the mouse will be a powerful platform to test the role of several fundamental circuit features that are common to a wide range of behavioral networks, but whose function remains unknown, including the role of feedback loops, sparse cellular encoding of behavior, and overlapping processing of distinct behavioral responses. In this way, the project will provide the first circuit-level understanding of predator and social fear and answer a series of fundamental questions about how neural networks control behavior.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,839</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORTEX"><Rcn>90204</Rcn><Nid>9839</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Computations by Neurons and Populations in Visual Cortex</Name><PI>Matteo Carandini</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1) receive feedforward inputs from thalamic afferents and lateral inputs from other cortical neurons. Little is known about how these components interact to determine the responses of a V1 neuron. One camp ascribes most responses to feedforward mechanisms. The other camp ascribes them mostly to lateral interactions.   We propose that these two apparently opposed views can be simply reconciled in a single framework. We hypothesize that area V1 can operate both in a feedforward regime and in a lateral interaction regime, depending on the nature of the stimulus and on the cognitive task at hand, and that the transition from one regime to the other is governed by synaptic inhibition.  We will test these hypotheses by recording from individual V1 neurons while monitoring the activity of nearby populations of cortical neurons via multiprobe electrodes.  In Aim 1 we will relate the activity of V1 neurons to that of nearby populations. We will use simple measures of correlation and nonlinear models that predict individual spikes to measure how responses depend on a feedforward contribution (the  receptive field ) and on a lateral contribution (the  connection field ). We will test our first hypothesis, concerning the role of the stimulus in changing this dependence.  In Aim 2 we will extend these results to a behaving animal. We will record from V1 of mice performing a 2-alternative forced-choice psychophysical task, and we will test our second hypothesis, concerning the role of the cognitive task in determining the operating regime of the cortex.  In Aim 3 we will seek a biophysical interpretation of the functional mechanisms and effective connectivity revealed by the previous Aims.

Many studies focus on mammalian neocortex, a modular and versatile structure that operates equally well with different sensory inputs and for perception, planning as well as action. Neocortex, however, is remarkably complex. It contains many cell types, six layers, networks with local and long-range connections, and its study is technically challenging. We propose here to address central issues of cortical computation using a simpler experimental system. Neocortex evolved from a more primitive cortex, likely present in the ancestors of all amniotes. Extant reptiles are closest to this putative ancestor: their cortex contains only three layers, two of which are nearly exclusively neuropilar. Reptilian cortex is also closest to mammals&#226;&#128;&#153; old cortices (piriform and hippocampus). Like in mammals, reptilian cortex is modular. Its design, however, is considerably simpler and more ubiquitous than in mammals. Indeed, so far as we know, reptilian primary olfactory and visual cortices are very similar to one another. Finally, certain reptiles such as turtles have evolved biochemical and metabolic adaptations to resist long periods of anoxia. Thus, their brains can be studied ex vivo over long periods, giving experimenters access to the entire brain with an intact retina or nasal epithelium. We will use this system to study cortical computation, primarily in visual and olfactory areas. Using electrophysiological, imaging, molecular, behavioral and computational methods, we will discover the representational strategies of these two cortices in vivo, the functional architecture of their microcircuits and the computations that they carry out. This understanding of generic and ancient units of cortical computation will illuminate our studies of more complex and sophisticated cortical circuits."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,111</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CORTICAL ASSEMBLY"><Rcn>103159</Rcn><Nid>11925</Nid><HI>King's College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Excitatory and inhibitory cell assemblies in the cerebral cortex</Name><PI>Oscar Marin Parra</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The neural assembly underlying the formation of functional networks in the cerebral cortex is conceivably the most complex biological system that exists.  Much of this complexity arises during development through the interaction of dozens of different neuronal populations, which belong to two general classes: excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal cells and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric containing (GABAergic) interneurons.  Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the assembly of cortical circuits is that pyramidal cells and interneurons are generated in distant germinal zones.  Pyramidal cells are born locally from progenitors located in the cortical anlage, while interneurons derive from progenitors in the embryonic subpallium.  Much progress has been made recently in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the migration of interneurons towards the cortex, but how interneurons find their appropriate partners to build cortical networks with balanced excitation and inhibition remains an enigma.
The general goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms controlling the precise allocation of different classes of interneurons into specific layers of the cortex, where they assemble into neural circuits.  We also aim to determine how the allocation of interneurons into specific cortical layers influences their function.  This project is now possible due to the unique combination of our detailed know-how on the early development of cortical interneurons, including a variety of genetically modified mice available to us, and the application of new technologies to specifically target synchronically generated populations of interneurons.  Our multidisciplinary approach, combining mouse genetics, in vivo functional genomics and electrophysiological methodologies represents a technological breakthrough that should accelerate our understanding of the general principles guiding the assembly of neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,481</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="COSIMO"><Rcn>103198</Rcn><Nid>10548</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>COVALENT SINGLE-MOLECULE CHEMISTRY OF THE CELL</Name><PI>John Hagan Pryce Bayley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"A label-free single-molecule technology developed the PI's laboratory will be exploited to elucidate covalent chemistry of relevance to the cell.

The function of the vast majority of these RNAs is unknown. Evidence over many years has revealed that transcription factors and chromatin regulators are associated with a variety of non-coding (nc)RNAs, but their function remains largely unknown. There are a few cases where a role has been ascribed for ncRNAs in transcription, but no clear mechanistic insight has been defined yet. We predict that many of the newly identified ncRNAs emanating from the genome will play a role in transcriptional processes. We intend to identify and characterise such ncRNAs. This will take place in two phases. In the first phase we will use biochemical approaches to identify ncRNAs involved in the regulation of chromatin and transcription. Our investigations will focus on proteins leading to the induction of pluripotency and oncogenesis. ncRNAs associated with such proteins will be identified using targeted screens. In the second phase, the importance of these RNAs in determining pluripotency and oncogenesis will be analysed.  In addition, a variety of molecular approaches will be used to investigate the mechanism by which these ncRNAs regulate the function of the proteins or complexes they associate with. One particular hypothesis we will explore is that such ncRNAs play a role in guiding proteins to DNA sequences, via the formation of RNA/DNA triplexes. This concerted and focused analysis will provide mechanistic insights into the functions of ncRNAs in transcriptional regulation and validate their role in key biological processes. The identification of such new ncRNA-regulated pathways may open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,141,470</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CRYOTRANSLATION"><Rcn>103383</Rcn><Nid>12492</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>High Resolution cryo-EM Analysis of Ribosome-associated Functions</Name><PI>Roland Beckmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Translation of the genetically encoded information into polypeptides, protein biosynthesis, is a central function executed by ribosomes in all cells. In the case of membrane protein synthesis, integration into the membrane usually occurs co-translationally and requires a ribosome-associated translocon (SecYEG/Sec61). This highly coordinated process is poorly understood, since high-resolution structural information is lacking. Although single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has given invaluable structural insights for such dynamic ribosomal complexes, the resolution is so far limited to 5-10 &#195;&#133; for asymmetrical particles. Thus, the mechanistic depth and reliability of interpretation has accordingly been limited.
Here, I propose to use single particle cryo-EM at improved, molecular resolution of 3-4 &#195;&#133; to study two fundamental ribosome-associated processes:
(i) co-translational integration of polytopic membrane proteins and
(ii) recycling of the eukaryotic ribosome.
First, we will visualize nascent polytopic membrane proteins inserting into the lipid bilayer via the bacterial ribosome-bound SecYEG translocon. Notably, the translocon will be embedded in a lipid environment provided by so-called nanodiscs. Second, we will visualize in a similar approach membrane protein insertion via the YidC insertase, the main alternative translocon. Third, as a novel research direction, we will determine the structure and function of eukaryotic ribosome recycling complexes involving the ABC-ATPase RLI.
The results will allow, together with functional biochemical data, an in-depth molecular structure-function analysis of these fundamental ribosome-associated processes. Moreover, reaching molecular resolution for asymmetrical particles by single particle cryo-EM will lift this technology to a level of analytical power approaching X-ray and NMR methods.

Changes in the ion homeostasis and volume of cells and organelles may in turn influence processes like cell division and migration or the budding of vesicles from cellular membranes. Volume changes of cells, and possibly also of intracellular organelles, in turn regulate ion transport across their membranes. Whereas several swelling-activated plasma membrane ion transporters and channels are known, the molecular identity of a key player, the swelling-activated anion channel VRAC, and its impact on cellular functions remain elusive. Only sketchy information is available on ion homeostasis and volume regulation of intracellular organelles like endosomes and lysosomes, in spite of their importance for several diseases.
We propose to perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to finally identify the long-sought swelling-activated Cl- channel VRAC at the molecular level. This screen will also identify genes involved in the regulation of VRAC. The network involved in cell volume regulation will be investigated at the structural, biochemical and cellular level as well as with genetically modified mice. In parallel we will examine the ion homeostasis of endosomes and lysosomes. Until recently only the regulation of luminal H+ and Ca++ concentration was studied, but our recent work demonstrated a crucial role of luminal Cl- and hinted at an important role of cations. A combination of proteomics, siRNA screens, candidate approaches, and mouse models will be used to elucidate the ion homeostasis of endosomes/lysosomes and the impact on organellar function and associated pathologies. We expect that our work will break new ground in ion transport physiology, pathology, and cell biology."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Carnivorom"><Rcn>93943</Rcn><Nid>10034</Nid><HI>Julius-Maximilians Universitaet Wuerzburg, Germany</HI><Name>Molecular basis of carnivory Excitability, movement, and endocrinology of plant traps</Name><PI>Rainer Franz Hedrich</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Predation plays a major role in energy and nutrient flow in the biological food chain. Carnivory is best known from the animal kingdom, but the plant kingdom has flesh eaters as well. This field has attracted much interest since Darwin s time, but many fundamental properties of the carnivorous life style remain largely unexplored. This project will close this gap by a multidisciplinary approach based on state-of-art bioinformatics, molecular biology, chemistry and biophysics. It will focus on 1. Genome/Transcriptome Profiling to study the genetic make-up of carnivorous plants (CPs) and the evolution of carnivory 2. Origin of Excitability to investigate whether CPs gained the inventory to fire action potentials from captured animals or rather evolved excitability independently 3. Prey Recognition on the basis of mechanical- and chemical senses 4. Endocrinology Structure and function of exocrine glands - CPs offer a unique system to study the biology of digestive glands (exo-/endocytosis) in plants. Over 600 plant species use special structures to capture animals such as insects. The genome/transcriptome of major trap types such as snap traps, tentacles traps, suction traps, corkscrew traps, and pitfall traps will be compared and trap-specific genes identified. Among them those giving rise to membrane excitation, excitation-contraction coupling and exocrine systems (glands) will be functionally characterized in detail. Using loss-of-function mutants and transformed plants with respect to CP-specific the role of CP-specific in electrical signalling, excitation contraction coupling, and excretion will be unravelled. The evolution of electrical activity and carnivory of plants is worth being examined not only for its importance in general, but also as a model for understanding the evolution of the human nervous and endocrine system.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,481,057</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CarnoMorph"><Rcn>107247</Rcn><Nid>9459</Nid><HI>John Innes Centre, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Evolution and Development of Complex Morphologies</Name><PI>Enrico Coen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Plant and animal organs display a remarkable diversity of shapes.  A major challenge in developmental and evolutionary biology is to understand how this diversity of forms is generated.  Recent advances in imaging, computational modelling and genomics now make it possible to address this challenge effectively for the first time.  Leaf development is a particularly tractable system because of its accessibility to imaging and preservation of connectivity during growth.  Leaves also display remarkable diversity in shape and form, with perhaps the most complex form being the pitcher-shaped (epiascidiate) leaves of carnivorous plants.  This form has evolved four times independently, raising the question of whether its seeming complexity may have arisen through simple modulations in underlying morphogenetic mechanisms.  To test this hypothesis, I aim to develop a model system for carnivorous plants based on Utricularia gibba (humped bladderwort), which has the advantage of having one of the smallest genomes known in plants (~2/3 the size of the Arabidopsis genome) and small transparent pitcher-shaped leaves amenable to imaging.  I will use this system to define the morphogenetic events underlying the formation of pitcher-shaped leaves and their molecular genetic control.  I will also develop and apply computational modelling to explore hypotheses that may account for the development of U. gibba bladders and further test these hypotheses experimentally.  In addition, I will investigate the relationship between U. gibba bladder development and species with simpler leaf shapes, such as Arabidopsis, or species where the epiascidiate form has evolved independently.  Taken together, these studies should show how developmental rules elucidated in current model systems might be extended and built upon to account for the diversity and complexity of tissue forms, integrating evo-devo approaches with a mechanistic understanding of morphogenesis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,997</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Celcelfus"><Rcn>192383</Rcn><Nid>13468</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Cell-Cell fusion in fertilization and developmental biology: a structural biology approach</Name><PI>F&#195;&#169;lix A.

This aim of this ERC grant proposal is to achieve similar breakthroughs in understanding fusion between cells, both during fertilization and organogenesis. This proposal is based in recent important results not yet published.

We have determined the crystal structure of the C. elegans protein EFF-1, a member of the &#226;&#128;&#156;fusion family&#226;&#128;&#157; (FF). EFF-1 is responsible for a cell-cell fusion event during skin formation in the nematode. Strikingly, the crystal structure shows that EFF-1 is homologous to the &#226;&#128;&#156;Class II&#226;&#128;&#157; viral protein fusogens, thus indicating that they have diverged from a common ancestor. The observed homology could not be identified by other means because the proteins have diverged to the point where no remnants of sequence similarity are left, yet the tertiary and quaternary organization is the same. However, the homotypic fusion mechanism of EFF-1 is clearly different to that of viral fusion proteins.

This proposal intends to build on the momentum generated by this exciting discovery, in an attempt to cast light into the fusion mechanism of FF proteins. We will reconstitute them in artificial liposomes and will also follow them within cells with the use of light microscopy. We will also focus in determining the crystal structure of the monomeric pre-fusion form of EFF-1,and of the intact trans-membrane post fusion trimer. In parallel, we want to make use the experience accumulated over the years in crystallizing viral glycoproteins, to apply it to the conserved family of HAP2/GSC1 proteins involved in fusion of gametes during fertilization. These proteins exhibit a similar pattern of secondary structure elements in the ectodomain as class II proteins, but only a crystallographic analysis can identify a possible structural homology and provide the basis to understand the molecular mechanisms of cell-cell fusion.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,478,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CellDoctor"><Rcn>90074</Rcn><Nid>10023</Nid><HI>Fundacio Centre De Regulacio Genomica, Spain</HI><Name>Quantitative understanding of a living system and its engineering as a cellular organelle</Name><PI>Luis Serrano</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The idea of harnessing living organisms for treating human diseases is not new but, so far, the majority of the living vectors used in human therapy are viruses which have the disadvantage of the limited number of genes and networks that can contain. Bacteria allow the cloning of complex networks and the possibility of making a large plethora of compounds, naturally or through careful redesign. One of the main limitations for the use of bacteria to treat human diseases is their complexity, the existence of a cell wall that difficult the communication with the target cells, the lack of control over its growth and the immune response that will elicit on its target. Ideally one would like to have a very small bacterium (of a mitochondria size), with no cell wall, which could be grown in Vitro, be genetically manipulated, for which we will have enough data to allow a complete understanding of its behaviour and which could live as a human cell parasite. Such a microorganism could in principle be used as a living vector in which genes of interests, or networks producing organic molecules of medical relevance, could be introduced under in Vitro conditions and then inoculated on extracted human cells or in the organism, and then become a new organelle in the host. Then, it could produce and secrete into the host proteins which will be needed to correct a genetic disease, or drugs needed by the patient. To do that, we need to understand in excruciating detail the Biology of the target bacterium and how to interface with the host cell cycle (Systems biology aspect). Then we need to have engineering tools (network design, protein design, simulations) to modify the target bacterium to behave like an organelle once inside the cell (Synthetic biology aspect). M.pneumoniae could be such a bacterium. It is one of the smallest free-living bacterium known (680 genes), has no cell wall, can be cultivated in Vitro, can be genetically manipulated and can enter inside human cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,400,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CellMig"><Rcn>98993</Rcn><Nid>8745</Nid><HI>Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster, Germany</HI><Name>Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms Promoting Single-Cell Migration in vivo</Name><PI>Erez Raz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The regulation of cell migration is central in pattern formation, homeostasis and disease. The proposed research is aimed at investigating the molecular basis for cell motility and the associated polarization of the cell. In view of the dynamic nature of these processes, we have chosen to utilize the migration of Primoridal Germ Cells (PGCs) in zebrafish - a model that offers unique experimental advantages for imaging and experimental manipulations. The fact that molecules facilitating the motility of zebrafish PGCs are evolutionary conserved and the finding that the cells are directed by chemokines, molecules that control a wide range of cell trafficking events in vertebrates, make this in vivo study of particular importance.
The proposed work involves both the functional analysis of previously identified candidates and the identification of molecules, which have a presently unknown effect on the migration process. For both objectives, we will employ novel experimental schemes. We will examine the role of proteins in achieving functional cell polarity compatible with efficient motility and response to directional cues, using unique techniques and analysis tools in the context of the living organism. The precise function of the identified proteins will be determined by combining mathematical tools aimed at quantitatively gauging the role of the molecules in conferring proper cell shape, biophysical methods aimed at measuring forces, rigidity and cytoplasm flow and determination of the effect on the organization of relevant structures using cryo electron tomography.
Together, this approach would provide a non-conventional understanding of cell migration by correlating structural, morphological and dynamic cellular properties with the ability of cells to effectively migrate towards their target.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,960,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="CelluFuel"><Rcn>102524</Rcn><Nid>9172</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Designer Cellulosomes by Single Molecule Cut &amp; Paste</Name><PI>Hermann Eduard Gaub</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Biofuel from wood and waste will be a substantial share of our future energy mix.

Recently, the new concept was introduced that the vagus nerve plays an important role in modulating immune homeostasis as part of a so-called inflammatory reflex. We provided evidence for this concept in the gastrointestinal tract and showed that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduced inflammation of the intestinal muscle layer. Moreover, we showed that this effect was mediated by activation of enteric cholinergic neurons (cholinergic tone) interacting with intestinal macrophages in the muscle layer. Of interest, we have collected exciting data that the vagus nerve (and thus the cholinergic tone) also significantly contributes to mucosal immune homeostasis. Mice that underwent vagotomy lost their ability to develop tolerance to oral feeding of an antigen, whereas VNS reduced mucosal inflammation in a model of food allergy. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the cholinergic tone is a major determinant of the tolerogenic microenvironment of the mucosal immune system, and want to further explore the immune-modulatory effect of the vagal innervation and enteric neurons on the macrophages residing in the lamina propria. In addition, we will further explore the therapeutic potential and the mechanisms involved of chronic VNS in colitis and food allergy. Finally, we will translate our preclinical findings to the human situation. The anti-inflammatory effect of VNS (applied during surgery) will be studied in human intestinal tissue whereas the therapeutic potential of chronic VNS in Crohn&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease will be studied in a pilot trial.
The outcome of this project will be ground-breaking and will have an immense impact on clinical management as it will provide new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ChroNeuroRepair"><Rcn>110494</Rcn><Nid>10205</Nid><HI>Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Deutsches Forschungszentrum Fuer Gesundheit Und Umwelt (Gmbh), Germany</HI><Name>Chromatin states in neurogenesis &#226;&#128;&#147; from understanding chromatin loops to eliciting neurogenesis for repair</Name><PI>Magdalena G&#195;&#182;tz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The mechanisms regulating neural stem cells and their progression to neurogenesis are important not only to understand brain development and evolution, but also to elicit neurogenesis after brain injury. Our recent findings imply novel chromatin-associated proteins in the regulation of neural stem cell fate and neurogenesis. Therefore this project aims to understand the molecular mechanisms of how these factors regulate neurogenesis in developing and adult mice (Aim1) and implement this knowledge for reprogramming glia into neurons after brain injury (Aim2). This will be pursued in mouse models in vivo (2.1) and with human glial cells derived from patient brain resections in vitro (2.2). It is well known that transcription factors need to alter the chromatin structure to achieve transcriptional regulation, but the factors involved in this regulation in neural stem and progenitor cells are still ill understood. Therefore the molecular function of the novel chromatin interacting protein Trnp1 with essential roles in neural stem cell (NSC) fate and the chromatin conformation mediated at neurogenic target genes by Pax6/Brg1-containing BAF complexes will be addressed in Aim1. Combined with genome-wide approaches to determine changes in chromatin conformation at neurogenic target gene sites this will greatly further our understanding of key roles of chromatin conformation in neural stem cells and neurogenesis. In Aim2 Trnp1 promoting neural stem cells fate and later acting neurogenic transcription factors will be used to improve neuronal reprogramming after stab wound injury in the murine brain in vivo and in patient-derived glial cells in vitro. Together with novel strategies to induce chromatin looping in a sequence-specific manner this project will not only advance our knowledge at the frontier of transcriptional regulation in neurogenesis, but also implement highly innovative approaches to utilize this knowledge for neuronal repair by direct reprogramming.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,376,560</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ClockworkGreen"><Rcn>102226</Rcn><Nid>10399</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Ecological performance of arrhythmic plants in nature</Name><PI>Ian Thomas Baldwin</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Timing is everything in ecology, and because plants provide the foundation for most land-based food webs, the timing of their activities profoundly orchestrates the majority of ecological interactions. Most photosynthetic and growth processes are under circadian control, but many additional processes--approximately 30-40% of all genes&#226;&#128;&#148;are under circadian control, and yet the Darwinian fitness impact of being &#226;&#128;&#156;in synch&#226;&#128;&#157; with the environment has not been systematically studied for any organism.

We have developed a toolbox for a native tobacco plant, Nicotiana attenuata, that allows us to &#226;&#128;&#156;ask the plant&#226;&#128;&#157; which genes, proteins or metabolites are regulated in particular plant-mediated ecological interactions; identify &#226;&#128;&#156;the genes that matter&#226;&#128;&#157; for a given interaction; silence or ectopically express these genes, and conduct field releases with the transformed plants at a nature preserve in the Great Basin Desert to rigorously test hypotheses of gene function. By taking advantage of both our understanding of what it takes for this plant to survive in nature, and the procedures established to disentangle the skein of subtle interactions that determine its performance, we will systematically examine the importance of synchronous entrained endogenous rhythms at all life stages: longevity in the seed bank, germination, rosette growth, elongation, flowering and senescence. Specifically, we propose to silence a key components (starting with NaTOC1) of the plant&#226;&#128;&#153;s endogenous clock to shorten the plant&#226;&#128;&#153;s circadian rhythm, both constitutively and with strong dexamethasone-inducible promoters, at all life stages. With a combination of real-time phenotype imaging, metabolite and transcriptome analysis, and ecological know-how, the research will reveal how plants adjust their physiologies to the ever-changing panoply of environmental stresses with which they must cope; by creating arrhythmic plants, we will understand why so many processes are under circadian control.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,002</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Cohesin control"><Rcn>103298</Rcn><Nid>9251</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The mechanism by which cohesin controls gene expression</Name><PI>Kim Ashley Nasmyth</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>How cells retain, lose, and regain developmental plasticity is poorly understood due to ignorance of the molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression. Each gene is regulated by a unique set of factors and as a consequence the trans-acting factors and cis-acting chromatin modification states regulating a given gene are extremely rare. Transcription is affected by events taking place many thousands of base pairs away from the start, a property enabling developmental and evolutionary plasticity, presumably made possible by DNA looping or translocation of factors along chromatin. Most factors regulating a given gene function at many other genes, complicating interpretation of the consequences of altering the activity of such factors. It is difficult to exclude the possibility that phenotypes are knock-on effects. This could be surmounted if it were possible to observe individual genes in real time in three-dimensional space and to analyse the immediate consequences of altering the activity of regulatory factors. Of these, those capable of inter-connecting DNAs or of translocating large distances along chromatin are of interest. Cohesin is such a factor, composed of three core subunits, a pair of Smc proteins and a kleisin subunit, that interact with each other to form a huge tripartite ring, within which it is thought chromatin fibres are entrapped. In proliferating cells, cohesin&#226;&#128;&#153;s primary function is to connect sister chromatids during DNA replication until the onset of anaphase, possibly by virtue of co-entrapment within a single ring.  However, cohesin is present in most quiescent cells and it is becoming clear that it also regulates gene expression and recombination. This proposal has two goals: To image gene expression on polytene chromosomes and to investigate cohesin&#226;&#128;&#153;s role during ecdysone-induced transcription.

We present a novel and interdisciplinary programme of research to address this problem by empirically testing assumptions and predictions of several leading explanations for cooperation. We will develop theory to make explicit testable predictions for specific systems. We will exploit the advantage offered by different study systems: experiments with bacteria, comparative studies on cooperative breeding vertebrates, and experiments on humans.

Thus, physiological signaling from cytokines occurs primarily when the cytokines are interacting with the ECM. In therapeutic use of cytokines, however, this interaction and balance have not been respected; rather the growth factors are merely injected or applied as soluble molecules, perhaps in controlled release forms. This has led to modest efficacy and substantial concerns on safety. Here, we will develop a protein engineering design for second-generation cytokines to lead to their super-affinity binding to ECM molecules in the targeted tissues; this would allow application to a tissue site to yield a tight association with ECM molecules there, turning the tissue itself into a reservoir for cytokine sequestration and presentation. To accomplish this, we have undertaken preliminary work screening a library of cytokines for extraordinarily high affinity binding to a library of ECM molecules. We have thereby identified a small peptide domain within placental growth factor-2 (PlGF-2), namely PlGF-2123-144, that displays super-affinity for a number of ECM proteins. Also in preliminary work, we have demonstrated that recombinant fusion of this domain to low-affinity binding cytokines, namely VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and BMP-2, confers super-affinity binding to ECM molecules and accentuates their functionality in vivo in regenerative medicine models. In the proposed project, based on this preliminary data, we will push forward this protein engineering design, pursuing super-affinity variants of VEGF-A and PDGF-BB in chronic wounds, TGF-beta3 and CXCL11 in skin scar reduction, FGF-18 in osteoarthritic cartilage repair and CXCL12 in stem cell recruitment to ischemic cardiac muscle.

Patients with NER defects present a perplexing clinical heterogeneity ranging from extreme cancer predisposition to dramatic neurodevelopmental deficits. To elucidate the underlying mechanism we adopted an integral strategy from gene to patient and contributed to resolving the NER reaction in vitro and its dynamic organization in vivo, using molecular genetics, advanced life cell imaging and photobleaching. Mouse NER mutants revealed an unexpected link between DNA damage and (premature) aging, as strong as the DNA damage-cancer connection. We found a striking correlation between type/severity of the repair defect and degree of premature aging, with some mutants dying of aging in 3 weeks! Pathological and functional analysis and expression profiling confirmed that this is bona fide aging. Conditional mutants allowed targeting accelerated aging to specific organs/stages of development e.g. dramatic aging only in brain. Expression profiling revealed that short-lived repair mutants mount a  survival response  that attempts to extend lifespan by investing in defenses at the expense of growth. The ambitious objective of this multi-disciplinary proposal is to obtain an integral understanding of the biological/medical impact of DNA damage and the important survival response, with emphasis on rational-based prevention and intervention strategies for cancer and other aging-related diseases using the rapidly aging mouse mutants as tools. Triggering the  survival  response at adulthood is expected to postpone many aging-related diseases including cancer and to strongly improve quality of life at later age. We already identified compounds that influence rapid aging in mice and demonstrated the potency of the survival response to withstand ischemia reperfusion damage. Thus, this proposal addresses the major medical challenges faced by our society.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DAMAGE BYPASS"><Rcn>107011</Rcn><Nid>10894</Nid><HI>Institut Fur Molekulare Biologie Ggmbh, Germany</HI><Name>Mechanistic analysis of DNA damage bypass in the context of chromatin and genome replication</Name><PI>Helle Doerte Ulrich</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>During its duplication, DNA, the carrier of our genetic information, is particularly vulnerable to decay, and the capacity of cells to deal with replication stress has been recognised as a major factor protecting us from genome instability and cancer. A major pathway that allows cells to overcome or bypass DNA lesions during replication is activated by posttranslational modifications of the sliding clamp protein PCNA. Whereas monoubiquitylation of PCNA allows mutagenic translesion synthesis by damage-tolerant DNA polymerases, polyubiquitylation is required for an error-free pathway that involves template switching to the undamaged sister chromatid, involving a recombination-like mechanism. Hence, damage bypass contributes to genome maintenance, but can itself be a source of genomic instability. It is therefore not surprising that PRR is a highly regulated process whose activity is limited to the appropriate situations by stringent control mechanisms.
The proposed project aims at understanding DNA damage bypass in its cellular context. Using a combination of new and established technology, we will address the role of chromatin dynamics in the reaction, its spatial and temporal control in relation to genome replication, and its coordination with other PCNA-dependent processes in the cell. To this end, we will establish technology to isolate and analyse the composition of damage bypass tracts, develop and implement novel methods to induce lesions and image damage processing in live cells, and exploit a spectrum of biochemical and biophysical techniques to investigate the role of PCNA as a molecular tool-belt in the coordination of its interaction partners. In combination, these approaches will give important insight into how the replication of damaged DNA is managed with high efficiency and accuracy within the cell.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,476,388</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DAMAGECONTROL"><Rcn>102989</Rcn><Nid>10335</Nid><HI>Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, Portugal</HI><Name>Tissue Damage Control Regulates The Pathogenesis of Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases</Name><PI>Miguel Parreira Soares</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"We propose to study evolutionarily conserved stress-responsive protective mechanisms that limit the extent of tissue damage caused by pathogens or by the innate as well as adaptive immune response elicited by those pathogens, which, without a countervailing response would lead to irreversible tissue damage and disease. We refer to these protective mechanisms as &#226;&#128;&#156;tissue damage control&#226;&#128;&#157;, and will argue they are an essential component of immunity that allows the effector mechanisms involved in pathogen clearance to operate without causing disease. This proposal aims at identifying and characterizing the mechanism of action of stress-induced genetic programs conferring tissue damage control and to relate those to the pathogenesis of different immune mediated inflammatory diseases. We hypothesize that these genetic programs share as a common denominator their regulation by a restricted number of evolutionary conserved transcription factors that act as &#226;&#128;&#156;master regulators&#226;&#128;&#157; of different protective responses to specific forms of stress.

The mutation rate reflects the equilibrium between the need to adapt, the burden of mutation load, the &#226;&#128;&#156;cost of fidelity&#226;&#128;&#157;, and random drift that determines a lower limit in achievable fidelity. Recombination fulfills an essential mechanistic role during meiosis, ensuring proper chromosomal segregation.  Recombination affects the rate of creation and loss of favorable haplotypes, imposing 2nd-order selection pressure on modifiers of recombination.

It is becoming apparent that recombination and mutation rates vary between individuals, and that these differences are in part inherited.  Both processes are therefore &#226;&#128;&#156;evolvable&#226;&#128;&#157;, and amenable to genomic analysis.  Identifying genetic determinants underlying these differences will provide insights in the regulation of mutation and recombination. The mutational load, and in particular the number of lethal equivalents per individual, remains poorly defined as epidemiological and molecular data yield estimates that differ by one order of magnitude. A relationship between recombination and fertility has been reported in women but awaits confirmation.

Population structure (small effective population size; large harems), phenotypic data collection (systematic recording of &gt; 50 traits on millions of cows), and large-scale SNP genotyping (for genomic selection), make cattle populations uniquely suited for genetic analysis. DAMONA proposes to exploit these unique resources, combined with recent advances in next generation sequencing and genotyping, to:

(i) quantify and characterize inter-individual variation in male and female mutation and recombination rates,
(ii) map, fine-map and identify causative genes underlying QTL for these four phenotypes,
(iii) test the effect of loss-of-function variants on &gt;50 traits including fertility, and

In comparison, we know almost nothing about the origins and mechanisms of the functional dark matter , including sequence that is transcribed outside of protein-coding gene loci. This interdisciplinary proposal will capitalize on new theoretical and experimental opportunities to establish the extent by which long non-coding RNAs contribute to mammalian and fruit fly biology. Since 2001, the Ponting group has pioneered the comparative analysis of protein-coding genes across the amniotes and Drosophilids within many international genome sequencing consortia. This Advanced Grant will break new ground by applying these approaches to long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes from mammals to birds and to flies. The Grant will allow Ponting to free himself of the constraints normally associated with in silico analyses by analysing lincRNAs in vitro and in vivo. The integration of computational and experimental approaches for lincRNAs from across the metazoan tree provides a powerful new toolkit for elucidating the origins and biological roles of these enigmatic molecules. Catalogues of lincRNA loci will be built for human, mouse, fruit fly, zebrafinch, chicken and Aplysia by exploiting data from next-generation sequencing technologies. This will immediately provide a new perspective on how these loci arise, evolve and function, including whether their orthologues are apparent across diverse species. Using new evidence that lincRNA loci act in cis with neighbouring protein-coding loci, we will determine lincRNA mechanisms and will establish the consequences of lincRNA knock-down, knock-out and over-expression in mouse, chick and fruitfly.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,400,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DCBIOX"><Rcn>191990</Rcn><Nid>11224</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Phagosome functions and antigen cross presentation in primary dendritic cells</Name><PI>Sebastian Amigorena</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"T cell cross priming (the initiation of CD8+ T cell responses to antigen that are not expressed by dendritic cells, DCs) requires the phagocytosis of antigens by DCs and their presentation on MHC class I molecules, a process referred to as &#226;&#128;&#156;cross presentation&#226;&#128;&#157;. Here, we propose a series of integrated approaches to address the most fundamental mechanisms of cross presentation and explore the use of this process for translational purposes in human cancer.

This proposal will pursue three main objectives:
1)	To analyze the mechanisms of control of antigen cross presentation and phagocytic functions in DCs. We will use genome wide screens and conditional KO mice, associated to quantitative assays for phagosomal functions and cross presentation, to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cross presentation in vitro and in vivo.
2)	To study the epigenetic programing of cross presentation during the ontogeny of mouse DC subpopulations. We will define a &#226;&#128;&#156;cross presentation gene signature&#226;&#128;&#157; that will be validated by systematic gene silencing in vitro and we will analyze the epigenetic basis of control of cross presentation-related genes developing DCs.
3)	To investigate the regulation of cross presentation in human primary DCs and to develop translational approaches in cancer. We will study cross presentation and phagosome functions in primary human DC subpopulations and its regulation by innate receptors for the development of original immunomodulation and vaccination strategies. We will explore the use of DCs cross presentation abilities in solid tumor infiltrating DCs and their use for prognosis in cancer.

The results of this project will unravel fundamental mechanisms of phagocytosis and its control by innate signals in mice and humans.

Little is known about the role of distinct DC subtypes in vivo. In the mouse, a subset known as CD8alpha+ DC has been argued to represent a discrete DC lineage with specialised properties. These include a superior capacity for presenting exogenous antigens to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, which makes CD8alpha+  DC an attractive target in vaccination and tolerisation. However, it is unclear whether CD8alpha+ DC fulfill unique and non-redundant roles in the immune system. In addition, the reported restriction of CD8alpha+ DC to thymus and secondary lymphoid organs is hard to reconcile with their documented capacity to act as presenting cells for antigens outside those organs. Finally, CD8alpha+ DC have not been identified in humans, greatly restricting their use in immunotherapy. In this proposal, we exploit the recent finding that DNGR-1 (CLEC9A) acts as a new and specific marker for the CD8alpha+ lineage to address these issues. We will generate DNGR-1-Cre mice as a universal tool to manipulate gene expression in the subset. We will use such mice to render CD8alpha+  DC sensitive to toxic proteins that permit constitutive or transient ablation of the subset for functional studies. DNGR-1-Cre mice will further be used to express fluorescent proteins in CD8alpha+ DC, allowing tracing of the lineage in vivo, both in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. Finally, we will use the DNGR-1 marker to identify and characterise putative CD8alpha+ DC equivalents in humans. The results from this proposal will illuminate the function of CD8alpha+  DC across species and open the door for using this intriguing DC subset in immunotherapy of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,998</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DCVfusion"><Rcn>107066</Rcn><Nid>12864</Nid><HI>Stichting Vu, Netherlands</HI><Name>Telling the full story: how neurons send other signals than by classical synaptic transmission</Name><PI>Matthijs Verhage</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The regulated secretion of chemical signals in the brain occurs principally from two organelles, synaptic vesicles and dense core vesicles (DCVs). Synaptic vesicle secretion accounts for the well characterized local, fast signalling in synapses. DCVs contain a diverse collection of cargo, including many neuropeptides that trigger a multitude of modulatory effects with quite robust impact, for instance on memory, mood, pain, appetite or social behavior. Disregulation of neuropeptide secretion is firmly associated with many diseases such as cognitive and mood disorders, obesity and diabetes. In addition, many other signals depend on DCVs, for instance trophic factors and proteolytic enzymes, but also signals that typically do not diffuse like guidance cues and pre-assembled active zones. Hence, it is beyond doubt that DCV signalling is a central factor in brain communication. However, many fundamental questions remain open on DCV trafficking and secretion. Therefore, the aim of this proposal is to characterize the molecular principles that account for DCV delivery at release sites and their secretion. I will address 4 fundamental questions: What are the molecular factors that drive DCV fusion in mammalian CNS neurons? How does Ca2+ trigger DCV fusion? What are the requirements of DCV release sites and where do they occur? Can DCV fusion be targeted to synthetic release sites in vivo? I will exploit &gt;30 mutant mouse lines and new cell biological and photonic approaches that allow for the first time a quantitative assessment of DCV-trafficking and fusion of many cargo types, in living neurons with a single vesicle resolution. Preliminary data suggest that DCV secretion is quite different from synaptic vesicle and chromaffin granule secretion. Together, these studies will produce the first systematic evaluation of the molecular identity of the core machinery that drives DCV fusion in neurons, the Ca2+-affinity of DCV fusion and the characteristics of DCV release sites.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,439,315</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DDRNA"><Rcn>108775</Rcn><Nid>10325</Nid><HI>Ifom Fondazione Istituto Firc Di Oncologia Molecolare, Italy</HI><Name>A novel direct role of non coding RNA in DNA damage response activation</Name><PI>Fabrizio D'adda Di Fagagna</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA, if damaged, cannot be replaced. If not replaceable, it must be repaired. The so-called &#226;&#128;&#156;DNA damage response&#226;&#128;&#157; (DDR) is a coordinate set of evolutionary conserved events that arrest the cell-cycle (DNA damage checkpoint function) in proliferating cells and attempts DNA repair. Until DNA damage has not been repaired in full, cell proliferation is not resumed in normal cells.
DNA damage is a physiological event. Ageing and cancer are both associated with DNA damage accumulation. In the past, we contribute to better understand the mechanisms and the consequences of DNA damage generation and DDR activation in both settings.

We have recently identified a completely hitherto undiscovered level of control of DDR activation, so far considered a proteinaceous only signaling cascade. We have discovered that short RNA species are detectable at DNA damage sites and are necessary for DDR activation at DNA lesions. These RNA species are generated by an evolutionary-conserved RNA processing machinery. However, they serve purposes never reported before.
We believe that our findings change radically our understanding of DDR modulation in mammals and disclose a fertile unspoilt ground for exciting investigations."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,329,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DDRREAM"><Rcn>98948</Rcn><Nid>8815</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>DNA-Damage responses: Regulation and mechanisms</Name><PI>Stephen Philip Jackson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The prime objective for every life form is to deliver its genetic material, intact, to the next generation. Each human cell receives tens-of-thousands of DNA lesions per day. These lesions can block genome replication and transcription, and if not repaired or repaired incorrectly, they lead to mutations or wider genome aberrations that threaten cell viability. To counter such threats, life has evolved the DNA-damage response (DDR), to detect DNA damage, signal its presence and mediate its repair. DDR events impact on many cellular processes and, crucially, prevent diverse human diseases that include cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, immune-deficiencies and premature ageing. While much progress has been made in identifying DDR proteins, much remains to be learned about the molecular and cellular functions that they control. Furthermore, the frequent reporting of new DDR proteins in the literature suggests that many others await identification. The main goals for the proposed research are to: identify important new DDR-proteins and DDR-modulators, particularly those responding to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); provide mechanistic insights into how these proteins function; and determine how DDR events are affected by chromatin structure, by molecular chaperones and components of the Ubiquitin and Sumo systems. To achieve these ends, we will use molecular biology, biochemical, cell-biology and molecular genetics approaches, including synthetic-lethal and phenotypic-suppression screening methods in human cells and in the nematode worm.

Modulation of the half-life of mRNAs via their degradation is a powerful and versatile mechanism to swiftly alter the expression of proteins in response to changes in physiological conditions. The decay of mRNAs is performed by a set of macromolecular complexes that act in a sequential and coordinated manner, progressively eroding the ends of the transcript until its degradation is complete. These macromolecular assemblies contain only a few catalytically active subunits and a large number of regulatory components. How and why the activities are regulated within the architecture of the complexes is largely unknown. Also unclear are the mechanisms with which the complexes communicate with each other and/or with the changing composition of the nucleic acid. In this project, we will reconstitute the key protein complexes in mRNA decay from recombinant proteins in vitro. Specifically, we will focus on the evolutionary conserved deadenylation, decapping and exosome-Ski complexes. The reconstituted complexes will be used for structural studies to derive atomic models of the holoenzymes using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy. In parallel to obtaining static views of the individual steps in the pathway, we will establish the assays to study how information from one processing step is passed on to the next in a dynamic manner. We will address the basis for the timing and interrelationship of the conserved enzymatic machineries and the influence of the mRNP composition on their activity. Our final goal is to recapitulate the complex behavior of the mRNA decay pathway in vitro.

Additionally, under some conditions, autophagy, whose function is mainly pro-survival, may act as a back-up death pathway. We propose to apply new approaches to study the molecular basis of two important questions that await resolution in the field: a) how the cell switches from a pro-survival autophagic response to an apoptotic response and b) whether and how pro-survival autophagy is converted to a death mechanism when apoptosis is blocked. To address the first issue, we will screen for direct physical interactions between autophagic and apoptotic proteins, using the protein fragment complementation assay. Validated pairs will be studied in depth to identify built-in molecular switches that activate apoptosis when autophagy fails to restore homeostasis. As a pilot case to address the concept of molecular &#226;&#128;&#152;sensors&#226;&#128;&#153; and &#226;&#128;&#152;switches&#226;&#128;&#153;, we will focus on the previously identified Atg12/Bcl-2 interaction. In the second line of research we will categorize autophagy-dependent cell death triggers into those that directly result from autophagy-dependent degradation, either by excessive self-digestion or by selective protein degradation, and those that utilize the autophagy machinery to activate programmed necrosis. We will identify the genes regulating these scenarios by whole genome RNAi screens for increased cell survival. In parallel, we will use a cell library of annotated fluorescent-tagged proteins for measuring selective protein degradation. These will be the starting point for identification of the molecular pathways that convert survival autophagy to a death program. Finally, we will explore the physiological relevance of back-up death mechanisms and the newly identified molecular mechanisms to developmental PCD during the cavitation process in early stages of embryogenesis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DECRYPT"><Rcn>185412</Rcn><Nid>12363</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Decrypting signals in the crypt</Name><PI>Philippe, Joseph Sansonetti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Pathogens and symbionts: War and Peace at mucosal surface in intestinal crypts.
In the proposed program called DECRYPT, I wish to strengthen novel orientations of our laboratory aimed at decrypting the dialogue between the microbiota and the host, while keeping a balance with the study of pathogens, both being analyzed at their interface with the gut mucosa to further our knowledge of the homeostatic and pathogenic mechanisms that respectively characterize a healthy and a diseased gut. The intestinal crypt is a key location to study this dialogue because it contains the stem cells, the differentiation and transit amplifying/proliferative compartments that are essential for epithelial regeneration at homeostasis, and restitution following an aggression. It is also embedded in a niche of immune cells that participate in homeostatic and pathological processes under microbial stimuli. Thus the breaking nature of my project will bear on the demonstration that crypt homeostasis depends on signals &#226;&#128;&#156;emitted&#226;&#128;&#157; by the microbiota, thereby stressing the depth of our symbiosis with the microbial world, and on the demonstration that the crypt is also the target of enteric pathogens like Shigella, thus introducing the novel paradigm that pathogenesis is not only matter of inflammatory destruction of infected tissues, but also of altered epithelial restitution. An extension of this paradigm is that loss or subversion of the microbiota-crypt homeostasis may account not only for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but also for colon cancer. This fundamental knowledge will also be the basis for translational research, particularly the search for molecules that boost antimicrobial defenses and comfort homeostasis.

Answering this question is crucial not only for understanding how the brain works, but also for building accurate models of brain function, which require abstraction based on identification of the essential elements for carrying out computations relevant to behaviour. We will directly test the possibility that single dendritic branches may act as individual computational units during behaviour, challenging the classical view that the neuron is the fundamental unit of computation. We will address this question using a combination of electrophysiological, anatomical, imaging, molecular, and modeling approaches to probe dendritic integration in pyramidal cells and Purkinje cells in mouse cortex and cerebellum. We will define the computational rules for integration of synaptic input in dendrites by examining the responses to different spatiotemporal patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We will use computational modeling to extract simple rules describing dendritic integration that captures the essence of the computation. Next, we will determine how these rules are engaged by patterns of sensory stimulation in vivo, by using various strategies to map the spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs to dendrites. To understand how physiological patterns of activity in the circuit engage these dendritic computations, we will use anatomical approaches to map the wiring diagram of synaptic inputs to individual dendrites. Finally, we will manipulate dendritic function using molecular tools, in order to provide causal links between specific dendritic computations and sensory processing. These experiments will provide us with deeper insights into how single neurons act as computing devices, and how fundamental computations that drive behaviour are implemented on the level of single cells and neural circuits.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,416,078</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DENOVOHSC"><Rcn>193000</Rcn><Nid>13656</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Blood regeneration: de novo development of human hematopoietic stem cells</Name><PI>Elaine Anne Dzierzak</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are used in clinical therapies for leukemia and blood-related genetic disorders.

In this proposal we aim to find novel principles on how circuits resist fluctuations and errors, and how they can be controlled by drugs: (1) Why do key regulatory systems use bifunctional enzymes that catalyze antagonistic reactions (e.g. both kinase and phosphatase)? We will test the role of bifunctional enzymes in making circuits robust to variations in protein levels. (2) Why are some genes regulated by a repressor and others by an activator? We will test this in the context of reduction of errors in transcription control. (3) Are there principles that describe how drugs combine to affect protein dynamics in human cells?

These receptors, named &#226;&#128;&#156;dependence receptors&#226;&#128;&#157; (DRs) share the ability to transmit two opposite signals: in the presence of ligand, these receptors transduce various classical &#226;&#128;&#156;positive&#226;&#128;&#157; signals, whereas in the absence of ligand, they trigger apoptosis. The expression of dependence receptors thus creates cellular states of dependence for survival on their respective ligands.  To date, more than fifteen such receptors have been identified, including the netrin-1 receptors DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) and UNC5H1-4, some integrins, RET, EPHA4, TrkA, TrkC and the Sonic Hedgehog receptor Patched (Ptc). Even though the interest in this notion is increasing, two main questions remain poorly understood: (i) how very different receptors, with only modest homology, are able to trigger apoptosis when unengaged by their respective ligand, and (ii) what are the respective biological roles of this pro-apoptotic activity in vivo. We have hypothesized that the DRs pro-apoptotic activity is a mechanism that determines and regulates the territories of migration/localization of cells during embryonic development. We also demonstrated that this may be a mechanism that limits tumor growth and metastasis. The goal of the present project is, based on the study of a relatively small number of these receptors &#226;&#128;&#147;i.e., DCC, UNC5H, RET, TrkC, Ptc- with a specifically larger emphasis on netrin-1 receptors, to address (i) the common and divergent cell signaling mechanisms triggering apoptosis downstream of these receptors and (ii) the physiological and pathological roles of these DRs on development of neoplasia in vivo.

Different cell states are identified by a vector in the differentiation hyperspace, the coordinates of the vector being the activation levels of a large number of nodes of a logic model linking the cell signalling network to the transcription regulatory network.
The premise of this proposal is that differentiation is equivalent to rewiring the cell regulatory network as a consequence of induced perturbation of the gene expression program. This process can be rationally controlled by perturbing specific nodes of the signalling network that in turn control transcription factor activation. We will develop this novel strategy using the mesoangioblast ex vivo differentiation system. Mesoangioblasts are one of the many different types of mesoderm stem/progenitor cells that exhibit myogenic potential. Ex vivo, they readily differentiate into striated muscle. However, under appropriate conditions they can also differentiate, into smooth muscle and adipocytes, albeit less efficiently. We will start by assembling, training and optimizing different predictive models for the undifferentiated mesoangioblast. Next by a combination of experiments and modelling approaches we will learn how, by perturbing the signalling models with different inhibitors and activators we can rewire the cell networks to induce trans-determination or reprogramming."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,639,804</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DEVOCHROMO"><Rcn>111608</Rcn><Nid>8726</Nid><HI>The Babraham Institute, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Chromosome structure and genome organization in early mammalian development</Name><PI>Peter Fraser</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The spatial organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus is tissue-specific and has been linked to several nuclear processes including gene activation, gene silencing, genomic imprinting, gene co-regulation, genome maintenance, DNA replication, DNA repair, chromosomal translocations and X chromosome inactivation. In fact, just about any nuclear/genome function has a spatial component that has been implicated in its control. We know surprisingly little about chromosome conformation and spatial organization or how they are established. The extent to which they are a cause or consequence of genome functions are current topics of considerable debate, however emerging data from my group and many other groups world-wide indicate that nuclear location and organization are drivers of genome functions, which in cooperation with other features including epigenetic marks, non-coding RNAs and trans-factor binding bring about genome control. Thus, genome spatial organization can be considered on a par with other epigenetic features that together contribute to overall genome control. The classical paradigm of early mammalian development arguably represents the most dramatic and yet least understood process of genome reprogramming, where a single cell undergoes a series of divisions to ultimately give rise to the hundreds of different cell types found in a mature organism. Study of pre-implantation embryo development is hindered by the very nature of the life form, composed of extremely low cell numbers at each stage, which severely limits the options for investigation. My lab has recently developed a novel technique called single cell Hi-C, which has the power to detect tens of thousands of simultaneous chromatin contacts from a single cell. In this application I propose to apply this technology to study chromosome structure and genome organization during mouse pre-implantation development along with single cell transcriptome analyses from the same cells."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,401,393</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DHISP"><Rcn>94222</Rcn><Nid>11300</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Dorsal Horn Interneurons in Sensory Processing</Name><PI>Hanns Ulrich Zeilhofer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Chronic pain syndromes are to a large extent due to maladaptive plastic changes in the CNS. A CNS area particularly relevant for such changes is the spinal dorsal horn, where inputs from nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers undergo their first synaptic integration. This area harbors a sophisticated network of interneurons, which function as a gate-control unit for incoming sensory signals. Several different types of interneurons can be distinguished based e.g. on their neurotransmitter and neuropeptide content. Despite more than 40 years of research, our knowledge about the integration of these neurons in dorsal horn circuits and their contribution to sensory processing is still very limited. This proposal aims at a comprehensive characterization of the dorsal horn neuronal network under normal conditions and in chronic pain states with a focus on inhibitory interneurons. A genome-wide analysis of the gene expression profile shall be made from defined dorsal horn interneurons genetically tagged with fluorescent markers and isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting. A functional characterization of the connectivity of these neurons in spinal cord slices and of their role in in vivo sensory processing shall be achieved with optogenetic tools (channelrhodopsin-2), which permit activation of these neurons with light. Finally, behavioral analyses shall be made in mice after diphteria toxin-mediated ablation of defined interneuron types. All three approaches shall be applied to na&#195;&#175;ve mice and to mice with inflammatory or neuropathic pain. The results from these studies will improve our understanding of the malfunctioning of sensory processing in chronic pain states and will provide the basis for novel approaches to the prevention or reversal of chronic pain states."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,467,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIATOMITE"><Rcn>103873</Rcn><Nid>10601</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>Genome-enabled dissection of marine diatom ecophysiology</Name><PI>Chris Bowler</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Diatoms are the most successful group of eukaryotic phytoplankton in the modern ocean. Recently completed whole genome sequences have revealed a wealth of information about the evolutionary origins and metabolic adaptations that may have led to their ecological success. A major finding is that they have acquired genes both from their endosymbiotic ancestors and by horizontal gene transfer from marine bacteria. This unique melting pot of genes encodes novel and largely unexplored capacities for metabolic management. The project will address the current gap in knowledge about the physiological functions of diatom gene products and about the evolutionary mechanisms that have led to diatom success in contemporary oceans. We will exploit genome-enabled approaches to pioneer new research topics addressing:
1. How has diatom evolution enabled interactions between chloroplasts and mitochondria that have provided diatoms with physiological and metabolic innovations?
2. What are the relative contributions of DNA sequence variation and epigenetic processes in diatom adaptive dynamics?
By combining these questions, we will uniquely be able to identify sentinel genes that have driven major physiological and metabolic innovations in diatoms, and will explore the mechanisms that have selected and molded them during diatom evolution. We will focus our studies largely on diatom responses to nutrients, in particular nitrate and iron, and will exploit the advantages of Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model diatom species for reverse genetics. The proposed studies will revisit textbook understanding of photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism, and will refine hypotheses about why diatoms dominate in contemporary ocean settings. By placing our studies in evolutionary and ecological contexts, in particular by examining the contribution of epigenetic processes in diatoms, our work will furthermore provide insights into how the environment selects for fitness in phytoplankton."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,423,320</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIDO"><Rcn>111574</Rcn><Nid>10061</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Perugia, Italy</HI><Name>Innovative drugs targeting IDO molecular dynamics in autoimmunity and neoplasia</Name><PI>Ursula Grohmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Catabolism of amino acids is an ancient survival strategy that also controls immune responses in mammals. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, is recognized as an authentic regulator of immunity in several physiopathologic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, in which it is often defective, and neoplasia, in which it promotes immune unresponsiveness. The PI&#226;&#128;&#153;s group recently revealed that IDO does not merely degrade tryptophan and produce immunoregulatory kynurenines but also acts as a signal-transducing molecule independently of its enzyme activity. IDO&#226;&#128;&#153;s signaling function relies on the presence of phosphorylable motifs in a region (small IDO domain) distant from the catalytic site (large IDO domain). Preliminary data indicate that IDO, depending on microenvironmental conditions, can move among distinct cellular compartments. Thus IDO may be considered a &#226;&#128;&#152;moonligthing&#226;&#128;&#153; protein, i.e., an ancestral metabolic molecule that, during evolution, has acquired the DYNAMIC feature of moving intracellularly and switching among distinct functions by changing its conformational state. By means of computational studies, Macchiarulo&#226;&#128;&#153;s group (team member) has identified distinct conformations of IDO, some of which are associated with optimal catalytic activity of the enzyme whereas others may favor tyrosine phosphorylation of IDO&#226;&#128;&#153;s small domain. A switch between distinct conformations can be induced by the use of ligands that bind either the catalytic site or an accessory pocket outside the IDO catalytic site. The first aim of DIDO is to decipher the relationships between IDO conformations and multiple functions of the enzyme. A second aim is to identify small molecules with drug-like properties capable of modulating distinct IDO&#226;&#128;&#153;s molecular conformations in order to either potentiate (a new therapeutic approach in autoimmune diseases) or inhibit (more efficient anti-tumor therapeutic strategy) immunoregulatory signaling ability of IDO."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,442,078</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DIVERSITY"><Rcn>99103</Rcn><Nid>9875</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Evolution of Pathogen and Host Diversity</Name><PI>Sunetra Gupta</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The study of host-pathogen systems is of central importance to the control of infectious disease, but also provides unique opportunities to observe evolution in action.  Many pathogen species have diversified under selection pressures from the host; conversely, genes that are important in host defence also exhibit high degrees of polymorphism.  This proposal divides into two parts: (1) the evolution of pathogen diversity under host immune selection, and (2) the evolution of host diversity under pathogen selection.  I have developed a body of theoretical work showing that discrete population structures can arise through immune selection rather than limitations on genetic exchange.  The predictions of this framework concerning the structure and dynamics of antigenic, metabolic and virulence genes will be empirically tested using three different systems: the bacterial pathogen, Neisseira meningitidis, the influenza virus, and the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The current theory will also be expanded and modified to address a number of outstanding questions such whether it can explain the occurrence of influenza pandemics.  With regard to host diversity, we will be attempting to validate and extend a novel framework incoporating epistatic interactions between malaria-protective genetic disorders of haemoglobin to understand their intriguing geographical distribution and their mode of action against the malarial disease.  We will also be exploring the potential of mechanisms that can organise pathogens into discrete strains to generate patterns among host genes responsible for pathogen recognition, such as the Major Histocompatibility Complex.

Despite dramatic progress in epigenetics during the past decade, DNA demethylation remains one of the last big frontiers and very little is known about it. DNA demethylation is a widespread phenomenon and occurs in plants as well as in animals, during development, in the adult, and during somatic cell reprogramming of pluripotency genes. The molecular identity of the DNA demethylase in animal cells remained unresolved and has hampered progress in the field for decades. In 2007 we published that Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 45 a (Gadd45a) is a key player in active DNA demethylation, which opened new avenues in the study of this elusive process. The goal of this project is to further analyze the mechanism of DNA demethylation as well as the role played by Gadd45 in development. Given the many unresolved questions in this burgeoning field, our work promises to be ground-breaking and therefore have a profound impact in unraveling one of the least understood processes of gene regulation. Specifically we will address the following points. I) The biological role of Gadd45 mediated DNA demethylation in mouse embryos and adults is unknown. We have obtained mouse mutants for Gadd45a,b, and g and we will analyze them for developmental defects and dissect the methylation regulation of relevant genes. II) The targeting mechanism by which Gadd45 is binding to and demethylating specific sites in the genome is a central unresolved issue. We have identified a candidate DNA binding protein interacting with Gadd45 and we will analyze its role in site specific targeting of DNA demethylation in vitro and in mouse. III) We found that Gadd45 is an RNA binding protein and we will therefore analyze how non-coding RNAs are involved in targeting and/or activating Gadd45 during DNA demethylation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,376,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DNAMET"><Rcn>104155</Rcn><Nid>13060</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>"DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation and cancer"</Name><PI>Kristian Helin</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA methylation patterns are frequently perturbed in human diseases such as imprinting disorders and cancer. In cancer increased aberrant DNA methylation is believed to work as a silencing mechanism for tumor suppressor genes such as INK4A, RB1 and MLH1. The high frequency of abnormal DNA methylation found in cancer might be due to the inactivation of a proofreading and/or fidelity system regulating the correct patterns of DNA methylation. Currently we have very limited knowledge about such mechanisms.

In this research proposal, we will focus on elucidating the biological function of a novel protein family, which catalyzes the conversion of 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-hmC). By catalyzing this reaction the TET proteins most likely work as DNA demethylases, and they might therefore have a role in regulating DNA methylation fidelity. Interestingly, accumulated data has in the last 2 years shown that TET2 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in various hematological cancers. We propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which TET2 regulates normal hematopoiesis, how its inactivation leads to hematopoietic malignancies and how the protein contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation patterns and transcription. Furthermore, we propose several experimental approaches for identifying proteins required for the recruitment of TET proteins to target genes and to analyze their role in the regulation of DNA methylation patterns and in cancer. Finally, we will investigate the potential functional role of 5-hmC and explore the potential mechanisms by which this modification could be erased.

We expect to provide new insights into the biology of DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation and contribute to unravel the roles of TET proteins in normal physiology and cancer."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,298,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DNAREPAIR"><Rcn>94429</Rcn><Nid>12660</Nid><HI>The Francis Crick Institute Limited, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Defects in DNA strand break repair and links to inheritable disease</Name><PI>Stephen West</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Our genetic material is continually subjected to damage, either from endogenous sources such as reactive oxygen species produced as by-products of oxidative metabolism, from the breakdown of replication forks during cell growth, or by agents in the environment such as ionising radiation or carcinogenic chemicals. To cope with DNA damage, cells employ elaborate and effective repair processes that specifically recognise a wide variety of lesions in DNA. These repair systems are essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Unfortunately, some individuals are genetically predisposed to crippling diseases or cancers that are the direct result of mutations in genes involved in the DNA damage response. For several years our work has been at the forefront of basic biological research in the area of DNA repair, and in particular we have made significant contributions to the understanding of inheritable diseases such as breast cancer, Fanconi anemia, and the neurodegenerative disease Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia-1 (AOA-1). The focus of this ERC proposal is: (i) to define the phenotypic interplay between three inheritable cancer predisposition syndromes, Fanconi anemia, Bloom s syndrome and breast cancers caused by mutation of BRCA2, (ii) to determine the biological role of the newly discovered GEN1 Holliday junction resolvase in homologous recombination and repair, and (iii) to understand the actions of Aprataxin and Senataxin in relation to the inheritable neurodegenerative diseases AOA-1 and AOA-2, respectively.

On the other hand, tens of thousands of now-living species are polyploid and contain multiple copies of their genome. The paucity of ancient genome duplications and the existence of so many species that are currently polyploid provide an interesting and fascinating enigma. A question that remains is whether these older genome duplications have survived by coincidence or because they did occur at very specific times, for instance during major ecological upheavals and periods of extinction. It has indeed been proposed that chromosome doubling conveys greater stress tolerance by fostering slower development, delayed reproduction and longer life span. Furthermore, polyploids have also been considered to have greater ability to colonize new or disturbed habitats.  If polyploidy allowed many plant lineages to survive and adapt during global changes, as suggested, we might wonder whether polyploidy will confer a similar advantage in the current period of global warming and general ecological pressure caused by the human race. Given predictions that species extinction is now occurring at as high rates as during previous mass extinctions, will the presumed extra adaptability of polyploid plants mean they will become the dominant species? In the current proposal, we hope to address these questions at different levels through 1) the analysis of whole plant genome sequence data and 2) the in silico modelling of artificial gene regulatory networks to mimic the genomic consequences of genome doubling and how this may affect network structure and dosage balance. Furthermore, we aim at using simulated robotic models running on artificial gene regulatory networks in complex environments to evaluate how both natural and artificial organism populations can potentially benefit from gene and genome duplications for adaptation, survival, and evolution in general."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,217,525</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DRYLIFE"><Rcn>89086</Rcn><Nid>11852</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Surviving the dry state: engineering a desiccation-tolerant mammalian cell</Name><PI>Alan Tunnacliffe</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Certain plants, animals and micro-organisms are able to dry out completely and yet remain viable, a phenomenon known as anhydrobiosis ( life without water ), or desiccation tolerance. This proposal addresses the molecular mechanisms responsible for desiccation tolerance and aims to confer these mechanisms on desiccation-sensitive mammalian cells, establishing a new field in biotechnology: a form of synthetic biology we have called anhydrobiotic engineering.  One feature of anhydrobiotic organisms is the production of many examples of highly hydrophilic proteins (or  hydrophilins ) in preparation for severe dehydration. Although data are limited, these hydrophilins are suggested to fulfil various roles in preserving homeostasis of the desiccating cell, including the maintenance of protein, nucleic acid and membrane structure. The proposed project will investigate the function of hydrophilins, engineer these and other elements as desiccation protection modules, and introduce modules into mammalian cell lines. By combining protection modules and using an iterative deployment strategy, we aim to achieve an engineered mammalian cell with high viability in the dried state.  Anhydrobiotic engineering will find applications in cell banking, e.g. of hybridoma collections, and cell-based technologies including tissue engineering.

Consequently, many of the known defense genes of plants against fungal pathogens are rapidly loosing effectiveness under agricultural conditions. However, there are examples for durable resistance. It is one of the main research questions in plant biology to determine the genetic basis of such naturally occurring resistance and to understand the underlying biochemical and molecular cause for durability. This durability is characterized by the apparent inability of the pathogen to adapt to the resistance mechanism. The molecular understanding of durable resistance will contribute to future attempts to develop such resistance by design. We want to use two approaches towards understanding and developing durable resistance: the first one is based on the naturally occurring durable resistance gene Lr34 against rust and mildew diseases in wheat. This gene was recently isolated in our group and it encodes a putative ABC type of transporter protein, providing a possible link between non-host and durable resistance. Its function in resistance will be studied by genetic and biochemical approaches in the crop plant wheat, as there is no Lr34-type of resistance characterized in any other plant. However, there is a close Lr34-homolog in rice and its function will be investigated in this diploid system. The second approach will be based on natural diversity found in a specific resistance gene, conferring strong, but not durable resistance. This diversity will be used for a designed improvement of durability by developing new proteins or protein combinations to which the pathogen can not adapt. We will use the 15 naturally occurring alleles of the Pm3 powdery mildew resistance genes to identify the structural basis of specific interactions. Based on this characterization, we will develop intragenic or gene combination pyramiding strategies to obtain more broad-spectrum and more durable resistance.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,100,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="DrosoSpiro"><Rcn>188498</Rcn><Nid>9910</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>The Drosophila-Spiroplasma interaction as a model to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying insect endosymbiosis</Name><PI>Bruno Lemaitre</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Virtually every species of insect harbors facultative bacterial endosymbionts that are transmitted from females to their offspring, often in the egg cytoplasm. These symbionts play crucial roles in the biology of their hosts. Many manipulate host reproduction in order to spread within host populations. Others increase the fitness of their hosts under certain conditions. For example, increasing tolerance to heat or protecting their hosts against natural enemies. Over the past decade, our understanding of insect endosymbionts has shifted from seeing them as fascinating oddities to being ubiquitous and central to the biology of their hosts, including many of high economic and medical importance. However, in spite of growing interest in endosymbionts, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying most endosymbiont-insect interactions. For instance, the basis of the main phenotypes caused by endosymbionts, including diverse reproductive manipulations or symbiont-protective immunity, remains largely enigmatic. The goal of the present application is to fill this gap by dissecting the interaction between Drosophila and its native endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii. This project will use a broad range of approaches ranging from molecular genetic to genomics to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying key features of the symbiosis, including vertical transmission, male killing, regulation of symbiont growth, and symbiont-mediated protection against parasitic wasps. We believe that the fundamental knowledge generated on the Drosophila-Spiroplasma interaction will serve as a paradigm for other endosymbiont-insect interactions that are less amenable to genetic studies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,963,926</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Drosophilasignaling"><Rcn>89775</Rcn><Nid>8805</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Signaling Pathways Controlling Patterning, Growth and Final Size of Drosophila Limbs</Name><PI>Konrad Basler</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Developmental biology seeks not only to learn more about the fundamental processes of growth and pattern per se, but to understand how they synergize to enable the morphogenesis of multicellular organisms. Our goal is to perform real-time analyses of these developmental processes in an intact developing organ. By applying a vital imaging approach, we can circumvent the normal limitations of inferring cellular dynamics from static images or molecular data, and obtain the real dynamic view of growth and patterning. The wing imaginal disc of Drosophila, which starts out as a simple epithelial structure and gives rise to a precisely structured adult limb, will serve as an ideal model system. This system has the combined advantages of relative simplicity and genetic tractability. We will create several innovations that expand the current toolkit and thus facilitate the detailed dissection of growth and patterning. A key early step will be to develop novel reporters to dynamically and faithfully monitor signaling cascades involved in growth and patterning, such as the Dpp and Hippo pathways. We will also implement quantification techniques that are currently being set up in collaboration with an experimental physicist, to deduce, and alter, the mechanical forces that develop in the cells of a growing tissue. The large amount of quantitative data that will be generated allow us derive computational models of the individual pathways and their interaction. The focus of the study will be to answer the following questions: 1) Is the Hippo pathway regulated spatially and temporally, and by what signaling pathways? 2) Do mechanical forces play a pivotal controlling role in organ morphogenesis? 3) What are the global effects on growth, when pathways controlling patterning, cell competition or compensatory proliferation are perturbed?

However, which hit should be taken to the next level of development? This decision is most crucial as it entails huge financial commitments of the subsequent drug optimization. In consequence drugs are only developed against diseases that promise short-term profit. Chemogenomic profiling allows to compile parameters characterizing binding of drug candidates that achieve optimal interference with protein function. Membrane proteins demand different properties than viral ones. Either high isoform selectivity, promiscuous family-wide binding or efficient resistance tolerance is desired. This calls for very different ligand binding characteristics, requiring either enthalpy-/entropy-driven binding, rigid shape complementarity or pronounced residual mobility at the binding site. Interaction kinetics determine on/off-rates and the time a drug spends with its target. Their correct adjustment is essential for drug efficacy. At present chemogenomic binding parameters are rarely available and their correlation with the required target properties is hardly understood. We want to compile a knowledge base from congeneric protein-ligand series to correlate structural, thermodynamic, interaction-kinetic and dynamic behaviour to predict the qualities a lead must meet to optimally address a target. Our studies involve crystal structure analyses, microcalorimetry, molecular dynamics simulations, site-directed mutagenesis and interaction kinetics.

This proposal addresses the mechanisms of dynamic self-renewal in the intestine of Drosophila. Our recent work has outlined a paradigm explaining intestinal homeostasis in Drosophila that could apply also to humans. A new lab is being established in Heidelberg where we wish to extend these studies. Our objectives are to understand: 1) How intestinal stem cell pool sizes are regulated; 2) How the cytokines and growth factors that mediate gut homeostasis are controlled; and 3) How these signals regulate the ISC cell cycle. Established genetic and cell biological methods will be applied, supported by molecular assays (microarrays, qPCR, ChIP/Seq) of gene control. New pathways of ISC control will be discovered via comprehensive genetic screens using transgenic RNAi and gene over-expression. In vitro culture of ISCs will be developed and used for live imaging and molecular analysis of the mechanisms controlling ISC proliferation and differentiation. These studies should elaborate a paradigm explaining intestinal homeostasis in flies that can guide studies in mammals, eventually contributing to the diagnosis and treatment for diseases in which gut homeostasis is disrupted, such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.

Climate change is strongly impacting seasonal timing which makes a better understanding of the potential for micro-evolution of timing in natural populations essential. As any phenotypic change ultimately involves changes in the physiological mechanism underlying timing, we need to unravel the genetics of these mechanisms. I will carry out a highly integrated eco-evo-devo project on the causes and consequences of genetic variation in timing of reproduction in great tits (Parus major), an ecological model species for that we recently developed state-of-the-art genomic tools. I will develop a powerful instrument to study this timing mechanism by creating selection lines of early and late reproducing birds using genome-wide, rather than phenotypic, selection. The phenotypic response of selection lines birds will be assessed both in controlled environment aviaries and in birds introduced to the wild. To unravel how selection has altered the birds&#226;&#128;&#153; physiology I will measure key components of the physiological mechanism at the central, peripheral and egg production levels. As a unique next step I will then introduce selection line birds into a wild population to assess the fitness of these extreme phenotypes. This will enable me, for the first time, to estimate the selection on timing without confounds, which I will compare with traditional estimates using observational data. Finally, I will integrate genetics, physiology and ecology to hindcast the rate of genetic change in our wild population and validate this rate using DNA sampled over a 20-year period. This innovative project integrates state of the art developments in ecology, genetics and physiology (eco-evo-devo) will set new standards for future studies in other wild species and will be of key importance for our predictions of evolutionary responses to a warming world.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,808</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EARLYLIFE"><Rcn>107243</Rcn><Nid>12965</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>LEARNING TO SURVIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD</Name><PI>Henri Weimerskirch</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This project has the ambitious goal of providing new groundbreaking information on a poorly known, yet critical stage of the life of any animal, the EARLYLIFE. The originality and novelty of EARLYLIFE is to combine two fields in ecology generally considered independently: foraging ecology and demography.With the data obtained for a range of marine predators with contrasted life histories I will be in a position to test several long lasting hypotheses in ecology, in particular on the causes of mortality of young animals, learning abilities, as well as on the significance of delayed maturity in long lived animals. Ultimately the project will allow a robust evaluation of the potential effects of global changes on young animals, and its consequences for population dynamics and conservation of marine air breathing predators.
I will carry out EARLYLIFE in three steps, with my CNRS research group that brings together top researchers with complementary specialties and skills in animal tracking, foraging ecology, demographic modeling. First, using newly developed state of the art developments in bio-telemetry, bio-logging and biochemical markers, I will study for the first time the foraging ecology (movement, habitat, energetic, diet) of 13 species of seabirds and seals during their first years of life at sea after independence. This will allow estimating critical parameters such as the timing and causes of death, the spatial variation in mortality, as well as the extent of improvement in foraging skills at early stages. Second I will model the ontogenic changes occurring during the early stage of life, and contrast them with the foraging abilities of mature animals using our tracking data base. Finally, using our unique long term demographic data base I will examine to what extent, and how, environmental variability affects juvenile mortality, and models the potential effects of climate change and human activities on population dynamics."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,484,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ECAP"><Rcn>110855</Rcn><Nid>10163</Nid><HI>Universite De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Genetic/epigenetic basis of ethnic differences in cancer predisposition</Name><PI>Gian-Paolo Dotto</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Integration of large scale genetic and epigenetic analysis needs to be coupled with well defined biological hypotheses that can be experimentally tested. This project is aimed at developing a novel integrated approach to understand genetic and epigenetic predisposition to cancer with skin as model system.
The Caucasian (West European) and Asian (East Asian) populations differ substantially in their predisposition to skin cancer, specifically Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. As in other organs, skin SCC results from changes in both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. We will be focusing on two key gene regulatory networks of cells of the two compartments (keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts), with a key role in skin SCC. The ""keratinocyte network"" has Notch/p53/p63 as key nodes, while the ""dermal fibroblast network"" had Notch and AP1 family members. We will pursue two main goals :
1) We will test the hypothesis that a linkage can be established between specific genetic and epigenetic marks in the Caucasian versus Asian populations and differences in expression and function of ""keratinocyte and/or dermal fibroblast network genes"".
2) We will test the hypothesis that keratinocytes and/or dermal fibroblasts of Caucasian versus Asian individuals differ in their tumor yielding capability, and that these differences in cancer forming capability are due to differences in either ""keratinocyte or dermal fibroblast network genes"".

This project is a completely new research avenue in our group, but we expect that it will offer refreshing long-term research and translational opportunities for the field.

Because so little is known on endothelial cell (EC) metabolism, we will (i) via a multi-disciplinary systems-biology approach of transcriptomics, proteomics, computational network modeling, metabolomics and flux-omics, draw an endothelio-metabolic map in angiogenesis. This will allow us to identify metabolic regulators of angiogenesis, which will be further validated and characterized in (ii) loss and gain-of-function studies in various angiogenesis models in vitro and (iii) in vivo in zebrafish (knockdown; zinc finger nuclease mediated knockout), providing prescreen data to select the most promising candidates.

Most recently, digestion of CSPGs in the limbic system and cortex has led to a very substantial enhancement of memory.
The effects of CSPGs on plasticity and memory are largely through their concentration into PNNs, because transgenics lacking the PNN component link protein in the CNS have very attenuated PNNs, and show continuing plasticity into adulthood, and enhanced memory in just the same way as chondroitinase-treated animals. The PNN is therefore a novel therapeutic target that has not been explored.
This application focuses particularly on enhancement of memory through manipulation of PNNs.
In Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease (AD) and ageing the main cognitive disability is loss of memory. The enhancement of memory following chondroitinase treatment or PNN knockout in object memory is many times greater than obtained using cholinesterase inhibitors (the only currently available treatment for memory enhancement). PNN manipulation is therefore a particularly promising avenue for developing treatments to overcome the main cognitive disability of AD and ageing.
The aims of the application are:
1. Test the extent of memory enhancement due to PNN manipulation in models of AD due to Abeta, tau mutations and in aged CNS.
2. Establish the molecular mechanism for PNN effects on memory, focusing on Semaphorin3 presentation by PNNs, and direct effects via the PTPsigma receptor.
3. Discover the sulphation modifications of the CSPG glycan chains that enable binding of Semaphorin3s, activation of the PTPsigma receptor.
4. Analyse molecules that bind to PNN glycans, to identify new potential effectors of PNN effects on memory and plasticity
5. Testing in memory and plasticity models of novel PNN-targeted approaches.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,450,543</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ECOEVODEVO"><Rcn>108751</Rcn><Nid>10328</Nid><HI>Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of community self-organization through ontogenetic asymmetry</Name><PI>Andre Marc De Roos</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Classical theory on community ecology models dynamics as interplay between top-down and bottom-up effects of population abundances only and considers population composition irrelevant. It ignores food-dependent ontogenetic development, in particular somatic growth, which characterizes most species and uniquely distinguishes organisms from fundamental units in physical or chemical multi-particle systems. Similarly, evolutionary theory has ignored the potential population feedback on food-dependent ontogenetic development. Classic theory has been shown to apply in case of ontogenetic symmetry in energetics, when dynamics of population abundance and composition are independent.  Ontogenetic symmetry stipulates that mass-specific rates of net biomass turnover are independent of individual body size. Ontogenetic symmetry only represents a limiting, structurally unstable case, separating two stable domains with ontogenetic asymmetry in energetics, when either juveniles or adults have higher mass-specific net-biomass production. In case of ontogenetic asymmetry the dynamics of population abundance and composition become intimately linked, ultimately resulting in the emergence of positive feedbacks between densities of predators and their main prey. This transforms consumer-resource interactions into indivisible units, whose behavior can no longer be predicted from its constituting parts (the species). Ontogenetic asymmetry in energetics is thus a potent driver of self-organization in ecological communities. This research project aims at unraveling the eco-evolutionary dynamics of ontogenetic asymmetry in energetics, focusing on (1) the likelihood that ontogenetic asymmetry in energetics evolves as mechanism of self-organization in ecological communities, (2) the conditions that may have promoted or inhibited this evolution and (3) the extent to which ontogenetic asymmetry in energetics has contributed to the diversity of life and the development of complex life cycles."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,779,634</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ECOLIGHT"><Rcn>98090</Rcn><Nid>11866</Nid><HI>The University Of Exeter, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Ecological effects of light pollution</Name><PI>Kevin John Gaston</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The last 100 years have seen the dramatic spread of an evolutionarily unprecedented environmental change. Across huge areas, the spatial patterns and temporal cycles of light and dark that have previously remained approximately constant have been disrupted by the introduction of artificial night-time lights. This raises major concerns, given that light and dark provide critical resources and environmental conditions for organisms and play key roles in their physiology, growth, behaviour and reproduction, including the entrainment of internal biological clocks to local time. Indeed, it has long been recognised that light pollution of the night is likely to have profound consequences for the structure and functioning of populations and communities. Nonetheless, empirical studies of these effects remain wanting. This project will bring about a step change in understanding of the ecological consequences of night-time light pollution, addressing the principal question: How does the experimental manipulation of artificial night-time light influence population abundance, species composition and community structure? This will be answered using linked experimental studies. The results will have wide ramifications for understanding of the influences of rapid environmental change on population and community structure and of measures by which these can best be ameliorated."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,600,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ECOTELO"><Rcn>98411</Rcn><Nid>12785</Nid><HI>University Of Glasgow, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"The ecological significance of telomere dynamics: environments, individuals and inheritance"</Name><PI>Patricia Monaghan</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The current pace of change is such that many organisms face ever more rapid and severe fluctuations in their physical and biotic environments. A major challenge for ecologists and evolutionary biologists is in understanding how this will influence individuals, populations and ecosystems, and over what time scale such effects will occur. There is now great interest in so called 'maternal effects', which can generate rapid phenotypic responses, with both positive and negative fitness consequences in an ecological timeframe. In this project, I propose to examine a hitherto unconsidered route whereby the state of the mother alters the DNA that her offspring inherit, with profound effects on offspring reproductive performance and potential lifespan. This route is the effect of maternal state on telomeres, the DNA sequences that cap chromosomes ends; changes in the length and loss rate of telomeres could affect the longevity and reproductive output of individuals, their offspring and even grand-offspring. We still know very little about what telomere loss measurable at the cellular level actually means for organismal level performance, how it is influenced by environmental factors and intergenerational maternal effects, and how telomere dynamics relate to Darwinian fitness parameters.  We lack experimental studies that track telomere loss within individuals subjected to varying environmental circumstances and relate this to organismal level outcomes for parents and offspring. I plan to address this gap in our understanding in a novel and innovative experimental programme that tests the idea that the effects of environmental stressors on senescence rates and lifespan are linked to accelerated telomere loss and that, through this route, can affect more than one generation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,113,818</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ELABORATE"><Rcn>98876</Rcn><Nid>8917</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Elucidation of the molecular and functional basis of disease phenotypes in the rat model</Name><PI>Timothy Aitman</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Recent genetic studies have identified hundreds of susceptibility genes for common human diseases but genetic effects are small and identifying underlying mechanisms remains challenging. Rodent models offer significant advantages for analysis of disease phenotypes. Advances in genome resources and gene targeting have increased the attractiveness of the rat model for genetic studies but progress has been hampered by absence of relevant rat genome sequences.
We recently sequenced the genome of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and will shortly have completed the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat sequence. The SHR genome contains over 750 genes that are completely or partly deleted, or have a frameshift in their open reading frame. These sequence variants, along with variants controlling dysregulated gene expression that we characterised previously, most likely include the major determinants of SHR cardiovascular and metabolic disease phenotypes.
We shall determine the functional consequences of these variants by creating and phenotyping transgenic and knockout rats on the SHR and WKY genetic backgrounds, using transposon-mediated transgenesis and zinc-finger nuclease-mediated gene deletion recently shown to be highly efficient in rats. Genes will be prioritised for study by statistical and informatic analyses using our extensive physiological, gene expression and linkage data in these rat strains, and by comparative analysis with data from human genome-wide association studies. Confirmed rat disease genes will be tested for conserved functions in humans.
These proposals provide a systematic route to elucidating the molecular and functional basis of disease phenotypes in SHR and WKY rats, and for translating these findings to advance understanding of common human diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,476,108</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ELEGANSFUSION"><Rcn>98859</Rcn><Nid>8746</Nid><HI>Technion - Israel Institute Of Technology., Israel</HI><Name>Mechanisms of cell fusion in eukaryotes</Name><PI>Benjamin Podbilewicz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Membrane fusion is a universal process essential inside cells (endoplasmic) and between cells in fertilization and organ formation (exoplasmic). With the exception of SNARE-mediated endoplasmic fusion the proteins that mediate cellular fusion (fusogens) are unknown. Despite many years of research, little is known about the mechanism of cell-cell fusion. Our studies of developmental cell fusion in the nematode C. elegans have led to the discovery of the first family of eukaryotic fusogens (FF). These fusogens, EFF-1 and AFF-1, are type I membrane glycoproteins that are essential for cell fusion and can fuse cells when ectopically expressed on the membranes of C. elegans and heterologous cells.

Our main goals are:
(1) To determine the physicochemical mechanism of cell membrane fusion mediated by FF proteins.
(2) To find the missing fusogens that act in cell fusion events across all kingdoms of life.

We hypothesize that FF proteins fuse membranes by a mechanism analogous to viral or endoplasmic fusogens and that unidentified fusogens fuse cells following the same principles as FF proteins.

Our specific aims are:
AIM 1 Determine the mechanism of FF-mediated cell fusion: A paradigm for cell membrane fusion
AIM 2 Find the sperm-egg fusion proteins (fusogens) in C. elegans
AIM 3 Identify the myoblast fusogens in mammals
AIM 4 Test fusogens using functional cell fusion assays in heterologous systems

Identifying critical domains required for FF fusion, intermediates in membrane remodeling, and atomic structures of FF proteins will advance the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of eukaryotic cell fusion.

The process has two components: adaptation to ecological niches and production of new species. My aim is to make breakthroughs in understanding ecological speciation by the study of geographically parallel adaptive radiations in mycalesine butterflies that have yielded some 250 extant species in the Old World tropics. More empirical studies are needed because few radiations have been examined from many different perspectives (including in insects). It is not fully understood either how exactly radiation occurs or how exactly selection leads to speciation. This proposal provides a unique opportunity, outside a few vertebrate clades, to resolve this by fully integrating several lines of evidence and methodologies. My approach will be to study patterns of diversity and disparity in morphospace for several sets of key traits: 1) wing patterns, 2) larval host plant choice especially with respect to C3 and C4 photosynthesis, and 3) male secondary sexual traits and sex pheromones. We will collect phenotypic, genetic, developmental, and ecological data. Application of phylogenetic comparative methods to the relationships of all traits among all species will make inferences about the biological mechanisms that have driven diversification and speciation. The combination of surveys of morphospace, the use of comparative methods, and microevolutionary studies using laboratory models will provide a unique comprehensive view.

However, these technologies address only two aspects of the process, namely the stability of the receptors during purification and the ability to form well-diffracting crystals. The strategies also apply only to GPCRs and not transporters or ion channels. The recent successes have been of GPCRs that are expressed in either yeasts or in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, but many membrane proteins are expressed poorly in these systems or may be expressed in a misfolded non-functional form. A second issue with the future structure determination of GPCRs is the lack of generic technologies to allow the crystallisation of arrestin-GPCR and G protein-GPCR complexes. Although one G protein GPCR complex has been crystallised this was exceedingly diffciult and resulted in poor resolution of the GPCR component of the complex. We believe that it is possible to thermostabilise both arrestin and heterotrimeric G proteins, which will allow a simplified strategy for the crystallisation and structure determination of GPCR complexes. This is based on the development of the strategy of conformational thermostabilisation of GPCRs developed in our lab that has resulted in the structure determination of 3 different GPCRs bound to either antagonists, partial agonists, full agonists and/or biased agonists.

The aims are:
1. The development of generic methodology for the production of eukaryotic membrane proteins in mammalian cells.

A prominent molecular pathway converging on and downstream of the Pitx2 transcription factor confers left-handed information in the left side of the embryo, with players expressed on the right ensuring that the left determinants are excluded. Therefore, conferring or excluding left identity in left and right hand sides, respectively, drives L/R asymmetry. Some indications suggest that a program actively specifying right&#226;&#128;&#147;handed information could exist on the right. Our recent findings support this view. In a screening for novel regulators of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), we have identified a transcription factor, EMT2, which similarly to well known factor Snail, it is an EMT inducer. The EMT is crucial for the development of tissues during embryonic development and for the progression of carcinomas to the invasive state. Strikingly, again as Snail, in addition to promote EMT, the EMT2 factor is predominantly expressed on the right side and may operate instructing L/R identity on the right-hand side of the embryo.

With this background, our knowledge of the EMT and a series of genome-wide high-throughput approaches and a comprehensive functional analysis using the chick, the fish and the mouse as model systems we propose to reveal the putative molecular pathways conveying right-handed information and to reveal commonalities between L/R pathways and the EMT. In the long run, we aim at better understanding human pathologies that involve these morphogenetic and cellular processes, including pathological situs conditions (i.e. altered organ positioning) and cancer progression."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,460,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ENCODE"><Rcn>101565</Rcn><Nid>10458</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Environmental Control of Development</Name><PI>Henrietta Leyser Day</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Plant development is highly plastic, with major variations in form determined by the environment. An excellent example is shoot branching, where the body plan of the shoot system conferred by one genotype can range from a single unbranched stem, to a highly ramified bush, depending on the growth conditions. In recent years we have investigated the hormonal network that allows environmentally sensitive changes in shoot branching in Arabidopsis. Through the analysis of a set of monogenic mutants with clear effects on both the number of shoot branches produced and on its responsiveness to environmental inputs, we have developed a model for shoot branching control involving interactions between three systemically transported plant hormones. In collaboration with Prusinkiewicz (Calgary), we have built a computational implementation of this model, which captures the phenotypes of wild-type plants and, through the manipulation of single biologically plausible model parameters, our mutant phenotypes. While there is still much to learn about individual network components, the mechanistic framework we have established is sufficiently well developed to allow network-level investigation. We therefore propose an ambitious project to use natural allelic variation in shoot branching and its environmental sensitivity as in vivo differently parameterized versions of the shoot branching regulatory network, which can be compared with parameter space exploration in our computational model. By investigating the properties of shoot branching in diverse genotypes and in the computational model parameter space, we will identify trait correlations that will contribute to understanding the architecture of the regulatory network. This approach will simultaneously test the validity of our current model and provide new hypotheses for investigation. Furthermore, the rapidly moving genomics tools available in Arabidopsis will allow us to elucidate the genetic basis for key network properties.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,483,870</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ENSEMBLE"><Rcn>100654</Rcn><Nid>10992</Nid><HI>Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet Ntnu, Norway</HI><Name>Neural mechanisms for memory retrieval</Name><PI>May-Britt Moser</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Memory is one of the most extraordinary phenomena in biology.

One of the greatest challenges has been the dynamic nature of memory. Whereas memories can be retrieved over time periods as short as milliseconds, underlying coding principles are normally inferred from activity time-averaged across many minutes.

We will combine genetics, molecular biology and biochemical approaches with computational modelling to allow us to translate the extensive  nuts and bolts  information into an understanding of how  the engine  works. A particular strength of modelling will be its predictive nature and ability to distinguish between key components and those with subsidiary or redundant roles. The system we will use is vernalization, the cold-induced Polycomb-silencing of the target locus, FLC. We will dissect the many phases of vernalization: the triggering of FLC repression by prolonged cold; the nucleation and epigenetic stability of chromatin changes at FLC; and the spreading of the silencing yet spatial restriction to FLC. Our goal will be a full understanding of the complexity involved in the epigenetic silencing of this locus, described in a quantitative model that reveals how the silencing is induced by temperature and how individual components of the silencing network are integrated into a robust whole.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) - the single leading cause of death in Europe - is jointly determined by genetic and lifestyle factors. It is unknown, however, how diet, nutrients, and lifestyle factors modulate genetic susceptibility. For scientific and public health reasons, there is a strategic need to study such interactions reliably. There is a unique opportunity for a cost-effective and powerful study because we have:
-conducted detailed assessment of diet and other lifestyle factors in 520K participants in a pan-European prospective study
-identified &gt;12K incident CHD cases accrued during &gt;5M person-years at risk
-identified a random sub-cohort of &gt;15K participants without CHD to serve as referents
-commenced assay of lipid and other markers in 12K cases and 15K referents
-prepared DNA for genetic assay.
In 12K CHD cases and 15K referents, we will assay: &gt;217K genetic variants contained in the state-of-the-art metabochip; 37 fatty acids; and vitamin D metabolites. Analyses will focus on: discovery of interactions; causal evaluation of biomarkers; CHD risk scores.
The findings should open new horizons and contribute towards: 1) explaining missing heritability 2) shaping nutritional guidelines 3) personalising preventive medicine 4) defining approaches to modify genetic susceptibility by avoiding deleterious lifestyles 5) identifying biomarkers that are priority therapeutic targets and 6) innovative prognostic tools.
Gene-lifestyle interplay is a major future growth area.

Even more recently, it has been recognized that microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that are thought to regulate gene expression by sequence-specific base pairing in mRNA targets, also play a key role in the biology of the cell, and that they can also have an impact in the development of many diseases, including cancer (le Sage and Agami, 2006; Blenkiron and Miska, 2007). However, there is little understanding about epigenetic modifications that might regulate the activity of microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long interspersed ncRNAs (lincRNAs), promoter-associated RNAs (PASRs and PALRs) and terminator-associated sRNAs (TASRs) (Calin et al., 2007; Mercer, et al., 2009; Ghildiyal &amp; Zamore, 2009; Jacquier, 2009). Our ignorance in this respect is even more significant if we consider these questions in the domain of cancer. Making best use of our expertise in several of these fields, my group will tackle the study of the epigenetic modifications that regulate ncRNA expression and how the DNA methylation and histone modifications profiles of these loci might become distorted in human cancer.  These findings could have profound consequences not only in the understading of tumor biology, but in the design of better molecular staging, diagnosis and treatments of human malignancies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,240</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EPISUSCEPTIBILITY"><Rcn>90229</Rcn><Nid>13096</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Epigenome and Cancer Susceptibility</Name><PI>P&#195;&#164;ivi Tuulikki Peltom&#195;&#164;ki</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Early detection is crucial for the outcome of most cancers. Prevention of cancer development is even more desirable. To facilitate these ultimate goals we aim to construct a comprehensive view of the stepwise process through which common human cancers, such as colorectal cancer, arise. In particular, we aim to identify novel mechanisms of cancer susceptibility by focusing on the epigenome, whose alterations may underlie several phenomena related to chronic adult-onset disease that are not explained by genetics alone. The stepwise process of carcinogenesis can be accelerated or halted for various reasons, including inherited susceptibility and diet. The human multi-organ cancer syndromes hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as well as their murine counterparts, the Mlh1+/- mouse and the ApcMin/+ mouse, will be used as shortcuts to study the interplay between the epigenome and genome in tumorigenesis and to identify biomarkers of cancer susceptibility, malignant transformation, and tumor progression. This will be achieved by molecular profiling of normal and tumor tissues, cell line studies, in vitro functional assays, and in silico approaches. Additionally, the role that the epigenome plays to mediate the effects of the Western type diet on colorectal tumorigenesis will be examined in the mouse. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic alterations are potentially reversible, which makes them promising targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EPLORE"><Rcn>104182</Rcn><Nid>12636</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>EPidemiological Left ventriclar Outcomes Research in Europe</Name><PI>Jan Albert Hendrik Staessen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Heart failure (HF) affects 15 million Europeans and entails higher mortality and health care costs than cancer. EPLORE addresses this issue by prospective epidemiological research in 4 European countries and by a proof-of-concept clinical trial. WP1 will for the first time at the population level document the incidence and progression of subclinical LV dysfunction and clarify whether asymptomatic LV dysfunction, as picked up by the newest echocardiographic techniques, predicts cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, including HF. WP2 will investigate the contribution of ventricular-arterial coupling disease and mechanical LV dyssynchrony to subclinical LV dysfunction. WP3 will identify a set of urinary polypeptides that signify early LV dysfunction and validate these biomarkers by showing that they predict deterioration of LV function, progression to HF and the incidence of CV complications over and beyond established risk factors. WP3 will also search for novel panels of circulating biomarkers, of which combined measurement will add information (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) to established biomarkers (e.g., NT-proBNP) and identify genetic variants involved in the progression of LV dysfunction, either causally or as biomarker. WP4 consists of a randomised clinical trial to translate in a high-risk high-gain setting the results of WPs 1-3 into clinical practice and to identify a new treatment modality that potentially slows progression of diastolic LV dysfunction.  Dissemination in WP5 will contribute to new guidelines for the prevention and treatment of HF. WP6 includes governance, monitoring research strategies and output, and protection of IPR. In conclusion, EPLORE will advance risk stratification and the early diagnosis of subclinical HF. The project will potentially result into specific treatments for diastolic LV dysfunction and inform guidelines for prevention and treatment of HF. It will benefit 20% of Europeans who currently have subclinical LV dysfunction.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,391,440</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ERA"><Rcn>99209</Rcn><Nid>12121</Nid><HI>Max Planck Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Wissenschaften E.v., Germany</HI><Name>Experimental Research into Ageing</Name><PI>Linda Partridge</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The diseases of older age are a major challenge to human societies. Despite the complexity of ageing, both reduced food intake (dietary restriction) and simple genetic alterations can greatly increase lifespan and provide broad-spectrum protection against diseases of ageing in laboratory animals. Furthermore, there is strong evolutionary conservation of mechanisms. For instance the nutrient-sensing insulin/IGF and TOR signalling network modulates lifespan in yeast, invertebrates and rodents. There is thus a major scientific opportunity to use model organisms to discover how to ameliorate ageing and hence to protect against ageing-related disease in humans. Our recent findings on dietary amino acid balance in the fruit fly Drosophila imply that consumption of nutrients irrelevant to metabolism is life-shortening. Using a novel genomic approach, we shall determine if the same is true in mice and measure the role of dietary imbalance in extension of lifespan by dietary restriction. Late life dietary restriction in invertebrates can increase future survival as much as permanent restriction, implying that chemical mimetics administered late in life could also be fully effective. We shall determine if dietary restriction in mice has similarly acute effects, and use dietary switches to identify candidate mechanisms of increased health and lifespan.  Recent evidence has pointed to particular components of nutrient-sensing pathways as promising drug targets for prevention of age-related disease, and we shall investigate two candidates. The work will break new ground in understanding how ageing is modulated by diet and signaling pathways and point to interventions that could protect against the effects of ageing to reduce the burden of ageing-related disease in humans."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,489,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ERC-ID"><Rcn>111050</Rcn><Nid>10143</Nid><HI>Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Excision Repair and chromatin interaction dynamics</Name><PI>Willem Vermeulen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"DNA damage is a fact of life. Lesions hamper genome function, induce mutations causing cancer and trigger senescence or cell death contributing to aging. Therefore cells are equipped with a sophisticated defence machinery: DNA Damage Response (DDR) including different repair pathways. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is versatile repair process, eliminating helix-distorting lesions, e.g. bulky adducts and sun-induced lesions. Very cytotoxic transcription-blocking lesions are removed by a dedicated sub-pathway, transcription-coupled (TC-)NER. The impact of NER is highlighted by 4 disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), trichothiodystrophy and UV-sensitive syndrome (UVSS). XP patients are cancer-prone due to global-genome (GG-)NER defects, whereas CS patients, impaired in TC-NER, display progeroid features, which are thought to derive from endogenous oxidative DNA lesions hampering transcription. Consistent with this, CS cells are sensitive to oxidative agents, whereas TC-NER-deficient UVSS patients are not sensitive to oxidative agents and do not display aging features. This implies lesion-specific TC-NER, arguing for distinct operational TC-repair machineries. The relative importance of DDR pathways varies with the type of damage, cell type and stage of development determining onset of cancer and aging pathologies. The challenging ambition of this proposal is to gain in depth insight into the role of NER in protection against cancer and aging by an integral multi-disciplinary approach which includes new mouse models for novel TC-NER genes, live cell and tissue NER kinetic analyses, advanced proteomics and analysis of NER-related chromatin dynamics to dissect cross-talk with other pathways. The strength of this project is the comprehensive strategy, availability of unique tools (e.g. collection of bona fide NER mutant mice), operational top notch technical platforms for all proposed approaches and proven competence and expertise."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EUKARYOTIC RIBOSOME"><Rcn>94945</Rcn><Nid>12484</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Structural studies of the eukaryotic ribosome by X-ray crystallography</Name><PI>Nenad Ban</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The ribosome is a large cellular organelle that plays a central role in the process of protein synthesis in all organisms. Currently, structural information at atomic resolution exists only for bacterial ribosomes and some of their functional complexes. Eukaryotic ribosomes are larger and significantly more complex than their bacterial counterparts. They consist of two unequal subunits with a combined molecular weight of approximately 4 million Daltons and contain 70-80 different protein molecules and four different RNAs. Currently the only structural information on eukaryotic ribosomes is available from cryo electron microscopic reconstructions in the nanometer resolution range, which is insufficient to derive information about the function of the eukaryotic ribosome at the atomic level. The aim of this proposal is to use X-ray crystallography to obtain structural and functional information on the eukaryotic ribosome and its functional complexes at high resolution. The key targets of the structural work will be: i) the structure of the small ribosomal subunit, ii) the structure of the large ribosomal subunit, and iii) structures of complexes involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. Besides the obvious fundamental importance of this research for understanding protein synthesis in eukaryotes the proposed studies will also be the prerequisite for understanding the structural basis of the regulation of protein synthesis in normal cells and how it is perturbed in various diseases.

This is accomplished by initiating DNA replication from many replication origins distributed along chromosomes. Ensuring that each origin is efficiently activated once and only once per cell cycle is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the genome. Recent evidence indicates that defects in the regulation of origin firing may be important contributors to genome instability in cancer. Strict once per cell cycle DNA replication is achieved by a two-step mechanism. DNA replication origins are first licensed by loading an inactive DNA helicase (Mcm2-7) into pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs). This can only occur during G1 phase. Initiation then occurs during S phase, triggered by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), which promote recruitment of proteins required for helicase activation and replisome assembly. Research proposed herein will lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanism and regulation of DNA replication. We have reconstituted the licensing reaction with purified proteins which will be used to characterise the mechanism of licensing and the mechanism by which licensing is regulated in the cell cycle. We will also use this system to reconstitute events leading to the initiation of DNA replication. We will use genetic and biochemical approaches to characterise the mechanisms by which perturbed licensing causes gross chromosome rearrangements. We will also explore mechanisms involved in regulating the temporal programme of origin firing and how origin firing is regulated in response to DNA damage. Work in budding yeast and mammalian cells will be pursued in parallel to exploit the specific advantages of each system.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,449,999</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EUKORIGINMIT"><Rcn>98151</Rcn><Nid>9323</Nid><HI>University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Eukaryotic genomic origins, parasites, and the essential nature of mitochondria"</Name><PI>Thomas Martin Embley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Understanding the origin and evolution of eukaryotes, their genomes and organelles, are among the most important and exciting challenges facing biology.

It is also necessary to look beyond the narrow focus of a few model organisms, and to thoughtfully embrace a wider selection of eukaryotic diversity. Over the past few years, my lab has studied the genomes and mitochondrial homologues (mitosomes and hydrogenosomes) of parasitic protozoa that represent significant health hazards in both the developed and developing world.  These microbial eukaryotes will provide the model systems for investigations which aim to deliver major progress in understanding the importance of lateral gene transfer for eukaryotic genome origins and flux, for understanding how parasites exploit their host cells, and for identifying the essential functions of organelles related to mitochondria, which now appear to be vital components of all eukaryotic cells."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,703</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EURECA"><Rcn>185418</Rcn><Nid>12359</Nid><HI>Aarhus Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Eukaryotic Regulated RNA Catabolism</Name><PI>Torben Heick Jensen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Regulation and fidelity of gene expression is fundamental to the differentiation and maintenance of all living organisms. While historically attention has been focused on the process of transcriptional activation, we predict that RNA turnover pathways are equally important for gene expression regulation. This has been implied for selected protein-coding RNAs (mRNAs) but is virtually unexplored for non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).

The intention of the EURECA proposal is to establish cutting-edge research to characterize mammalian nuclear RNA turnover; its factor utility, substrate specificity and regulatory capacity. We foresee that RNA turnover is at the core of gene expression regulation - forming intricate connection to RNA productive systems &#226;&#128;&#147; thus, being centrally placed to determine RNA fate. EURECA seeks to dramatically improve our understanding of cellular decision processes impacting RNA levels and to establish models for how regulated RNA turnover helps control key biological processes.

The realization that the number of ncRNA producing genes was previously grossly underestimated foretells that ncRNA regulation will impact on most aspects of cell biology. Consistently, aberrant ncRNA levels correlate with human disease phenotypes and RNA turnover complexes are linked to disease biology. Still, solid models for how ncRNA turnover regulate biological processes in higher eukaryotes are not available. Moreover, which ncRNAs retain function and which are merely transcriptional by-products remain a major challenge to sort out. The circumstances and kinetics of ncRNA turnover are therefore important to delineate as these will ultimately relate to the likelihood of molecular function. A fundamental challenge here is to also discern which protein complements of non-coding ribonucleoprotein particles (ncRNPs) are (in)compatible with function. Balancing single transcript/factor analysis with high-throughput methodology, EURECA will address these questions."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,960</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EVO500"><Rcn>94947</Rcn><Nid>12775</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Origin of a cell differentiation mechanism and its evolution over 500 million years of life on land</Name><PI>Liam Dolan</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The evolution of the first rooting systems approximately 470 million years ago was a critical event in the history of life on Earth because it allowed the growth of complex multicellular eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms &#226;&#128;&#147; plants - on the surface of the land.

first land plants (liverworts) comprised a mass of unicellular tip-growing filaments (rhizoids) that grew from the plant surface into the soil. All root systems that evolved since then similarly comprise a system of tipgrowing filamentous cells located at the interface between the plant and the soil, indicating that the differentiation of filamentous root cells has been critical for root function for the past 470 million years. This proposal aims to characterize the origin and evolution of this essential cellular differentiation process. The proposed research is in three parts:
First we propose to define the mechanism that controlled the development of the first land plant root system by identifying genes that control liverwort rooting system (rhizoids) development and
characterizing their regulatory interactions.

They are generally considered as intra-chromosomal parasites. However, their periodical activity bursts influenced organization of host genomes and contributed to beneficial traits. Remarkably, number of transposon generated phenotypic innovations was subsequently selected by humans during plant domestication and breeding. Therefore, retrotransposons could be also considered as attractive endogenous source of genetic variation. Unfortunately so far there is no experimental/technological means to exploit this potential in a controlled fashion.

Recently my laboratory revealed surprisingly selective epigenetic, environmental and developmental mechanisms controlling retrotransposition in Arabidopsis. Here, I intend to build on this knowledge and establish well controlled retrotransposition system a crop plant to liberate its innate genetic diversity buried in silenced TEs.

To achieve this, I propose a stepwise strategy with the following three objectives:

1. Deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and environmental cues controlling retrotransposition in Arabidopsis thaliana and use this model plant to develop universal methodology for detection of retrotransposition.
2. Transfer the knowledge and methodologies to non model plant. I propose to use Arabidopsis lyrata as close relative of A. thaliana, however with 50% enlarged genome due to expansion of retrotransposon populations.
3. Using methodologies and experimental conditions developed for A. thaliana and A. lyrata we will apply them to maize where we can also take advantage of genetic resources (mutants in epigenetic regulation) in conjunction with responses to selected abiotic stresses.

However, we contend that some features of Darwinian evolution have been neglected when cancer is studied, as have some aspects of evolution that are special to cancers.

These factors may render invalid the classical model in which successive mutations with large advantages arise and  spread through the tumour in selective sweeps. To incorporate these neglected features and to test how tumorigenesis depends on factors such as mutation rate, selection and size constraints, we shall set up a comprehensive model of tumour growth incorporating cell birth, death, division and mutation parameters. We shall examine specific aspects of cancer-as-evolution in mice. By marking mutant clones using fluorescent proteins, we can track them and see how they persist, spread and die. We shall also determine the mutation profiles and genetic diversity of mutant clones and whole tumours in mice and humans using next-generation sequencing.

The vision is to enable evolution of aptamers that per se possess most of the desired properties, thereby alleviating the need for extensive post-SELEX procedures. This will be realized by combining the unique properties of LNA with innovative methods for LNA aptamer evolution. LNA aptamer technology is envisioned to enable evolution of aptamers displaying maximum chemical diversity, minimum size and high biostability. The developed strategies will be applicable not only towards evolution of therapeutic aptamers, which will be the main subject of this program, but also towards evolution of aptamers for biosensing, diagnostic and imaging applications. The program is at the very frontier of biotechnology research and spans the areas of chemistry, molecular biology and drug research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,720</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EVOMECH"><Rcn>94468</Rcn><Nid>13037</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The evolution of mechanisms that control behaviour</Name><PI>Alasdair Iain Houston</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The approach to animal behaviour adopted by behavioural ecology is based on the investigation of the adaptive function of behaviour. A common assumption is that the action of natural selection on behaviour can be predicted without reference to processes inside the organism. I believe that it is time to combine an analysis based on evolution with one based on mechanisms, where a mechanism might be psychological, physiological or a combination of both. Animals have mechanisms that need to perform well in changing and dangerous environments. In order to understand the evolution of mechanisms, we need a fundamental change in the sort of models that are analysed. Instead of building complex models of optimal behaviour in simple environments, we need to evolve simple mechanisms that perform well in complex environments. This approach can provide a novel and unified perspective on a range of issues involving decisions by animals, including humans. The main objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive view of behaviour that can account for both adaptive and non-adaptive actions. This involves developing a novel theoretical framework based on an understanding of the underlying information-processing rules, combined with an evolutionary perspective that explains how any such rule came into existence in the first place. The theme of coping with uncertain and dangerous environments is used to investigate various features of behaviour such as rationality and self-control. These topics lead to the broader issues of the organisation of thought and emotions. The project also explores the consequences of the evolved behaviour and the implications for conservation and animal welfare.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,749,277</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EVOMOBIL"><Rcn>111249</Rcn><Nid>9014</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Co-evolution of viruses, plasmids and cells in Archaea: pattern and process</Name><PI>Patrick Louis Forterre</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Interactions between cells and mobile elements such as viruses and plasmids (the mobilome) have played a major role in life evolution. However, up to now, evolutionary studies have mainly focused on cellular genomes (building species trees). My project is to reconstruct the history of interaction between cells, plasmids and viruses (PVs) at the domain level to answer questions such as: to which extent PVs co-evolved with their hosts? How was cellular history influenced by PVs? What is the main directionality of gene fluxes between PVs and cells? The project will focus on Archaea, the third domains of life, because we only have a robust species phylogeny for this domain. We will perform an exhaustive description of PV families in all available archaeal genomes, as well as free PVs, using a combination of in silico methods and expert analyses. Phylogenetic and network analyses will be used to reconstruct the history of PVs with the objective to quantify horizontal versus vertical evolution and to sort out the web and tree-like components of archaeal history. Preliminary analyses have revealed the importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in archaeal evolution. However, the processes behind these HGT remain mysterious, especially for hyperthermophiles. In parallel to our in silico analyses, we will explore the possible role of membrane vesicles (MV) in HGT. We have shown that archaeal MVs can transfer DNA and that some of them harbour plasmid or viral genomes. We want tackle questions such as: can these MVs transfer DNA between different species, different orders or even different domains? We will also study MV formation and fusion in comparison to those involved in viral infection to better understand possible evolutionary and physiological connections between MV and PV. Production of MV is a universal process and their role in life evolution could have been largely underestimated up to now.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXPLORE"><Rcn>101500</Rcn><Nid>10748</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Exploring novel pathways governing immunity and leukemia by studying the genetic basis of human myeloid cell defects- from genetics to gene therapy</Name><PI>Christoph Klein</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Genomic system biology approaches offer new aspects to understand the basis of diseases and to develop new therapeutic strategies. Here, we propose to study rare human variants of the immune system to provide novel explanations of mechanisms governing inflammation and leukemogenesis. Following a full circle of translational research, our group has previously defined several novel clinical entities and elucidated their molecular defects (Nat Med 2007, NEJM 2009). Further studies have highlighted the critical role of new pathways for general biological principles (Immunity 2005, Nat Gen 2007, Nat Med 2008). Finally, we have developed innovative gene and cell-based therapeutic strategies and tested their feasibility in clinical trials (JCO 2007, NEJM2009).

The overall goal of &#194;&#191;Explore&#194;&#191; is to decipher novel pathways controlling myeloid cell function and leukemogenesis. The following specific aims are proposed:
1. To elucidate genetic defects causing neutrophil disorders in children by homozygosity mapping and to perform functional studies in vitro and in vivo using relevant animal models
2. To identify novel genes controlling endoplasmic reticulum cell function and the secretory pathway in myeloid cells by employing RNA-interference technology
3. To define the role of novel factors involved in controlling the topology of the endoplasmic reticulum and ER-stress in murine model systems
4. To study the role of HAX1 in hematopoisis and leukemogenesis using a new murine HAX1flox allele and to develop a clinical gene therapy approach for patients with severe congenital neutropenia due to HAX1-deficiency

These studies will not only identify novel genetic factors controlling human immunity and leukemogenesis, but may ultimately impact on the development of novel therapeutic strategies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,648</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EXTREMOPHILE MAMMAL"><Rcn>103201</Rcn><Nid>10625</Nid><HI>Max Delbrueck Centrum Fuer Molekulare Medizin, Germany</HI><Name>Molecular exploitation of an extremophile mammal</Name><PI>Gary Richard Lewin</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The African naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is an unusual rodent species that has evolved physiological strategies to adapt to an extreme ecological niche. It is the only poikilothermic mammal (cold-blooded), has an extraordinarily long life span for its small size (in excess of 30 years) and lives in large colonies organized like those of termites (eusocial). We have shown that naked mole-rats lack physiological attributes thought essential and protective for most other animal species. For example, severe tissue acidosis is life threatening as well as painful and yet naked mole-rats completely lack behavioral sensitivity to acid and sensory neurons are not activated by protons in this species. Here we will identify functionally important naked mole-rat gene variants that may account for aspects of the extreme physiology in this species. We have already identified candidate naked mole-rat-genes whose altered function, compared to other mammals, may account for acid insensitivity, lack of pain sensitization and poikilothermy in this species. These gene variants will be functionally characterized by replacing the mouse gene with a naked-mole rat variant using molecular genetic techniques. In addition we will use next generation sequencing to identify further naked mole-rat gene variants.

The possibility of nitrate-dependent or metal-dependent anaerobic oxidation of CH4 (AOM) was generally dismissed. However, about 6 years ago the microbes responsible for the nitrate-AOM reaction were discovered. This was followed by molecular approaches that resulted in the identification of the responsible Methylomirabilis oxyfera bacteria. Recently, the widespread environmental occurrence of these bacteria was demonstrated leading to the realization that AOM may play a significant role in the CH4 and nitrogen cycles. M. oxyfera is a unique microbe with unusual properties that we only begin to understand: the production of oxygen from NO by a putative NO dismutase and a very unusual polygonal cell shape. Even less is known about metals (Fe3+ or Mn4+) as electron acceptors for AOM. The aim of this project is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the metabolism and ecological importance of the M. oxyfera bacteria, and to enrich new metal-dependent AOM microbes. Such understanding contributes directly to our environment and economy because AOM is a new sustainable opportunity for nitrogen removal from wastewater. The results will show how the CH4, nitrogen and iron cycles are connected and may lead to new ways of mitigating methane emission. The biodiversity and contribution of AOM-microbes to the biogeochemical cycles in oxygen-limited ecosystems will be investigated, and new metal-AOM enrichments will be performed. Together the environmental and metabolic data will help to understand how and to what extent AOM-microbes contribute to the biogeochemical cycles and thus shape atmosphere of our planet. The research lines will employ state-of-the- art methods to unravel the exceptional properties of these highly unusual and important microbes. The experiments will be performed in one of the world best equipped laboratories for microbial ecology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EpInflam"><Rcn>108270</Rcn><Nid>9493</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zu Koeln, Germany</HI><Name>Epithelial cells in inflammation</Name><PI>Manolis Pasparakis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The cross talk between the host and the microbiota is believed to be the major determinant of health and disease in the gastrointestinal tract. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestine with unclear aetiology. Deregulation of the cross talk between the intestinal microbiota and the host immune system is considered a main factor contributing to IBD. Genomic studies revealed associations of NOD2 and of genes regulating autophagy and ER stress with an increased risk for IBD. Mutations in these pathways compromise Paneth cell dependent epithelial antibacterial defences causing alterations in the intestinal microbiota, termed dysbiosis. However, mutations in NOD2 or autophagy genes are not sufficient to cause intestinal inflammation in humans or in mice, suggesting that dysbiosis by itself cannot cause inflammation but additional, as yet unidentified, factors are required to precipitate the pathogenesis of IBD in genetically susceptible individuals. Mouse model studies revealed that epithelial specific mutations sensitizing intestinal epithelial cells to apoptosis or necroptosis triggered spontaneous intestinal pathologies with many features of human IBD, including loss of Paneth cells, impaired epithelial antimicrobial defences and chronic intestinal inflammation. We hypothesize that pathways controlling programmed cell death critically contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD by acting on Paneth cells to regulate epithelial antibacterial defences and simultaneously regulating intestinal epithelial cell survival and the integrity of the epithelial barrier. The aims of this research proposal are: a) to dissect the pathways regulating Paneth cell death and the development of dysbiosis in the gut, and b) to elucidate the additional genetic or environmental factors regulating intestinal epithelial barrier integrity that are likely to synergise with Paneth cell dysfunction and dysbiosis to trigger chronic intestinal inflammation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EpiTwin"><Rcn>94848</Rcn><Nid>9151</Nid><HI>King's College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The role of epigenetic factors in the aetiology of common complex diseases using twins</Name><PI>Timothy David Spector</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Twin studies traditionally have been used to assess the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors. Nearly all common diseases and traits have now been found to be heritable and GWA studies are discovering many novel genes. However 95% of the heritability is not yet identified and discordances within identical (MZ) twin pairs cannot be explained by known environmental factors. The missing heritability could be due to epigenetic factors- which are ideally studied with twins. The proposed study uses MZ twins discordant for 10 important age-related complex disease traits to uncover epigenetic signals that are associated with disease. We will study in detail epigenetic differences using a high throughput Illumina methylation array in the 5% most discordant pairs for the following disease susceptibility traits : obesity (BMI), type II diabetes (insulin resistance) , hypertension (BP), hyperlipidemia (lipid levels), Osteoporosis (BMD), biological aging (white cell telomere levels), Allergy (IgE) , asthma (FEV1), platelet volume (MPV) and smoking. We will use the TwinsUK cohort of 3000 phenotyped MZ twins for a discovery group. For replication of the most significant associations we will use singletons from the 200 extreme highs and lows of the remaining 4000 phenotyped twins as a &#226;&#128;&#152;case&#226;&#128;&#153;-&#226;&#128;&#152;control &#226;&#128;&#152;association study genotyped by the same array.

Causality will be explored using bioinformatics, cell specificity experiments and longitudinal studies using DNA stored for up to 15 years- as well as parental and offspring DNA. Epigenomics is a major future growth area. This large scale study would enable us to maintain a European lead and act also a valuable future epidemiologic resource and enable important collaborations with other European researchers and cohorts.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,658</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EpigenetiX"><Rcn>94348</Rcn><Nid>11253</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Epigenetic regulation and monoallelic gene expression: the X-inactivation paradigm and beyond</Name><PI>Edith Heard</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) represents a classic example of epigenetics in mammals. In this process, one of the two X chromosomes in females is converted from an active into a clonally heritable, inactive, state during early embryonic development, to ensure dosage compensation between the sexes. This process is also remarkable in that an entire chromosome is silenced while its homologue, present in the same nucleus, remains active. Thus, in addition to being an epigenetics paradigm, XCI also represents a powerful model for monoallelic gene expression and could provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying other examples of random, monoallelic regulation. The key locus underlying the initiation of XCI is the X-inactivation centre (Xic). The Xic ensures the induction and monoallelic expression of a non-coding RNA (Xist) that is responsible for triggering chromosomal silencing in cis during development. We would like to understand the mechanisms underlying the Xic's functions and define whether other, Xic-like loci exist in the genome. Once XCI is established, the inactive state is initially reversible but becomes progressively locked in as development proceeds due to numerous epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as nuclear compartmentalization and asynchronous replication. In the proposed program, we will exploit our expertise in XCI to develop new lines of research and use novel technologies to investigate monoallelic gene expression, nuclear organization and epigenetics during development. Our main objectives are (1) to understand how monoallelic expression states are established and maintained during early development and (2) to assess how chromosome dynamics and nuclear architecture can impact on these states.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,860,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EvoEPIGEN"><Rcn>111340</Rcn><Nid>10102</Nid><HI>Universitat Konstanz, Germany</HI><Name>Evolved Replication Systems for Epigenetics</Name><PI>Andreas Marx</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Cells have a broad functional and morphological diversity due to differential gene expression. Research in epigenetics combines the study of inheritable, phenotypical changes in the gene expression pattern of a specific cell type that are not caused by a transformed nucleotide sequence of the genetic code itself. Epigenetic marks are represented by a variety of molecular mechanisms including DNA methylation. Alterations of DNA methylation play a crucial role in the onset of diseases like cancer. Many DNA methylation-based biomarkers have been evaluated and the analysis of epigenetic alterations is a promising tool for disease diagnostics, prognostics, and prediction of drug response. In future, this will allow to adapt therapies to a person, which will increase the chance for successful treatments, minimizing side-effects of chemotherapy and administration of ineffective drugs and thus, prevent the onset of follow-up problems that are associated with these events. Thus, cost-effective but robust means that allow the analysis of DNA methylation-based biomarkers are of urgent need. Several methods for analysis of these biomarkers are employed. However, those that have the required resolution are laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone and thus, prevent broad applications of DNA methylation profiling in clinical diagnostics. The aim of this project is to overcome the barriers that prohibit using DNA methylation profiling in broad clinical applications for diagnostics, prognostics, and prediction of drug response. The objectives will be reached by a multidisciplinary systemic approach harnessing the power of organic synthesis (i.e. new synthetic modified nucleotides), biochemical and structural enzyme studies, and directed evolution of DNA polymerases tailored for new replication systems for epigenetics. The evolved replication systems will be superior to known techniques by superseding the bottle necks of current approaches paving the way for broad applications.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,483,966</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EvoThyme"><Rcn>107366</Rcn><Nid>12829</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Thymopoiesis: From Evolutionary Origins to Future Therapies</Name><PI>Thomas Boehm</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The role of the thymus in cell-mediated immunity was discovered about 50 years ago and it has since become apparent that the thymus is the site of T cell development in all extant vertebrates. Although it has been recognized that thymopoiesis can only be fully understood by the analysis of both the thymic epithelial microenvironment and the intrathymic haematopoietic compartment, significant gaps in our knowledge of thymopoiesis remain.
The proposal addresses major biological questions of thymopoiesis in a novel way. It is based on an evolutionarily informed approach that makes iterative use of distinct animal models (fish and mouse), and additionally considers information obtained from the analysis of human patients with thymopoietic deficiencies. The proposal aims to develop an animal model conducive to transplantation of xenogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cells. This system will be used for subsequent analysis of haematopoietic and immunological properties of genetically intractable fish species. The proposal also aims to determine the structure of genetic networks underlying the development and function of thymic epithelial cells and intrathymic T cell differentiation. This information will be used to explore the possibility of alleviating the phenotypic consequences of disease genes by interfering with the function of genes situated elsewhere in the respective genetic networks rather than by restoring faulty gene function. Evolutionarily constrained inventories of such genetic networks will be additionally used for the design of synthetic thymopoietic environments in non-cognate tissues, either using combinations of thymopoietic factors or by exploiting the thymopoietic capacity of Foxn1, a master regulator of thymic epithelial cell differentiation. Overall, the proposal aims at the development of evolutionarily informed genetic and cell-based strategies to reverse failing thymus function.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="EvolvingNodules"><Rcn>110667</Rcn><Nid>11461</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Molecular inventions underlying the evolution of the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis</Name><PI>Martin Parniske</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Crop production worldwide is sustained through nitrogen fertilizer produced via the energy-demanding Haber-Bosch process. One group of closely related plants evolved to become independent of nitrogen from the soil by engaging in symbiosis with bacteria that convert atmospheric nitrogen to plant-usable ammonium and are hosted within specialized organs, the root nodules. Nodulation evolved several times independently but exclusively in four related orders, the Fabales, Fagales, Cucurbitales and Rosales (FaFaCuRo) based on a putative genetic predisposition to evolve root nodules acquired by a common ancestor of this clade.
This project aims to identify the elusive genetic switches involved in the evolution of nodulation. It builds on the underlying idea that a succession of events co-opted preexisting developmental programs to be activated by symbiotic stimuli. We will systematically investigate and compare the prewired connections between signaling pathways and developmental modules present in non-nodulating and nodulating relatives, to identify components acquired by nodulators. The Rosaceae represent a particularly attractive family to test evolutionary hypotheses by transferring candidate switches from a nodulator into the genome of closely related sister genera to enable nitrogen fixing root nodule symbiosis. Most genera of the Rosaceae including economically valuable targets such as apple and strawberry are non-nodulating.  A minority of Rosaceae form ancestral, lateral root related actinorhiza nodules with Frankia actinobacteria, which differs from the derived, more complex symbiosis of legumes with rhizobia. Frankia strains have a very broad host range and can fix nitrogen at ambient oxygen concentrations thus imposing minimal constraints on a host environment suitable for efficient symbiosis. Thus, by retracing small evolutionary steps within the Rosaceae we will take a huge leap towards nitrogen-fertilizer independent crops for sustainable agriculture.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,114</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FAST"><Rcn>102522</Rcn><Nid>8858</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Roma Torvergata, Italy</HI><Name>Investigating new therapeutic approaches to Friedreich's Ataxia</Name><PI>Roberto Testi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Friedreich&#226;&#128;&#153;s Ataxia (FRDA) is a devastating degenerative disease with no specific therapy. It is passed by autosomal recessive inheritance and affects 1:30,000 individuals in Caucasian populations. Symptoms appear in the first decade of life and include progressive and unremitting lack of movement coordination, leading to complete inability, and dilated cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure, the most common cause of premature death. FRDA is due to the insufficient transcription of the gene coding for the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Reduced cellular levels of frataxin cause impaired mitochondrial function and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, leading to accelerated cell death in critical tissues.
Severity of the disease critically depends on residual frataxin levels. Therapeutic efforts are mostly focused on increasing cellular frataxin . We found that frataxin is normally degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We identified the lysine responsible for the ubiquitination of frataxin and, by computational screening followed by experimental validation, we identified and validated a series of small molecules, called ubiquitin-competing molecules (UCM), that prevent frataxin ubiquitination and induce frataxin accumulation in cells derived from FRDA patients. Moreover, treatment with UCM partially rescues aconitase and ATP production defects in cells derived from FRDA patients.
Our goal is two fold: 1) submit a set of leads we already identified, as well as their new and more complex derivatives, to preclinical testing in FRDA mice  2) identify the E3 ligase that is responsible for frataxin ubiquitination, and investigate the possibility to use it as a druggable target for small molecules to prevent frataxin degradation."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,496,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FICModFun"><Rcn>111594</Rcn><Nid>10059</Nid><HI>Universitat Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>FIC-Mediated Post-Translational Modifications at the Pathogen-Host Interface: Elucidating Structure, Function and Role in Infection</Name><PI>Christoph Georg Fritz Dehio</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The ubiquitous FIC domain catalyzes post-translational modifications (PTMs) of target proteins; i.e.
adenylylation (=AMPylation) and, more rarely, uridylylation and phosphocholination. Fic proteins are
thought to play critical roles in intrinsic signaling processes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes; however, a
subset encoded by bacterial pathogens is translocated via dedicated secretion systems into the cytoplasm of
mammalian host cells. Some of these host-targeted Fic proteins modify small GTPases leading to collapse of
the actin cytoskeleton and other drastic cellular changes. Recently, we described a large set of functionally
diverse homologues in pathogens of the genus Bartonella that are required for their &#226;&#128;&#156;stealth attack&#226;&#128;&#157; strategy
and persistent course of infection [1, 2]. Our preliminary functional analysis of some of these host-targeted
Fic proteins of Bartonella demonstrated adenylylation activity towards novel host targets (e.g. tubulin and
vimentin). Moreover, in addition to the canonical adenylylation activity they may also display a competing
kinase activity resulting from altered ATP binding to the FIC active site. Finally, we described a conserved
mechanism of FIC active site auto- inhibition that is relieved by a single amino acid exchange [1], thus
facilitating functional analysis of any Fic protein of interest. Despite this recent progress only a few Fic
proteins have been functionally characterized to date; our understanding of the functional plasticity of the
FIC domain in mediating diverse target PTMs and their specific roles in infection thus remains limited.
In this project, we aim to study the vast repertoire of host-targeted Fic proteins of Bartonella to: 1)
identify novel target proteins and types of PTMs; 2) study their physiological consequences and molecular
mechanisms of action; and 3) analyze structure-function relationships critical for FIC-mediated PTMs and infer from these data determinants of target specificity, type of PTM and mode of regulation. At the forefront of infection biology research, this project is ground-breaking as (i) we will identify a
plethora of novel host target PTMs that are critical for a &#226;&#128;&#156;stealth attack&#226;&#128;&#157; infection strategy and thus will open
new avenues for investigating fundamental mechanisms of persistent infection; and (ii), we will unveil the
molecular basis of the remarkable functional versatility of the structurally conserved FIC domain.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,699,858</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FLUPLAN"><Rcn>94581</Rcn><Nid>12281</Nid><HI>Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Novel strategies to combat future influenza pandemics</Name><PI>Albertus Dominicus Marcellinus Erasmus Osterhaus</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The Mexican influenza A virus (H1N1) reminds us that the threat of an influenza pandemic is real. The 1918 Spanish flu virus, also started as a low pathogenic virus that mutated into a highly pathogenic virus within months, causing more than 50 million deaths. The Mexican influenza A virus (H1N1) may follow the same path. FLUPLAN will expand our knowledge of the packaging signals that govern reassortment events between influenza A viruses in general and between the Mexican influenza A virus (H1N1) and circulating human, porcine and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses in particular. FLUPLAN will thus lead to fundamental insights in the mechanisms that govern reassortment phenomena, providing a risk assessment concerning the pandemic potential of circulating avian and mammalian influenza A viruses. This will provide us with a panel of possible reassortant viruses of potentially pandemic nature. The MVA vaccine vector system that efficiently induced broad protective immunity against HPAI-H5N1 viruses in macaques, will be used for the preparation of a repository of MVA-H based pandemic vaccine seed viruses.The selection will be based on the reassortant viruses mentioned above, and on a repository of avian influenza viruses of the 16HA subtypes including the Mexican influenza A virus (H1N1) of avian/swine origin. The added value of including a relevant MVA-NP in the immunization schedule to obtain broader and longer protection will be determined in a macaque infection model.

We propose to improve the plant saccharification characteristics by mimicking a strategy successfully used by phytopathogenic microorganisms. These produce pectic enzymes before other cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to weaken the linkages between the wall components and favour the maceration of the plant tissue. Homogalacturonan (HGA), a major component of pectin, is synthesized in a methylated form and is de-esterified in the wall by methylesterases (PMEs). De-esterified HGA interacts with calcium to form ""egg-box"" structures, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of the entire wall. We propose to improve saccharification by expression in plants of microbial polygalacturonases (PGs) hydrolizing HGA. Plants expressing a fungal PG have reduced levels of HGA and enhanced saccharification (unpublished preliminary data). Since PG activity in pianta affects normal growth, a technology of enzyme control through the use of specific protein inhibitors will be developed. A second strategy to be adopted for weakening the ""egg-box"" is the overexpression of PME inhibitors. This may cause not only an increased degradability but also an enhanced biomass production. FUEL-PATH will provide detailed information on the structure, function and construction of tailor-made enzymes and inhibitors suitable for the saccharification process. FUEL-PATH will also address the relationship between pectin composition and developmental responses mediated by hormones in PG-expressing plants. A genetic screen will be performed to isolate genes involved growth defects and increased cell wall degradability and these will be characterized for a possible biotechnological use."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,099,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS"><Rcn>94579</Rcn><Nid>12702</Nid><HI>Stichting Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut-Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis, Netherlands</HI><Name>DISSECTING GENETIC DEPENDENCIES IN CANCER</Name><PI>Ren&#195;&#169; Bernards</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>While significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, several major issues remain unresolved. First, only a minority of patients respond to most forms of (chemo)therapy. It is generally believed that this poor responsiveness to drugs has its origin, at least in part, in the molecular heterogeneity of cancer. This heterogeneity requires the use of biomarkers to stratify patients having seemingly similar tumors according to their likely responses to specific cancer therapies. To identify such biomarkers, we will use large-scale genetic screens to identify genes that are causally involved in controlling responses to cancer drugs. Such genes are likely biomarkers of drug responsiveness in the clinic. Availability of such drug response biomarkers will facilitate a more personalized therapy choice for each individual patient. A second major deficit in effective cancer therapy is the lack of sufficient highly selective drug targets. The large-scale cancer genome re-sequencing efforts already indicate that there is a paucity of druggable genes that are consistently mutated in cancer and the same holds true for genes that are consistently over-expressed in cancer. Hence, there is an urgent need for innovative drug targets that have a similar cancer-selectivity as the genes that are specifically mutated or over-expressed in cancer. In this project, we will use large-scale loss of function genetic screens, exploiting the concept of synthetic lethality , to identify genes whose inactivation is selectively toxic to cells having a defined cancer-specific genetic alteration. Drugs against these targets will be highly cancer-selective, as their activity hinges on the presence of a specific genetic defect, which is only present in the cancer cell.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,176,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FUSIMAGINE"><Rcn>188489</Rcn><Nid>12186</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>A new neuroimaging modality: from bench to bedside</Name><PI>Micka&#195;&#171;l Tanter</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"NeuroImaging systems are invaluable tools in the understanding of the brain both for fundamental research and clinical diagnosis. However, recent improvements in deep brain imaging technology have been somewhat limited because most of them are based on incremental innovation of mature techniques (EEG, PET and fMRI) instead of breakthrough.
In FUSIMAGINE, a genuinely new functional brain imaging modality will be developed and validated whose performances could have a major impact in neuroscience from fundamental research to clinical applications.
This new modality is based on the use of ultrafast ultrasound scanners able to reach more than 10 000 frames per second (fps) compared to the usual 50 fps in conventional ultrasound scanners. This concept relies on compounded plane wave transmissions introduced by my team and demonstrates up to 100-fold increase in the sensitivity of blood flow measurements. It enables to image the subtle hemodynamic changes in small brain vessels and thus brain activity thanks to neurovascular coupling. Functional Ultrasound (fUS by analogy to fMRI) is a real breakthrough in brain imaging as our project will demonstrate that:
in neuroscience, fUS provides a unique real time, portable and deep brain functional imaging technique for awake and even freely moving small animal imaging, moreover with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution (~100&#194;&#181;m, 50ms).
in clinical diagnosis, fUS provides a unique bedside neuro-imaging system of newborns brain activity through the fontanel window. Such real time system will permit to monitor and better understand neonatal seizures and hemorrhages. On adults, fUS provides a unique functional imaging modality during neurosurgery to predict the cortical mapping remodeling resulting of tumor development (such as low-grade gliomas). Finally, new adaptive skull bone correction techniques implemented on the system will enable us to perform non invasive transcranial fUS imaging on human adults through the temple bone."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,603</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FUTURE-PHARMA"><Rcn>99830</Rcn><Nid>9523</Nid><HI>St George's Hospital Medical School, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Exploiting plants for the production of future generation recombinant pharmaceuticals</Name><PI>Julian K-C.

Thus products such as monoclonal antibodies are very expensive and often beyond the reach of the world&#226;&#128;&#153;s poor. The problem is compounded by the fact that important strategies for preventing diseases such as HIV and rabies typically involve large doses of multiple antibodies and other virucidal proteins. Plants have emerged as alternative production platforms for biopharmaceutical proteins because they are less expensive, more scalable and potentially could be transferred to developing countries. Recently, the first products have reached the clinic, but many of them are follow-on products already manufactured in mammalian cells.
Here, Prof Julian Ma (St George&#226;&#128;&#153;s Hospital Medical School, London, UK) and Prof Dr Rainer Fischer (RWTH Aachen University, Germany) aim to develop innovative ways to use plants for the economical, safe and sustainable production of combinations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) based on recombinant proteins, thereby pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in plants beyond current capabilities with fermenter-based systems.
We will focus on the production of antibodies and lectins against HIV and rabies, with the aim of generating GMP-compliant microbicidal cocktails for evaluation in human trials. Key aspects of the project will include the production of APIs both individually and as combinations in plants, the development of technologies allowing the introduction of transgenes into pre-determined genomic loci, the use of click chemistry to optimize the production and stoichiometry of recombinant protein cocktails, the development of candidate products for both topical and parenteral administration and the development of downstream processing concepts that are transferrable to developing countries, such as minimal processing and processing trains based on pre-assembled disposable modules.

Crop production has to double by 2050 to keep pace with global population growth increasing to 9 billion. This target is challenging given the impact of climate change on water availability and the drive to reduce fertilizer inputs to make agriculture more environmentally sustainable. In both cases, developing crops with improved water and nutrient uptake efficiency would provide the solution. Root architecture critically influences nutrient and water uptake efficiency. Rooting depth impacts the efficient acquisition of soil nitrogen (and water) since nitrate leaches deep into the soil. Phosphate use efficiency could be significantly improved without increasing root depth by manipulating the angle of root growth to explore the top soil where this macronutrient accumulates. The genes that regulate root traits such as angle, depth and density in crops remain to be identified. A key impediment to genetic analysis of root architecture in crops grown in soil has been the ability to image live roots non-invasively. Recent advances in microscale X-ray Computed Tomography (&#239;&#129;&#173;CT) now permit root phenotyping. Major technical and scientific challenges remain before &#239;&#129;&#173;CT can become a high throughput phenotyping approach. This ambitious multidisciplinary research programme will be achieved through six integrated work packages. The first 3 work packages will create high-throughput &#239;&#129;&#173;CT (WP1) and image analysis (WP2) tools that will be used to probe variation in root systems architecture within wheat germplasm collections (WP3). Work packages 4-6 will identify root architectures that improve water (WP4) and nitrate uptake efficiencies (WP5) and pinpoint the genes that regulate these traits. In parallel, innovative mathematical models simulating the impact of root architecture and soil properties will be developed as tools to assess the impact of architectural changes on uptake of other nutrients in order to optimise crop performance (WP6)."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,498,588</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FliesCan"><Rcn>102724</Rcn><Nid>10351</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut De Recerca Biomedica (Irb Barcelona), Spain</HI><Name>Modelling Cancer Traits in Drosophila</Name><PI>Cayetano Gonzalez Hernandez</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Despite significant advance, cancer treatment remains suboptimal. Anatomical and physiological differences between humans and simple model organisms like Drosophila are many and major, and preclude the modelling of key aspects of the disease as it proceeds in vertebrates. However, malignant tumors in vertebrates and flies are made of cells that have derailed from their normal course of development, grow out of control, become immortal, invasive, and kill the host. Moreover, like most solid human tumors, Drosophila malignant tumors display chromosomal instability and copy number variation. In addition, some of them are characterized by the upregulation of germline genes, a distinct feature of certain human cancers. Drosophila tumor models offer an unprecedented opportunity to study these basic malignant traits, which characterize human tumors, in a genetically tractable organism, applying sophisticated genome-wide and comprehensive functional assays at a rate and with a level of detail that are not possible in vertebrates. The goal of this project is twofold: (1) to identify new paths of intervention to inhibit tumor growth, and (2) to determine the origin and function of aneuploidy and changes in gene copy number in malignant growth. We are expectant that the results obtained during the course of this project might eventually have a real impact in human health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,406,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FlyingPolycomb"><Rcn>91846</Rcn><Nid>11742</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Polycomb in development, genome regulation and cancer</Name><PI>Giacomo Cavalli</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) genes were discovered in Drosophila melanogaster as repressors and activators of Hox genes, a set of transcription factors that specify the antero-posterior axis of the body plan. PcG and trxG proteins form multimeric complexes that are required to maintain their expression state after the initial transcriptional regulators disappear from the embryo. Subsequent work led to a better understanding of their mechanisms of action. Moreover, PcG and trxG genes have also been identified in vertebrates, where they regulate Hox genes, they are involved in cell proliferation, stem cell identity and cancer, genomic imprinting in plants and mammals and X inactivation. PcG and trxG components form multimeric complexes. Some trxG and PcG components possess methyltransferase activities directed toward specific lysines of histone H3, whereas other trxG and PcG proteins interpret these histone marks. Recent studies have described the genomewide distribution of PcG proteins and of their related histone modification in Drosophila and other species. However, the PcG recruitment code to their target chromatin is still not understood, and the mechanism of PcG-mediated gene silencing is unclear. The formation of subnuclear silencing compartments might contribute to the stable repression of transcription. Drosophila PcG proteins have a speckled nuclear distribution and the number of these so-called PcG bodies is progressively reduced during development. We showed that multiple PREs can associate in the nucleus to enhance the strength of PcG-mediated silencing. However, we do not know how frequent is this clustering process and how important it is functionally at a genomewide level.

In particular, many plant and metazoan miRNAs play crucial roles in embryonic/post-embryonic development; the precise timing and localization of their expression is thus crucial to their action. Hence, specific miRNA repertoires underlie specific cell identities, and deviations from such repertoires often have deleterious consequences such as cancer. Many miRNAs also help organisms to adapt to stress, thus, given their importance in virtually all aspects of biology, understanding how, when and where miRNAs exert their actions is of paramount importance. To date, however, the few approaches to miRNA-mediated silencing in whole organisms have not taken into account the exquisite definition, in space and time, of their biogenesis and action, leading to an inaccurate view of the biology of these molecules at the systems level.
Using the root system of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we propose to explore, at single-cell and subcellular resolution levels, the biology of the main miRNA effector protein, ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) in intact tissues. Using a combination of state-of the-art technologies for single-cell forward genetics, protein purification and RNA/polysome profiling, we will establish a functional spatiotemporal map of the root AGO1-sRNAome and identify cell-specific modifiers of sRNA biogenesis and action. As a complement to the above approaches, chemical genetics will isolate small molecules allowing direct and specific manipulation of AGO1-dependent sRNA pathways in planta. RNA silencing modifier compounds will also accelerate forward and reverse approaches of RNA silencing in plants with sensitized genetic backgrounds, and uncover novel connections between miRNA/siRNA and physiological or metabolic pathways.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,251,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Fru circuit"><Rcn>90539</Rcn><Nid>12879</Nid><HI>Forschungsinstitut Fuer Molekulare Pathologie Ges.m.b.h, Austria</HI><Name>Neural basis of Drosophila mating behaviours</Name><PI>Barry Dickson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>How does information processing in neural circuits generate behaviour? Answering this question requires identifying each of the distinct neuronal types that contributes to a behaviour, defining their anatomy and connectivity, and establishing causal relationships between their activity, the activity of other neurons in the circuit, and the behaviour. Here, I propose such an analysis of the neural circuits that guide Drosophila mating behaviours.  The distinct mating behaviours of males and females are genetically pre-programmed, yet can also be modified by experience. The set of ~2000 neurons that express the fru gene have been intimately linked to both male and female mating behaviours. This set of neurons includes specific sensory, central, and motor neurons, at least some of which are directly connected. Male-specific fruM isoforms configure this circuit developmentally for male rather than female behaviour. In females, mating triggers a biochemical cascade that reconfigures the circuit for post-mating rather than virgin female behaviour.  We estimate that there are ~100 distinct classes of fru neuron. Using genetic and optical tools, we aim to identify each distinct class of fru neuron and to define its anatomy and connectivity. By silencing or activating specific neurons, or changing their genetic sex, we will assess their contributions to male and female behaviours, and how these perturbations impinge on activity patterns in other fru neurons. We also aim to define how a specific experience can modify the physiological properties of these circuits, and how these changes in turn modulate mating behaviour. These studies will define the operating principles of these neural circuits, contributing to a  molecules-to-systems  explanation of Drosophila s mating behaviours.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,492,164</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FunMeta"><Rcn>102723</Rcn><Nid>12521</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Perugia, Italy</HI><Name>Metabolomics of fungal diseases: a systems biology approach for biomarkers discovery and therapy</Name><PI>Luigina Romani</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Humans have evolved intimate symbiotic relationships with a consortium of gut microbes (including fungi) and individual variations in the microbiome influence host health and disease. The fact that fungi are capable of colonizing almost every niche within the human body suggests that they must possess particular immune adaptation mechanisms, the breakdown of which may result in fatal fungal infections and severe fungal diseases. Traditional reductionist approaches of the past have not been sufficient to address these new challenges in the pathogenesis of fungal diseases. Here, I propose an integrated, systems biology approach to understand the role of L-tryptophan (trp) metabolic pathways in multilevel host&#226;&#136;&#146;fungus interactions. Present in mammals as well as in fungi, pathways of trp metabolic pathways are exploited by the host and the fungal biota for survival and immune adaptation. A variety of indole derivatives, generated through conversion from dietary trp by symbiotic bacteria, activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/IL-22 pathway that provides antifungal resistance and tissue repair. Harmful inflammatory responses to fungi are instead tamed by kynurenines generated via the enzyme indoleamine 2,3&#226;&#128;&#147;dioxygenase (IDO) of the trp pathway. Through high-throughput wet-lab &#226;&#128;&#152;omics&#226;&#128;&#153; techniques combined with computational techniques, the project aims at defining the molecular basis of mammalian and fungal IDO activity and a metabolic network linking the metabolic phenotype (metabotype) to immune adaptations and its possible breakdown in experimental and human fungal infections.

This is an ambitious, highly innovative project aimed at developing an in vivo selection procedure, based on gene transfer of two genetic libraries cloned into Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-based vectors, for the identification of novel secreted factors or microRNAs providing benefit against various degenerative diseases. Two arrayed libraries will be generated, one coding for ~1,300 cDNAs from the mouse secretome, the other for all known microRNAs (~800 genes). Pools of vectors from each library will be obtained with serotypes suitable for in vivo transduction of different organs. The vectors will be injected in a series of mouse models of degenerative disorders involving damage to cardiomyocytes,, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration and loss of beta-cells in the pancreas. The degenerative conditions will drive the selection for secreted factors or miRNA putatively preventing cell apoptosis, enhancing residual cell function or, in the best possible scenario, promoting tissue regeneration. This in vivo selection approach, which is supported by very encouraging preliminary results, has never been attempted before and is rendered possible by the property of AAV vectors to be produced at high titers, infect tissues at high multiplicity, persist in the transduced cells for prolonged period of times and efficiently express their transgenes in vivo. In addition to its final goal of identifying novel biotherapeutics, the project entails the successful achievement of several intermediate objectives and is expected to extend both technology and knowledge beyond the state-of-the art.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,824,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FunctionalEdge"><Rcn>94113</Rcn><Nid>12076</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Determining the roles of the nuclear periphery in mammalian genome function</Name><PI>Wendy Bickmore</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>DNA sequence and epigenetic chromatin maps are important in understanding how genomes are regulated. However, these maps are linear and do not account for the three-dimensional context within which the genome functions in the cell. The spatial organisation of the genome in the nucleus is not random and is conserved in evolution, implying that it is under functional selection. This proposal aims to determine the functional significance of positioning specific genome regions at the edge of the nucleus in mammalian cells. The nuclear periphery has conventionally been considered as a zone of inactive chromatin and transcriptional repression. Several regulatory gene loci move away from the nuclear periphery as they are activated during differentiation. Novel approaches, developed by ourselves and others, that allow genomic regions to be relocated from the centre of the nucleus to the periphery, have directly shown that proximity to the nuclear edge can down-regulate human gene expression. We propose to dissect the pathways that mediate this spatially-defined transcriptional regulation, to determine what features make certain genes susceptible to it, to establish the functional consequences of preventing gene repositioning during differentiation, and to examine defects of the periphery found in premature ageing. A neglected hypothesis is that positioning of inactive chromatin against the nuclear periphery is a mechanism to minimize DNA damage on sequences in the nuclear centre. We will determine whether mutation rate is altered when loci are repositioned towards the nuclear periphery. By experimentally remodelling the spatial organisation of the genome, this proposal goes beyond the current descriptive phase of 3D nuclear organisation, into an understanding of its functional consequences on multiple aspects of genome function. It will also aid in understanding human diseases characterised by alterations of the nuclear periphery.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,701,090</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-02-29</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="FutureGenes"><Rcn>94580</Rcn><Nid>8988</Nid><HI>Ita-Suomen Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Gene transfer techniques in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and malignant glioma</Name><PI>Seppo Yla-Herttuala</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Background: Poor angiogenesis and collateral vessel formation lead to coronary heart disease, claudication, infarctions and amputations while malignant glioma is one of the most aggressive proangiogenic tumors leading to death in a few months. For these diseases either stimulation or blocking, respectively, of angiogenesis may provide novel treatment options. Advancing State-of-the-Art: Our hypothesis is that in ischemia it will be possible to support natural growth of blood vessels with Therapeutic angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by using local gene transfer of the new members of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and their receptors. New co-receptors, designer mutants and PCR suffling products of VEGFs will be used. New vector technology will be used to achieve long-lasting effects of VEGFs. We aim to develop novel site-specifically integrating, targeted, regulated vectors to precisely express the new VEGFs, their soluble decoy receptors and single-chain therapeutic antibodies (scFv) for pro- and anti-angiogenic purposes.

A particular rhythm, hippocampal theta oscillations (6-10Hz), links two ways of coding by which pyramidal cells in the hippocampus represent space, namely rate and phase coding. Thus, the theta cycle provides a clock against which the increased firing rate of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is measured. Furthermore, hippocampal theta is believed to constitute a link to episodic memory. Recent evidence from our lab indicates that recruitment of GABAergic interneurones critically affects certain aspects of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory in mice. We have established genetic tools that allow us to manipulate GABAergic interneurones in a cell type and region-specific manner. In combination with in vivo electrophysiology in the hippocampus/entorhinal cortex and behavioural studies, we will investigate how GABAergic interneurones regulate the activity in neuronal networks and contribute to behaviour. Specifically, we will address the following questions: 1) How does reduced recruitment of GABAergic interneurones affect network activity (theta oscillations)? 2) How does altered activity of GABAergic interneurones affect spatial representation (activity of place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex)? 3) How does modified activity in the hippocampus affect activity in the entorhinal cortex (and vice versa)? 4) How does modified network activity and spatial representation translate into spatial memory? The interdisciplinary approach will enable us to provide better insight into how cellular activity of GABAergic interneurones relates to network activity and ultimately to behaviour.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,872,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GEMELLI"><Rcn>94577</Rcn><Nid>12075</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Gene networks controlling embryonic polarity, regulation and twinning"</Name><PI>Claudio Daniel Stern</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Much of what we know about how embryos determine their axes of symmetry comes from research in invertebrates (mainly Drosophila) and cold-blooded vertebrates (mainly Xenopus). In both cases, polarity is set up by the localisation of maternal determinants in the cytoplasm of the fertilised egg. These determinants are inherited differentially by daughter cells, leading them to acquire different fates, which effectively fixes the axes of the embryo by the 8 cell stage. In contrast, in amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals) embryonic polarity remains plastic until much later, just before gastrulation, when the embryo may contain as many as 50,000 cells. If an embryo at this stage is cut into fragments, each fragment can generate a complete embryo. This property, called "embryonic regulation", is thought to be responsible for the generation of monozygotic (identical) and conjoined ( Siamese ) twins in humans and other amniotes.

This project will lead to an unparalleled advance in understanding of the world&#226;&#128;&#153;s most serious crop disease - rice blast.  Each year rice blast disease claims 11-30% of the potential rice harvest, which is enough rice to feed 60 million people. The fungus that causes rice blast disease, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a highly adapted cereal pathogen, which forms specialized infection structures called appressoria that can breach the intact leaf surface and allow the fungus entry to living plant tissue. This project will result in the most comprehensive understanding of the biology of plant infection by a pathogenic fungus. The cross-disciplinary research programme will integrate next generation DNA sequencing, digital transcriptional profiling, and high throughput gene functional analysis, with cell biology and live cell imaging. In this way, the transcriptional networks and gene regulators of fungal virulence will be identified and characterized at a systems level. The project will investigate the nature of the host-pathogen interface using live cell imaging of stable transgenic rice lines expressing fluorescent fusion proteins that define specific sub-cellular domains and will allow the precise mechanism of cellular invasion by the fungus to be determined.  The project will also use protein-protein interaction studies to identify the major effectors used by M. oryzae to suppress plant immunity and facilitate proliferation of the fungus within living plant tissue. In parallel, comparative genome analysis will define conserved the full repertoire of effector functions and the transcriptional networks necessary for plant disease. Comprehensive functional analysis of M. oryzae effectors will then be carried out by targeted gene deletion, spatial localization and target identification."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,733</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GENCON"><Rcn>102609</Rcn><Nid>10569</Nid><HI>Uppsala Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>The evolutionary implications of genetic conflict</Name><PI>G&#195;&#182;ran Arnqvist</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The study of genetic conflict is developing at an almost explosive rate. The recognition that genes or alleles residing in individuals of the two sexes may have conflicting interests is transforming evolutionary biology and, likewise, conflict between genes showing different modes of transmission may fundamentally affect adaptive evolution. The research proposed here will push the frontiers of genetic conflict research and establish new domains. It is aimed at exploring the novel possibility that conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear genes have far-reaching implications for adaptive evolution and at advancing our understanding of the biological consequences of sexual conflict. The project consists of several interrelated parts and will employ insects as model systems. First, I will assess to what extent genetic variation in fitness is sexually antagonistic and what life history traits contribute to sexually antagonistic variation. Second, I will elucidate the genomics of metabolic rate and measure selection on metabolic phenotypes. Third, I will test whether sexually antagonistic epistatic interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genes generate conflict over metabolic rate. Fourth, I will test the hypothesis that sexual conflict contribute to the evolution of primary and secondary sexual traits.

The cerebral cortex has evolved rapidly in size and complexity in the hominid lineage, which is likely linked to quantitative and qualitative divergence in patterns of cortical development.
On the other hand, comparative genomics has revealed recently the existence of a number of ""hominid-specific"" genes, which constitute attractive candidates to underlie critical aspects of human brain evolution, but their function remains essentially unexplored, mostly because of the lack of appropriate experimental systems.

Here we propose to test a simple and radical hypothesis: that key species-specific features of the development of the human cerebral cortex, in particular the generation and differentiation of pyramidal neurons, are linked functionally to the emergence of hominid-specific (HS) genes controlling corticogenesis.

To achieve this high risk / high gain goal, we will first determine which HS genes are expressed in the human developing cortex in vivo, using a combination of genome-wide and in situ gene detection analyses, in order to select those most likely to impact corticogenesis.
The function of candidate HS genes will be determined using innovative models of human corticogenesis based on pluripotent stem cells, developed recently in our laboratory, as well as ex vivo cultures of human fetal cortex. In addition, the developmental and evolutionary impact of HS genes will be examined in a non-hominid context, the mouse embryonic cortex.

By identifying the function of hominid-specific genes in cortical developpment, we will uncover specific genetic mechanisms linking functionally the development and evolution of the human brain, with broad implications in neurobiology, developmental and evolutionary biology."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,473,937</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GENE TARGET T2D"><Rcn>98878</Rcn><Nid>12127</Nid><HI>Lunds Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>General and targeted approaches to unravel the molecular causes of type 2 diabetes</Name><PI>Leif Christer Groop</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects worldwide at present about 250 million patients and an estimated 380 million in 2025. This epidemic has been ascribed to a collision between genes and an affluent society. Genetics of T2D has during recent years identified &gt; 30 variants increasing susceptibility to T2D. Yet, these variants explain only 15% of the heritability of T2D. One reason could be that whole genome association studies can only detect common variants whereas identification of rare variants with stronger effects would require sequencing. A large part of this application is devoted to sequencing of affected family members from unique large pedigrees traced back to common ancestors around 1600. The advantage of using families is that identified variants can be tested for segregation with the trait. Genetic variants can influence expression of a gene in an allele specific manner. This will be explored by combining exome sequencing with sequencing of RNA from human islets.
Impaired effects of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP on the pancreatic islets represent central defects in T2D. Variants in the TCF7L2 and GIPR genes contribute to these defects. I will here explore the molecular mechanisms by which TCF7L2, the strongest T2D gene, causes T2D. GIP has unprecedented effects not only on islet function but also on body composition, blood flow and vascular complications in T2D. This application explores these effects and will test whether manipulation of GIP can mimic the normalization of glucose tolerance seen after gastric bypass surgery.
Taken together, these general and targeted approaches are expected not only to provide new insights into the causes of T2D but also contribute with vital information for development of new treatments for T2D."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,480</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GENECADD"><Rcn>98152</Rcn><Nid>11864</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>GEnetic NEtworks as a tool for anti-CAncer Drug Development</Name><PI>Ulf Thomas Edvard Helleday</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Although several therapies target cellular pathways, current small molecules drug discovery is based on identification of inhibitors to single proteins, without knowledge of whether they are the most advantageous target.

This method will enable identification of numerous distinct inhibitors of a particular pathway, as well as providing their molecular mechanism.

Cancer cells harbour gene mutations that make them more reliant on other cellular pathways for survival. Such cellular pathways can be targeted to selectively kill the cancer cells using the concept of synthetic lethality. In this project we want to identify inhibitors of homologous recombination to target cancer using synthetic lethality.

To establish a functional genetic network for homologous recombination, we will first identify all recombination proteins using multiple genome-wide RNAi screens. Then the synthetic sick or lethal interaction map between all recombination proteins is determined by co-depletion of these. Such synthetic sick or lethal network will identify numerous putative targets for anti-cancer treatment. Importantly, using this network for chemical-genetic functional interactions will assist in determinating of the molecular mechanisms of inhibitors.

In the late 1990s, we felt that the challenges associated with understanding mammalian mtDNA gene expression could only be tackled by a broad interdisciplinary scientific approach. We therefore started collaboration between the Larsson (expertise in mouse genetics, in vivo physiology and cell biology) and Gustafsson laboratories (expertise in biochemistry, recombinant in vitro systems, structural biology) that has been ongoing for more than a decade. The success of this collaborative effort is documented by many joint publications in high-profile journals.

In our own history, mutations that duplicate genes have generated extensive multigene families and classes, including a great diversity of transcriptional regulators involved in development of cells, tissues and organs. For example, two complete genome duplication events occurred in early vertebrate evolution (known as 2R), a third genome duplication occurred at the base of teleost fish (3R), and there were extensive tandem gene duplications in placental mammals. What role did these events play in animal evolution? How do newly duplicate genes diverge in function? Why do tandem gene duplicates evolve in a different way to whole genome duplicates? The proposed research programme aims to resolve these questions. The long-term functional consequences of duplication will be examined by examining how the spectrum of target genes differs, or overlaps, between transcription factors known to have duplicated in the 2R and 3R events. To understand the earliest stages of duplicate gene evolution gene sequences and gene expression will be studied in a spectrum of animals descendent from much more recent genome duplications, including several freshwater fish and desert-living rodents. The contrast between whole genome and tandem gene duplication will be examined in parallel, through genomic and protein-engineering studies of novel homeobox genes that arose in mammalian evolution.

Here, I propose to use genomic and epigenetic tools to provide a new perspective on the biology of animal welfare. This will reveal mechanisms involved in modulating stress responses. Groundbreaking aspects include new insights into how environmental conditions shape the orchestration of the genome by means of epigenetic mechanisms, and how this in turn modulates coping patterns of animals. The flexible epigenome comprises the interface between the environment and the genome. It is involved in both short- and long-term, including transgenerational, adaptations of animals. Hence, populations may adapt to environmental conditions over generations, using epigenetic mechanisms. The project will primarily be based on chickens, but will also be extended to a novel species, the dog. We will generate congenic chicken strains, where interesting alleles and epialleles will be fixed against a common background of either RJF or domestic genotypes. In these, we will apply a broad phenotyping strategy, to characterize the effects on different welfare relevant behaviors. Furthermore, we will characterize how environmental stress affects the epigenome of birds, and tissue samples from more than 500 birds from an intercross between RJF and White Leghorn layers will be used to perform an extensive meth-QTL-analysis. This will reveal environmental and genetic mechanisms affecting gene-specific methylation. The dog is another highly interesting species in the context of behavior genetics, because of its high inter-breed variation in behavior, and its compact and sequenced genome. We will set up a large-scale F2-intercross experiment and phenotype about 400 dogs in standardized behavioral tests.

Over the last century, evidence has accumulated indicating that TB is also a genetic disease. However, the molecular basis of predisposition to TB remains elusive, and efforts to understand the pathogenesis of TB are of prime importance if we are to combat this major killer of mankind. The PI proposes an integrated and innovative research program aiming to identify the genetic variants controlling the critical steps of the process from exposure to Mtb to development of TB. In addition to investigating the two key clinical phenotypes - the development of disseminated TB in children and of pulmonary TB in adults - this program proposes to undertake the first comprehensive genetic dissection of resistance to Mtb infection. Making use of the latest conceptual and technical breakthroughs in human genetics, the strategy will combine Mendelian and complex genetics approaches, including genome-wide (GW) investigations (GW linkage and association studies, whole-exome sequencing). The strengths of this innovative, ground-breaking project lie in its bold hypothesis, the high quality of our clinical samples, and the extensive experience of our laboratory in human genetics of mycobacterial infections in terms of genetic epidemiology, molecular genetics, and immunology. The identification of the main variants controlling TB development will have major implications for TB control, both in the definition of new prevention strategies (design of vaccine research and clinical trials) and in the development of new treatments (aiming to restore deficient immune responses).

During the formation of the immune synapse (IS), diverse transmembrane and membrane associated molecules are reorganized into a highly segregated structure at the T cell&#226;&#128;&#147;Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC) contact site. As part of this process, the tubulin cytoskeleton is vectorially directed toward the center of the IS, where the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) localizes. MTOC translocation is an early event in IS formation that brings the secretory apparatus into close apposition with the APC, thus providing the basis for polarized secretion.

The proposal aims to define how the MTOC controls cytoskeletal rearrangement and communication at the IS, as a mechanism for macromolecule transport and nucleation of signalling molecules during synaptic contact. We will study the mechanisms of MTOC-mediated polarization of multivesicular bodies (MVB) and exosome delivery during IS formation, and will assess the role in these processes of MTOC translocation regulators (HDAC6) and microtubule (MT) polymerization promoters (Plk1 and EB1). MTOC-dependent mitochondrial polarization to the IS will be assessed as a bioenergetic source for cytoskeletal rearrangements, IS maturation and polarized exosomal delivery. In particular, our proposed study of the possible horizontal transfer of miRNAs during cognate interactions between immune cells has the potential to reveal how miRNAs can control the early initiation of immunity. We will investigate the mechanism of directional transfer of RNA-harbouring exosomes at the IS from T cell to APC, and will examine the functional consequences of this transfer on APC biology and on the immune response. These studies will open avenues for the treatment of immune-related diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,011,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GEPIDIAB"><Rcn>105825</Rcn><Nid>11763</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Genetics and epigenetics of Type 2 Diabetes physiology</Name><PI>Philippe Froguel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Failure to elucidate Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) physiology frustrates efforts to improve therapeutics.

Elucidating the genetics of familial early-onset T2D, using Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) can bring breakthroughs in understanding insulin secretion physiology. DNA methylation, particularly in insulin sensitive tissues may also contribute to T2D. Newly-developed genome-wide methylation arrays can be used to identify  associations with these epigenetic elements and T2D.

In WP1, unresolved MODY-X families will be studied  using WES to identify novel sequence changes.

In WP2, variation in DNA methylation at 450K sites across the genome will be studied in normoglycemic or diabetic bariatric surgery patients. Five separate tissue samples will be studied to identify tissue-specific variation, individual-specific variation and that which varies between cases and controls. We will explore whether there are T2D-specific patterns of methylation that are distinct from those in lean or obese normoglycemic subjects using bisulfite-whole genome sequencing.

Dendritic Cells (DC) have shown potential to induce antigen specific CD8+ T-cell responses with the help of CD4+ T cells, yet the efficacy by which the induction is achieved still has its limitations. The main challenge is: (a) to increase targeting efficacy to the complete repertoire of DC subsets; (b) to trigger T-cell responses by the DC that is powerful enough to eliminate a tumour (c) to implement novel human read-out systems, that mimic he human body response to evaluate vaccine efficacy.

The aim of this research project is to develop new glycan-based nanomedicines targeted to DC to induce powerful T-cell responses. Within the scope of this research project these new glycan-based nanomedicines will be tested to (i) trigger a strong T-cell response to pathogens, (ii) induce a powerful and adequate T-cell response to self antigen in a tumour induced immune suppressive environment and (iii) render fundamental insights to establish a vaccine platform relevant for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.

GlycoTreat employs an unconventional, novel glycan biotechnology approach to target a multitude of DC subsets in the human skin to validate the groundbreaking hypothesis that the local administration and molecular size and glycan valency of the targeting compound affect the efficiency of the T-cell stimulating vaccine. This research project joins the chemical design of glyco-nanomedical vaccines with immunological outcomes in our advanced in-vitro, in-situ human skin and in-vivo mouse DC model systems.

The overall objective is to decipher how function is coded, divided and integrated among components of the grid-cell circuit of the medial entorhinal cortex and associated regions. Using a combination of transgenic interventions, intracellular recording and multisite multichannel tetrode recording, we shall establish the mechanisms by which grid cells organize into functionally independent modules, as well as the factors specifying quantitative relationships between grid modules. We shall determine how grid modules are formed during development, test the hypothesis that grid patterns are derived from the local recurrent inhibitory network in layer II, and establish how spatial signals in the entorhinal cortex are transformed to place-cell signals in the hippocampus.

The current multidisciplinary proposal integrates expertise identified as essential in the effective acceleration of research to overcome bottlenecks in the field including: 1) Inefficiency of therapy delivery to the CNS because of factors like the blood-brain barrier (BBB); 2) Poor understanding of disease mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels. These problems must be overcome to develop fully effective treatments for neurological disorders. Currently the adeno-associated (AAV)-based system is one of the most refined and effective gene delivery systems for neuronal cells. In contrast to all other systems, it has been possible to engineer AAV9 to deliver genes through the BBB to the CNS by intravascular (IV) administration. However, following IV delivery, these vectors also target liver and other tissues, with significant potential for untoward effects. This has prompted us to adopt two major strategies: i) targeting of AAV9 vectors at the level of transcription by insertion of hybrid motor neuron specific promoters into the vector genome; ii) development of a CNS-targeted delivery approach based on state-of-the art nanoparticle-mediated encapsulation of AAV9 vectors.  We anticipate that engineering strategies with the ability to restrict transgene expression to CNS tissue will significantly overcome various existing hurdles in CNS gene therapy development. Our objectives are to: 1) explore mechanisms leading to penetration of scAAV9 vectors through BBB since the exact mechanism of AAV9 diffusion through BBB is unknown; 2) design novel targeted strategies with enhanced tropism to CNS; 3) use CNS targeted vectors to investigate mechanisms of motor neuron death linked to mutations in RNA processing genes; 4) utilise CNS-targeted systems to test therapeutic strategies for motor neuron diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,959</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GalectCompart"><Rcn>185432</Rcn><Nid>12357</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Endocytic Membrane Compartmentalization by Galectins</Name><PI>Ludger Johannes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The contribution of clathrin-independent endocytosis to the cellular entry of signaling receptors, cell adhesion factors, and other cell surface molecules is well documented. However, how this process is initiated is still unknown. We have recently found that a cellular lectin, galectin-3 (Gal3), entered cells via morphologically distinct tubular structures, so-called clathrin-independent carriers (CLICs); Gal3 endocytosis was required for the uptake of the CLIC cargo CD44, a cell adhesion/migration factor; CD44 and Gal3 uptake required glycosphingolipids (GSLs); Gal3 induced tubular membrane invaginations in a GSL-dependent manner. Based on these findings we propose the groundbreaking hypothesis that Gal3 is an adaptor that clusters cargo proteins carrying defined carbohydrate modifications together with specific GSLs into nanoscale membrane environments whose mechanical properties drive the clathrin-independent formation of endocytic pits. In this program, we will first establish the compositional topology of endocytic galectin processes (Aim 1). The adaptor hypothesis will then be tested using innovative chemical biology tools (Aim 2). Quantitative models of cargo clustering and membrane shape changes will be developed on the basis of biophysical measurements and coarse grain simulations (Aim 3). Intravital imaging of endocytosis and cell migration in mice will finally explore how the functional link between galectins and GSLs contributes to wound healing in the colon (Aim 4). The molecular functions of galectins and GSLs in endocytosis &#226;&#128;&#148; major unresolved questions in cellular membrane biology &#226;&#128;&#148; will thereby be established, providing details from atomic arrangements via multi-molecular complexes and meso-scaled membrane domains to in vivo physiology. I am confident that this program will lead to the discovery of a new clathrin-independent endocytic mechanism by which different types of cargo are sorted to and internalized from specific membrane domains.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,270,054</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GenAdap"><Rcn>105036</Rcn><Nid>11472</Nid><HI>Universitat Konstanz, Germany</HI><Name>Comparative genomics of parallel evolution in repeated adaptive radiations</Name><PI>Axel Meyer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Darwin suggested that natural selection not only leads to adaptation but also promotes the origin of species. Ecological speciation acts through divergent natural selection and one of the most informative circumstances in which one can investigate how adaptive traits and how species evolve &#226;&#128;&#147; and what the genetic basis of species differences and adaptations are - are repeated adaptive radiations that are based on parallel adaptations that evolved more than once. In only a few species has the genetic basis of adaptations been identified so far. It is not generally known what portion of the genome, what kind of genes and what kind of genetic changes cause adaptations. The investigation of the genetics of species formation and adaptations requires the comparative investigation of genetic divergence in the entire genome. This is now possible by applying recent methods in next-generation sequencing technology to a tractable group of closely related species that vary in how far speciation and adaptive divergence has proceeded. In the crater lakes of Nicaragua a natural experiment is taken place where several adaptive radiations of cichlid fish formed independently from two large source lakes within only a few thousand years. These extremely young adaptive radiations consist of species that arose in sympatry and evolved parallel adaptations repeatedly in their new habitats. We will investigate the mechanisms of natural selection and identify the genetic basis of species differences and parallel adaptations  - they could be standing genetic variation or repeated de novo mutations - through comparative genomic analyses that will include the establishing of a reference genome, genome resequencing, QTL analyses, population genomics, and linkage and association maps. Then we could test the causal relationship between identified candidate genes and the phenotypic differences and parallel adaptations through functional analyses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,338,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GeneNoiseControl"><Rcn>102227</Rcn><Nid>11573</Nid><HI>Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie Van Wetenschappen - Knaw, Netherlands</HI><Name>Controlling stochastic gene expression during development and stem cell differentiation</Name><PI>Alexander Van Oudenaarden</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The phenotypic differences between individual organisms can often be ascribed to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical organisms in homogenous environments vary, suggesting that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. My laboratory has intensively studied stochastic gene expression in microbial systems and more recently started to apply these concepts to multicellular organisms and stem cells. One of the major lessons learned from our work and others is that microbial systems tend to exploit stochastic gene expression by introducing phenotypic diversity into the population. However it is an open question whether stochastic gene expression benefits or hinders decision-making by cells in a developing embryo. On the one hand, the gene expression patterns of different cells during metazoan development must be aligned either to ensure proper tissue formation or maintain a coordinated timing of developmental events. This suggests that stochastic fluctuations in gene expression may be controlled or their effects may be buffered under normal conditions. On the other hand, stem cells might use fluctuations to prime differentiation. A stem cell might continuously fluctuate between different primed states each biased towards a different germ layer fate. As soon as an external differentiation signal appears the cell would rapidly differentiate towards the fate that was stochastically selected. The overarching goal of this proposal is to the understand how stochastic gene expression is controlled, or utilized, during development and stem cell differentiation using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and murine embryonic stem cells as experimental model systems. To obtain this goal we will use a combination of quantitative experiments, theoretical and computational approaches, and the development of novel technology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GlycoPOISE"><Rcn>107288</Rcn><Nid>10878</Nid><HI>University Of York, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Glycosylation: Programmes for Observation, Inhibition and Structure-based Exploitation of key carbohydrate-active enzymes</Name><PI>Gideon John Davies</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The development of new approaches to dissect the diverse roles for carbohydrates in living cells is a major challenge for modern cell biology.

We aim to create a systems-level understanding of the cell cycle, and its regulation by physiological growth factors and oncogenes through the use high-throughput biology to identify all or the majority of genes that are essential for cell cycle progression, and by combining this dataset with computationally predicted and experimentally validated target genes of growth factors and oncogenic pathways. In my opinion, such systems biology approach is critical for understanding of growth control, as organ-specific growth control has proven particularly refractory to genetic dissection. Much of what we know about physiological mechanisms controlling cellular growth in mammals has been revealed by human cancer genetics. These studies have revealed that a large number of genes can contribute to aberrant cell growth; there are more than 300 genes that have been linked to cancer, and mutations found in cancer are often cell type specific ( oncogene preference , i.e. PTCH mutations in medulloblastoma, APC in colon cancer, TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer), suggesting that different pathways in different cell lineages are coupled to the cell cycle machinery. We have preliminary evidence that hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signals are directly coupled to expression of N-myc and c-Myc genes, but only in tissues and cell-types that display a proliferative response to these factors. Both classical molecular and developmental biology as well as high throughput and systems biological methods will be used for dissection of the molecular mechanism of this selectivity. If successful, these experiments would establish a principle explaining why particular mutations are extremely common in some tumor types but not found at all in others.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,200,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="GutDroso"><Rcn>90145</Rcn><Nid>8777</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Gut immunity and homeostasis in Drosophila</Name><PI>Bruno Lemaitre</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The gut is the major interface between microbes and their animal hosts and constitutes the main entry route for pathogens. As a consequence gut cells must be armed with efficient immune defenses to combat invasion and colonisation by pathogens.  However, the gut also harbors a flora of commensal bacteria, with potentially beneficial effects for the host, which must be tolerated without a chronic, and harmful, immune response.  In recent years Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model to dissect host-pathogen interactions, leading to the paradigm of antimicrobial peptide regulation by the Toll and Imd signaling pathways.  The strength of this model derives from the availability of powerful and cost effective genetic and genomic tools as well as the high degree of similarities to vertebrate innate immunity.  However, in spite of growing interest in gut mucosal immunity generally, very little is known about the immune response of the Drosophila gut.  Using powerful new tools and those developed in the study of the systemic response, we propose to raise our understanding of Drosophila gut immunity to the same level as that of systemic immunity within the next five years. This project will involve integrated approaches to dissect not only the gut immune response but also gut homeostasis in the presence of commensal microbiota, as well as strategies used by entomopathogens to circumvent these defenses. We believe that the fundamental knowledge generated on Drosophila gut immunity will serve as a paradigm of epithelial immune reactivity and have a wider impact on our comprehension of animal defense mechanisms.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,485,627</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HAIRBUNDLE"><Rcn>106054</Rcn><Nid>12807</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Assembling the puzzle of the operating auditory hair bundle</Name><PI>Christine Petit</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The hair bundles of the sensory cells play a central role in the processing of sounds by the cochlea. Various performances of auditory perception depend upon what biophysical and physiological environment the operating hair bundle can provide to its mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels. The project aims at building a more integrated view of the way the hair bundle works. Reaching this goal, requires to understand the interdependence of its functional building blocks and their dynamic interplay.
To this purpose, the objectives of the work are :
1. To assemble components of the basal MET machinery
The work aims at
a)  identifying the molecular players of the basal MET machinery, most of which are still unknown
b)  deciphering their functional interactions,
c)	  developing a simple and efficient tool to validate candidate components of the MET machinery.
2. To elucidate the coupling between MET and stereocilia F-actin polymerisation
The work aims at
a)	   characterising this coupling, both in development and in steady-state condition,
b)	   deciphering the role of tip-link tension and Ca+2 influx through the MET channel,
c)	   developing a coarse-grained mathematical model of this coupling, experimentally testable.
3. To understand the interplay between MET, waveform distortions, and masking
The work aims at
a)	   deciphering biochemical characteristics of the top connectors,
b)	  explaining why large waveform distortions vanish in the absence of top connectors,
c)	  determining how the operating outer hair cell (OHC) hair bundle contributes to the masking        effect in auditory perception.
The hair bundle is a highly vulnerable structure, actually the main target structure of noise-induced hearing loss and hereditary deafness forms. As such, advances in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying its functioning will pave the way for the development of therapeutic approaches.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HAPLOID"><Rcn>111071</Rcn><Nid>10139</Nid><HI>Institut Fuer Molekulare Biotechnologie Gmbh, Austria</HI><Name>&#226;&#128;&#156;Yeast&#226;&#128;&#157; genetics in mammalian cells to identify fundamental mechanisms of physiology and pathophysiology</Name><PI>Josef Penninger</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Some organisms such as yeast or social insects are haploid, i.e. they carry a single set of chromosomes. Organisms with a single copy of their genome provide a basis for genetic analyses where any recessive mutation of essential genes will show a clear phenotype due to the absence of a second gene copy. Recessive genetic screens have markedly contributed to our understanding of normal development, basic physiology, and disease. However, all somatic mammalian cells carry two copies of chromosomes (diploidy) that obscure mutational screens. Although deemed impossible, we were able to develop generate mammalian haploid embryonic stem cells, thereby breaking a paradigm of biology.

Our novel stem opens the possibility of combining the power of a haploid genome with pluripotency of embryonic stem cells to uncover fundamental biological processes in defined cell types at a genomic scale. The following projects are proposed:

1. Towards&#226;&#128;&#156;yeast&#226;&#128;&#157; genetics in mammalian stem cells. Development of optimized technologies for rapid, genome-wide screens via repairable mutagenesis. Mutational bar-coding to introduce quantitative genomics to mammalian biology.
2. Forward genetic screens to uncover essential stem cell genes, identify novel stemness factors, develop improved systems for iPS cell derivation, and to perform synthetic lethal screens for anti-cancer drugs.
3. Reverse genetics using to identify and validate genes involved in cardiovascular physiology, brown and white fat cell development, and pain sensing.
4. Hit validation &#226;&#128;&#147; exemplified by resistance to the bioweapon ricin.

Haploid embryonic stem cells carry the promise to revolutionize functional genetics and allow rapid, near whole genome-wide mutational forward genetics analysis and reverse genetics in defined cell types.

Since the use of chemical products to treat worms is not sustainable in the long term because of the continual emergence of drug-resistant parasites and consumer concerns about what they eat, control by vaccines is the most appropriate way forward. However, there are presently no vaccines for any animal or human helminth pathogen.
We hypothesise that the ability of helminth parasites to suppress the protective arm of the immune response explains why we have been unsuccessful in developing efficacious vaccines against these pathogens. During helminth infection the function of innate immune cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, is manipulated by the parasite to create a T helper (Th) cell 2-driven immune response that is beneficial to its survival, while simultaneously suppressing the immunoprotective Th1-driven response. This helminth-induced immune modulation is induced by the secretion of specific parasite immunomodulatory molecules.
Focusing on the helminth that causes animal and human fascioliasis (liver fluke disease), we will &#226;&#128;&#152;turn-the-table&#226;&#128;&#153; on this parasite by targeting its immunomodulatory mechanisms and develop vaccine formulations that induce potent protective Th1-inducing humoral and cellular immune responses.
The project involves both innovative and discovery approaches in the search for novel helminth immunomodulatory molecules, and a translational element that will bring these findings into a useful veterinary medicine application for the end-users, farmers and consumers. The breakthrough of this project, therefore, will not only be the development of a vaccine against liver fluke disease, but also the opening of a new route towards the control of many other major helminth pathogens of both animals and humans."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,333</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HEP"><Rcn>110229</Rcn><Nid>10242</Nid><HI>Institut Du Cerveau Et De La Moelle &#195;&#137;pini&#195;&#168;re, France</HI><Name>"Epilepsies of the temporal lobe: emergence, basal state and paroxysmal transitions"</Name><PI>Richard Miles</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"This proposal focuses on a human disease: epilepsy of the temporal lobe.

HCV-induced end-stage liver disease such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma represent a major concern in global health. Treatment options for chronic hepatitis C are limited and no vaccine against HCV infection is available. Vaccine development is hampered by several obstacles. High viral variability and escape from host immune responses render antigen selection a major challenge. Antigen selection requires thorough studies to identify conserved T cell and neutralization epitopes and to decipher neutralization mechanisms, aiming to discover the optimal viral target for immune responses counteracting HCV escape strategies. At the same time it is important to develop antigen presentation systems that are efficient in patients with impaired antiviral immune responses, as often observed during chronic hepatitis C. While most vaccine development programs are based on improving HCV cellular immunity, it is essential to associate, in a same vaccine formulation, immunogens able to induce broad spectrums neutralizing and cellular responses. Owing to recent progresses in the field, here we propose a project aiming to overcome the current limitations in vaccine development by addressing the improvement of B cell responses targeting HCV infection. This will be achieved by a detailed investigation of: 1) mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization and escape, 2) impact of lipoproteins associating with the viral particle during assembly/release and counteracting neutralization and 3) cell entry steps that can potentially be targeted by antibodies, including those that are not induced naturally. Thus, through the combined expertise of the team in molecular virology, immunology, clinical hepatology and vectorology, we aim to rationalize the development of B cell immunogens and neutralizing antibodies for novel antiviral immunopreventive strategies targeting HCV infection.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,447,357</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HERA"><Rcn>94394</Rcn><Nid>12283</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Host-environment interactions in the protection from asthma and allergies</Name><PI>Erika Von Mutius</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Asthma and allergies are chronic conditions affecting billions of Europeans. These complex diseases are determined by interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Treatments can control symptoms, but cannot cure or prevent the diseases. I, and my team, have shown that children are strongly protected from asthma and allergies when growing up in a farming environment rich in microbial exposures: the prevalence of asthma and hay fever is reduced over 5 fold. We have shown that environmental exposure to microbial compounds is inversely related to asthma and allergies. We have isolated microbes from animal sheds which protect mice from allergic airway inflammation. My team is now at a critical point to move this work forward to the next step, which is to systematically identify the microbes and their immuno-stimulatory compounds that protect from asthma and allergies. We have key resources in hand. In previous population based studies large numbers of environmental samples from farm and non farm children with and without asthma and allergies have been stored in biobanks. Genome wide genotyping data have also been gathered. The HERA project aims at applying the latest innovative high throughput sequencing techniques to comprehensively characterize the microbial ecology of these environmental samples. New methods for assessing microbial immuno-stimulatory substances will be used. These innovations will allow the HERA team to identify distinct asthma and allergy protective microbial exposures taking each individual s genetic susceptibility into account. Once protective microbial exposures have been identified, the responsible substances can be isolated. These substances can be developed into novel and effective prevention strategies to combat the asthma and allergy epidemic.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,155,697</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HIIS"><Rcn>90769</Rcn><Nid>9065</Nid><HI>Humanitas Mirasole Spa, Italy</HI><Name>The humoral innate immune system: long pentraxins as a paradigm</Name><PI>Alberto Mantovani</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The innate immune system consists of humoral and a cellular arm, but attention has largely been focused on cells and their receptors. The humoral innate immune system (HIIS) is generally represented as  a collection of diverse molecules (collectins, ficolins, pentraxins).

This general view will be put to a test capitalizing on the discovery by the applicant of the long pentraxin family, the prototype of which is PTX3.   PTX3 is a multifunctional fluid phase pattern recognition receptor, highly conserved in evolution, at the interface between innate immunity/ inflammation and female fertility /matrix remodelling.

We have demonstrated that HIV-1 replicates in primary human macrophages without triggering interferon production. However, by specific mutation of HIV-1 proteins or by manipulating interaction with host cofactors we can reveal the virus to innate immune receptors and activate an antiviral response leading to secretion of soluble type 1 interferon and cessation of replication. We propose to define the sensors and the details of the antiviral pathways that are activated in macrophages using proven RNA interference techniques reading out activation of innate immune responses by measurement of secreted interferon and induction of gene expression. We have also characterised small molecules that potently inhibit HIV-1 by revealing HIV-1 to innate immune sensors. In collaboration with crystallographers and medicinal chemists we aim to improve the potency and specificity of these drugs and to use them to study the anti-HIV-1 innate immune response. DC are sentinels of innate immunity and their infection induced maturation leads to interferon production and DC dependent T cell maturation that defines the nature and potency of the immune response. We will examine the effect of triggering innate responses in DC using HIV-1 mutants/drug treated wild type virus on allogeneic responses, by measurement of T cell proliferation and function and in an ex vivo CD8 T cell killing assays using peripheral blood CD8 cells from HIV&#226;&#128;&#145;1 infected patients.

MS affects young adults and women twice as often as men. Neurological deficits cause substantial disability at an early age with high socioeconomic impact.

Both a complex genetic trait and environmental factors are involved in MS etiology. Similar to other autoimmune diseases it has been known for almost 40 years that certain HLA-class II genes, in MS the two DR15 alleles DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01, confer by far most of the genetic risk. Despite this clear role remarkably little is known about the functional contribution of these genes to MS pathogenesis, and this holds also true for all other T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. It is assumed that the DR15 alleles present peptides from organ-specific self-proteins to T cells and select an autoreactive CD4+ T cell repertoire that can be activated by certain environmental triggers. Interestingly, the effects of the three known environmental risk factors in MS, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), low vitamin D3 and smoking, are all amplified by DR15.

This core issue of research on autoimmune diseases and also MS, how disease-associated HLA-class II molecules contribute to disease development at the functional level, will be studied with state-of-the-art methodologies and a series of novel approaches. These will include in silico modeling approaches, studies of self-peptides, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and HLA-DR/peptide complexes, clonally expanded T cells from MS brain tissue and hypothesis-open methods such as combinatorial chemistry and tissue-derived cDNA libraries to identify target antigens. Finally, translational studies will investigate the relationship between the above aspects and MS disease heterogeneity and explore antigen-specific tolerization in proof-of concept clinical trials in MS.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,368,068</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HOMEOEPITH"><Rcn>89139</Rcn><Nid>9356</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Homeostasis and rupture of the gut epithelium in the presence of commensals and pathogens</Name><PI>Philippe Sansonetti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The molecular cross talks occuring at the interface between the intestinal epithelium and bacterial flora will be studied at two levels : (i) how commensals and pathogens affect innate immune signalling, thereby leading to tolerance of the resident microbiota, and inflammatory rejection of the pathogens. The theme of commensals and pathogens regulating this innate response, particularly how they respectively strengthen or weaken the network of humoral and cellular epithelial defense systems will be central here. (ii) How, in molecular and cellular terms, bacteria affect epithelial renewal. The gut of a germ-free mouse and of a conventional mouse show dramatic differences marked by global immaturity and slow epithelial renewal in absence of flora. In front of pathogens, the actual role plaid in the disease in altering the kinetics of  epthelial repair is unknown. The aim of this project is to study how commensals and pathogens affect intestinal epithelial renewal, particularly the key steps of the whole developmental process such as lineages decisions, entry in cycle and proliferation, migration and final differentiation, decision to engage in cell death. In order to address these fundamental questions, we will study a commensal microorganism : Lactobacillus casei, and a pathogenic  microorganism : Shigella flexneri as model organism, and will develop several novel systems such as reverse genetics of Lactobacilli, development of intestinal crypt models in vitro to study bacterial interactions, and development of a mouse model showing susceptibility to  human-specific enteroinvasive pathogens.

The studies will concentrate on 4 HPs (Engrailed1/2, Otx2 and Pax6) illustrative of the HP family and of high physiological interest. Mouse lines will be developed in which the extracellular expression of single chain antibodies against these HPs can be induced at specific places and times, allowing us to follow the consequences of neutralizing extracellular HPs while preserving their cell autonomous functions. With this tool (and others) we shall study if (and how) HP transfer regulates boundary position in the neuroepithelium and direct cell/axon migration and guidance. In postnatal development, we will dissect how Otx2 regulates the opening, closure and reopening of critical periods in the cortex and controls the behavior of neuronal networks throughout life. Also in the adult we will follow how HPs regulate the physiology and survival of distinct neuronal groups, including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We shall analyze the physiological interactions between HPs and classical signaling molecules and identify HP targets, in particular those regulating the cell energy metabolism, and explore their ability to modulate the epigenetic state of the chromatin. Using Otx2 and Engrailed as baits, we shall identify the complex sugars with which they interact at the cell surface to get an entry into the ""sugar code"" that confers specificity to HP capture by distinct cell populations.

The light stage of this process is driven by two photosystems. Photosystem II (PSII) that oxidizes water to O2 and 4 H+ and photosystem I (PSI) which in the light provides the most negative redox potential in nature that can drive numerous reactions including CO2 assimilation and hydrogen (H2) production. The structure of most of the complexes involved in oxygenic photosynthesis was solved in several laboratories including our own. Utilizing our plant PSI crystals we were able to generate a light dependent electric potential of up to 100 V. We will develop this system for designing biological based photoelectric devices. Recently, we discovered a marine phage that carries an operon encoding all PSI subunits. Generation, in synechocystis, of a phage-like PSI enabled the mutated complex to accept electrons from additional sources like respiratory cytochromes. This way a novel photorespiration, where PSI can substitute for cytochrome oxidase, is created. The wild type and mutant synechocystis PSI were crystallized and solved, confirming the suggested structural consequences. Moreover, several structural alterations in the mesophilic PSI were recorded. We designed a hydrogen producing bioreactor where the novel photorespiration will enable to utilize the organic material of the cell as an electron source for H2 production. We propose that in conjunction of engineering a Cyanobacterium strain with a temperature sensitive PSII, enhancing rates in its respiratory chain an efficient and sustainable hydrogen production can be achieved.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,487,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HOTMEIOSIS"><Rcn>108400</Rcn><Nid>12707</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>"Meiotic recombination: How, where and why?

In most species, the absence of meiotic recombination leads to sterility. In addition, recombination generates new combinations of alleles, increases genome diversity and plays a major role in genome evolution.
Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but how these events are controlled at the molecular level and how they are constrained by selective pressures during evolution is not understood.
Our recent historical discovery that the Prdm9 gene controls the localization of recombination in the mouse and human genomes revolutionizes our view on this process, with one main unanticipated finding: the highly dynamic and fast evolution of Prdm9 and of meiotic DSB sites in the genome. Understanding meiotic recombination clearly requires the development of novel approaches to analyze this process from both molecular and evolutionary perspectives.

To this aim, we will develop an extensive analysis of Prdm9 as its activity, role, regulators and sites of action in the genome need to be identified and understood in order to gain insight into its dynamics and evolution.
We will develop a unique and challenging strategy to overcome the limitation of laboratory mice and pioneer the analysis of Prdm9 and recombination activity in wild mice.

We thus aim at making a breakthrough in the field by bringing molecular genetics and evolutionary biology together, to grasp the significance of meiotic recombination for genome evolution and sexual reproduction in eukaryotes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,899</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HUCNC"><Rcn>94708</Rcn><Nid>12071</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; De Gen&#195;&#168;ve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Conserved Non-Coding Sequences; function, variability and phenotypic consequences</Name><PI>Stylianos Antonarakis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Comparative genomics revealed that ~5% of the human genome is conserved among mammals. This fraction is likely functional, and could harbor pathogenic mutations.

Model organisms provided evidence for enhancer activity for a fraction of CNCs; in addition another fraction is part of large non-coding RNAs (lincRNA). However, the function of the majority of CNCs is unknown. Importantly, a few pathogenic mutations in CNCs have been associated with genetic disorders. We propose to i) perform functional analysis of CNCs, and ii) identify the spectrum of pathogenic CNC mutations in recognizable human phenotypes. The aims are: 1. Functional genomic connectivity of CNCs 1a. Use 4C in CNCs in various cell types and determine their physical genomic interactions. 1b.

diseases including atopy (i.e. atopic dermatitis, rhinitis, asthma) and more recently autoimmune diseases has
been the matter of extensive investigation. The aim of the present project is to validate this hypothesis
integrating epidemiological and experimental studies.
We will review in a meta-analysis published studies of direct and indirect markers of infections and atopic
diseases, and conduct a case-control study to analyse the association between infections and atopy using
atopic dermatitis as a prototypic model. This epidemiological study will assess the occurrence of different
infections and other risk factors related to the incidence of atopic dermatitis in children under age five in
Italy (300 cases and 600 controls).
This epidemiological study will be supported by experimental approaches addressing mechanistic questions
raised by the hygiene hypothesis. Experimental models will include induction of acute and chronic
bronchoconstriction/asthma, atopic dermatitis. In addition the project will aim at devising new mouse models
of atopy. The nature of infections providing protection against allergic diseases will be investigated to
characterise the difference at the molecular level between protective and non protective pathogens or their
derivatives. The underlying immune mechanisms notably homeostasis imbalance, antigenic competition,
stimulation of regulatory immune cells and Toll-like receptor involvement will be analysed. In addition to
developing integrated in vivo models, including the use of transgenic animals, efforts will be focussed on the
study of available synthetic pathogen-derived compounds showing a protective activity to better approach
their cellular and molecular mode of action. These studies may pave the way to novel and safe therapies that

Its determinants are remarkably complex.  Genetically engineered mice can model human cancers, with tumors arising in specific organs, reflecting onco-genomic and histopathological features of particular tumor types.  This project will use four mouse models to characterize newly implicated determinants of invasive tumor growth. We have observed that genetic polymorphisms can govern predisposition to invasive cancer.  Additionally, therapeutic targeting of another hallmark capability &#226;&#128;&#147; tumor angiogenesis &#226;&#128;&#147; has revealed adaptive resistance, whereby late-stage tumors, faced with the inability to grow en masse supported by angiogenesis, switch instead to grow diffusively, by invading adjacent tissue; this phenomenon may underlay the limited benefit seen with anti-angiogenic therapies in the clinic. There are three interconnected goals:
(1) Polymorphic regulation of tumor invasion. We will investigate the mechanisms and functional importance of candidate genes resident within a genetic modifier locus on mouse Chr 17 that can alternatively suppress or facilitate invasive tumor growth dependent on constitutional genetic background.
(2) Adaptive induction of invasion. We will elucidate the determinants of the invasive growth capability that is induced in response to potent inhibition of angiogenesis.
(3) Testing mechanism-based therapeutic co-targeting of the capabilities for invasion and angiogenesis.
We will use functional genetic, genomic profiling, and pharmacological approaches to assess these two new modes of regulating invasive growth, and then apply the knowledge in preclinical trials aiming to lay the groundwork for future clinical trials in which these intersecting hallmark capabilities are coordinately disrupted, with promise for more enduring therapeutic responses and benefit to cancer patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HippoKAR"><Rcn>110737</Rcn><Nid>10188</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Understanding the roles of kainate receptors in the hippocampus</Name><PI>Graham Leon Collingridge</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Kainate receptors (KARs) are often regarded as the last frontier of glutamate receptor research, since much less is known about their physiological roles compared with that of the other glutamate receptor subtypes. This field of research is very important not just because of the unique role that KARs play in neuronal function, including specific forms of synaptic plasticity, but because of the increasing evidence that KARs are involved in a plethora of brain diseases and that KAR antagonists are promising novel therapeutic targets. I propose to lead a highly multidisciplinary approach, in collaboration with colleagues at Bristol and strategic collaborators worldwide, to develop novel pharmacological and genetic tools, which will be rapidly disseminated to the neuroscience community. These tools will be used here to test hypotheses regarding functions of KARs in granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, with a focus on mossy fibre long-term potentiation (LTP).  We propose four interrelated objectives: (i) to develop potent and selective antagonists for the GluK2 subunit of KARs, (ii) to generate GC specific knockouts of the five KAR subunits, by floxing GluK1-5 and crossing with a GC-specific Cre recombinase mouse line, (iii) to use these and existing tools in a combined pharmacological and genetic approach, to understand the functions of KARs at mossy fibre synapses in acute and organotypic hippocampal slices. A new development will be to record simultaneously from synaptically coupled GC-CA3 neuronal pairs and to image Ca2+ from participating mossy fibre boutons, (iv) to extend these investigations to the study of mossy fibre function, in particular LTP, in anaesthetised animals and to establish the function of mossy fibre LTP in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.

The major nutrients available to these organisms are dietary glycans that are not metabolized by mammalian enzymes in the small intestines. Dietary and nutraceutical strategies can, potentially, be deployed to encourage the dominance of beneficial microbes in the microbiota (e.g. those producing health promoting SCFAs such as propionate and butyrate, and bacteria that have an anti-inflammatory impact through its interaction with the human immune system), ensuring that this microbial ecosystem has a positive influence on human health. This approach, however, is greatly restricted by a critical lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which complex glycans are metabolized by the microbiota. Significantly, the wealth of genomic and metagenomic microbiota sequence data now available, presents an exciting and unparalleled opportunity to make decisive advances in our understanding of glycan metabolism in the human large bowel. This project seeks to capitalize on this genomic information, in harness with recent functional data from my lab., to understand the mechanisms by which complex glycans are metabolized by the human microbiota. At a generic level, by providing insight into glycan resource allocation in the microbiota, this ERC advanced fellowship will make a significant contribution to protein evolutionary biology. The microbiota represents a highly concentrated reservoir of microbes that is continuously exposed to an extensive repertoire of diverse and highly complex glycans, the metabolism of which is essential for bacterial survival.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,014</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="HyLife"><Rcn>111248</Rcn><Nid>12560</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Exploiting hybrids between annual and perennial plant species to identify genes conferring agronomically important traits</Name><PI>George Michael Coupland</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Flowering plants exhibit a variety of different life cycles. This variation contributes in nature to adaptation to diverse environments and in agriculture to optimising crop yield. Annual monocarpic species flower once during their life, produce seeds and then undergo generalized senescence leading to death of the plant. By contrast polycarpic perennials survive seed production and live for many years flowering repeatedly. Most of our major crops are monocarpic annuals but perennials predominate in many ecological niches. Perennials exhibit phenotypic traits that would be advantageous for crops, such as an extended growing season, long duration of flowering and seed set as well as longer roots that more efficiently utilize nutrients and water supply. The high productivity of perennials explains their current use as sources of biomass. I propose here to use the progeny of hybrids between annual and perennial species in the Brassicaceae to isolate genes that confer key differences between these life histories. The utility of such genes in improving annual crops will then be tested. Arabis alpina and Arabis montbretiana are sister species that are respectively perennial and annual. We produced hybrids between these species and from them derived segregating populations by backcrossing. Here I propose to extensively genotype and phenotype these populations to identify genes promoting or suppressing senescence after flowering as well as those controlling the duration and extent of flowering. Orthologues of these genes will be identified in closely related Brassica species and alleles conferring perennial traits introduced into annual oil seed rape using genetic as well as transgenic strategies. Particularly those genes suppressing senescence and extending the duration of flowering will be tested for their effects on yield. This knowledge-based approach to introducing perennial traits into annual crops is expected to generate novel phenotypic variation that enhances yield.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,490,624</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="I-MIRNOME"><Rcn>99074</Rcn><Nid>12616</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Milano, Italy</HI><Name>Lymphocyte microRNAs in health and disease: Understanding lymphocyte functions through the identification of microRNA target genes and exploiting serum microRNA signatures to monitor immune responses</Name><PI>Sergio Abrignani</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Background: CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets orchestrate immune responses in health and disease. Little is known on control of T cell differentiation exerted by microRNA that affect mRNA translation. The identification of microRNA and their targets that regulate differentiation of T cell subsets may provide new therapeutic targets for immune-mediated diseases. Since microRNA are released in exosomes and circulate in blood, activities of tissue-derived lymphocytes could be assessed by microRNA signatures in the serum. We have defined microRNAs present in resting lymphocyte subsets from peripheral blood and measured lymphocyte-derived microRNAs in the serum. We have also solved important challenges for the identification of microRNA targets, the definition of signatures of activated T cells and their monitoring in the serum, which form the key topics of this application. Advancing State-of-the-Art and objectives: We will identify microRNA of CD4+ T cell subsets purified from inflamed organs and investigate microRNA target network that regulates T cell differentiation. We will exploit this knowledge to profile signatures of in vivo activated T cells and to map genes that could improve understanding of T cell commitment. We will also develop quantitative assays to monitor microRNA signatures in the serum and provide functional evidence of key genes targeted by microRNA which could be targets of immunomodulatory drugs.

Multiple pathways are involved in detection, signalling and execution of the required steps involved in organization of blood and lymphatic vessels during embryonic development. Similar mechanisms are utilized for overcoming changes in tissue requirements also in adult tissues and in pathological processes. The goal of this work is to reveal the dynamic forces that shape the blood vessels during angiogenesis. In particular, we would like to explore the impact of interstitial convective flow in dynamic imprinting of growth factor signalling, thereby regulating vascular patterning. Angiogenesis is explored here as an example for a possible general role for interstitial convection of growth factors in determination of the fine spatial patterning of tissue morphogenesis in vertebrates. To achieve this goal, we will develop multi-modality tools for imaging the regulation of vascular patterning. In vivo imaging will then be utilized for mapping vascular patterning in pathological and physiological angiogenesis including tumours, wound repair, the preovulatory ovarian follicle and foetal implantation sites. Whole body optical, CT, ultrasound and MRI will be applied for non-invasive imaging of deep organs. Microscopic morphometric and molecular information will be derived from the macroscopic imaging data, using selective molecular imaging approaches and functional imaging tools with specific pharmacological models that will be developed to account for interstitial convective flow. Intravital two photon microscopy and fluorescence endoscopy will be used for high resolution evaluation of vascular patterning.

The goal of the project is to develop Bayesian geostatistical methodology for very large, non-stationary data and employ it to  (i) determine the relative contribution of malaria, helminth infections and malnutrition on anaemia and severe anaemia burden among pre-school children; (ii) obtain spatially explicit estimates of the risk of anaemia, severe anaemia and number of affected children; (iii) characterize co-endemicity patterns of anaemia, malaria, helminth infection and malnutrition; and (iv) quantify the contribution of severe anaemia to child mortality.
This research will contribute novel statistical methodologies in (i) spatial analysis of very large non-stationary geostatistical data, (ii) variable selection within a non-stationary model for very large geostatistical data, (iii) modelling disease co-endemicity from spatially misaligned surveys arising from independent regression models and (iv) meta-analyses of heterogeneous large spatial data by coupling geostatistical with mathematical transmission models.
Applications of  geostatistical methodology will help optimising interventions to combat anaemia by generating (i) the first anaemia risk map and number of affected  preschool  children across Africa which will guide efficient allocation of nutrient supplements and fortified foods; (ii) anaemia  co-endemicity maps and estimates of the relative contribution of anaemia risk factors  to design integrated interventions based on local conditions; and (ii) estimates of the anaemia-related mortality across Africa."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IMMEMO"><Rcn>99660</Rcn><Nid>12532</Nid><HI>Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Protective and pathogenic immunological memory and its organisation by stroma cells</Name><PI>Andreas Radbruch</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Immunological memory provides immunity against recurrent pathogens, but also can induce and regulate immunopathology. In chronic immune-mediated diseases, a ""pathogenic"" immunological memory probably is the essential driver of inflammation, refractory to physiological regulation and state-of-the-art therapeutic immunosuppression, and thus a challenge for the development of novel, curative therapeutic strategies. Despite its relevance, immunological memory is poorly understood. We recently discovered memory plasma cells and professional memory T helper cells, and their organisation by bone marrow stroma and the stroma of inflamed tissues. We have identified genes and regulating function and persistence of memory and effector cells in the resting state and in chronic immune reactions. Based on these intriguing, paradigm-breaking initial results, I propose to develop and lead a research program addressing the organisation and role of immunological memory in protective immunity and in immune-mediated diseases, on the systemic, cellular and molecular level. In particular, I propose to (1) analyse the homing of plasmablasts and T helper memory cell precursors to dedicated survival niches of the bone marrow or inflamed tissues, (2) identify the niches of CD8 memory cells and memory B cells, (3) analyse the cellular and molecular composition of memory niches, (4) decipher the molecular communication between stromal cells and immune memory cells, (5) analyse how memory/effector T helper cells are reactivated, (6) define the role of memory-phenotype T  cells in the periphery, (7) analyse the role of twist1 and hop  for persistence and function of pathogenic Th memory/effector cells, and (8) develop strategies to selectively delete pathogenic immune memory cells."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,465,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IMMUDROSO"><Rcn>94114</Rcn><Nid>12489</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, France</HI><Name>"Sensing and Signalling in the Innate Immune Response, using Drosophila as a Model."</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Louis Charles Reichhart</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The project seeks to advance our knowledge of the innate immune system at two different but complementary levels, sensing and regulation of signalling. The first aim is centred on danger signals, and how they activate the immune system. We propose to use high-throughput RNA sequencing, molecular biology, fly and bacterial genetics to investigate the global network of genes and pathways that are involved in either endogenous (DNA and chromatin components) or exogenous (pathogen virulence factors) danger signal sensing. Drosophila is used here as a model system to analyse the complexities of host-pathogen interactions. As many bacteria use a common set of virulence factors to target different hosts, this work should lead to the identification of new defence genes and mechanisms in human. The second aim seeks to understand the mechanisms that fine-tune NF-&#194;&#186;B signalling in Drosophila and in mammals. NF-&#194;&#186;B mediates every aspect of inflammation and immune response through transcriptional programs that have to be orchestrated by yet unknown regulatory layers. The ability to effectively target inflammatory diseases for therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of the intricacies of these regulatory layers. First, we propose to characterize the molecular function of a new modulator of NF-&#194;&#186;B signalling that we have recently discovered, by using yeast two-hybrid screens, mass spectrometry and Drosophila genetics. In parallel, we propose to analyze the role of newly discovered and evolutionary conserved small RNAs in the regulation of the innate immune response in Drosophila.

Attempts are therefore being made to find ways to slow brain-aging processes; successful therapies would have a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals, and decrease healthcare expenditures. Aging of the immune system has never been suggested as a factor in memory loss.  My group formulated the concept of  protective autoimmunity , suggesting a linkage between immunity and self-maintenance in the context of the brain in health and disease. Recently, we showed that T lymphocytes recognizing brain-self antigens have a pivotal role in maintaining hippocampal plasticity, as manifested by reduced neurogenesis and impaired cognitive abilities in T-cell deficient mice. Taken together, our novel observations that T cell immunity contributes to hippocampal plasticity, and the fact that T cell immunity decreases with progressive aging  create the basis for the present proposal.  We will focus on the following questions: (a) Which aspects of cognition are supported by the immune system- learning, memory or both;  (b) whether aging of the immune system is sufficient to induce aging of the brain; (c) whether activation of the immune system is sufficient to reverse age-related cognitive decline; (d) the mechanism underlying the effect of peripheral immunity on brain cognition; and (e) potential therapeutic implications of our findings. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the immune system contributes to spatial memory, and that imposing an immune deficiency is sufficient to cause a reversible memory deficit. These findings give strong reason for optimism that memory loss in the elderly is preventable and perhaps reversible by immune-based therapies; we hope that, in the not too distant future, our studies will enable development of a vaccine  to prevent CNS aging and cognitive loss in elderly.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,650,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2012-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IMMUNEMESIS"><Rcn>110444</Rcn><Nid>12667</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>The Plant Immune System: Epistasis and Fitness-Tradeoffs</Name><PI>Detlef Weigel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"A fundamental question in biology is how multicellular organisms distinguish self and non-self. The requirement to specifically recognize only foreign cells and molecules constrains the diversification of the immune system, resulting in conflicts between effective detection of enemies, adaptive changes in the cellular machinery and mating with divergent genotypes from the same species. In plants, there is generally a trade-off between immunity and growth, and immune system activation is often associated with impaired development. There are many examples of autoimmunity in hybrids, caused by a gene product from one parent erroneously interpreting a gene product from the other parent as foreign. This is not surprising, given the extraordinary diversity of many immune genes. On the other hand, hybrid vigor, or heterosis, is commonly observed in F1 progeny from two inbred parents, and this is widely exploited in breeding. Thus, it is also of practical importance to understand how outcrossing affects the plant immune system. We hypothesize that overt hybrid autoimmunity represents only the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many more subtle non-additive genetic interactions that affect both the plant immune system and growth. We therefore propose a comprehensive research program to dissect epistatic interactions with effects on plant growth and health. Specifically, we will conduct genomics-enabled, systematic forward genetic studies with natural genotypes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and its outcrossing sister species A. lyrata. This will be complemented by experiments that will link diversity of microbial communities with that of the immune system in natural plant populations. The systematic understanding of forces that shape the distribution of immune gene alleles in the wild will have important implications for engineering disease resistance in crops, by helping to chose the best ensembles of resistance genes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,900</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IMMUNEXPLORE"><Rcn>95521</Rcn><Nid>8743</Nid><HI>Fondazione Per L&#226;&#128;&#153;Istituto Di Ricerca In Biomedicina, Switzerland</HI><Name>New approaches to analyze and exploit the human B and T cell response against viruses</Name><PI>Antonio Lanzavecchia</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Immunological memory confers long term protection against pathogens and is the basis of successful vaccination.
Following antigenic stimulation long lived plasma cells and memory B cells are maintained for a lifetime,
conferring immediate protection and enhanced responsiveness to the eliciting antigen. However, in the case of
variable pathogens such as influenza virus, B cell memory is only partially effective, depending on the extent of
similarity between the preceding and the new viruses. The B cell response is dominated by serotype-specific
antibodies and heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing several serotypes appear to be extremely rare.
Understanding the basis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses is a critical aspect for the development
of more effective vaccines. In this project we will explore the specificity and dynamics of human antibody
responses to influenza virus by using newly developed technological platforms to culture human B cells and plasma
cells and to analyze the repertoire of human na&#195;&#175;ve and memory T cells. High throughput functional screenings,
structural analysis and testing in animal models will provide a thorough characterization of the human immune
response. The B cell and T cell analysis aims at understanding fundamental aspects of the immune response such
as: the selection and diversification of memory B cells; the individual variability of the antibody response, the
mechanisms of T-B cooperation and the consequences of the original antigenic sin and of aging on the immune
response. This analysis will be complemented by a translational approach whereby broadly neutralizing human
monoclonal antibodies will be developed and used: i) for passive vaccination against highly variable viruses; ii) for
vaccine design through the identification and production of recombinant antigens to be used as effective vaccines;
and iii) for active vaccination in order to facilitate T cell priming and jump start the immune responses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,979,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IMMUNOBIOTA"><Rcn>185406</Rcn><Nid>10749</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Host-microbiota interactions across the gut immune system: lessons from early onset inflammatory bowel diseases and from gnotobiotic mice</Name><PI>Nadine Christine Cerf Spouse Bensussan</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"How the immune system controls the partnership established between mammalian hosts and the complex microbial community that colonizes their distal intestine is a fascinating topic with wide implications in physiology and pathology. In order to delineate how the two partners build and maintain mutualistic relationships, we intend to combine bench to bed-site approaches in humans and mechanistic studies in mice.

The first part of the proposal aims at dissecting human host pathways mandatory to maintain homeostatic relationships with the microbiota through the analysis of a cohort of young children with colites of early onset likely caused by Mendelian mutations. In this part, we expect to take advantage from recent development of powerful tools in genome analysis to extend our expertise in human intestinal immunopathology, provide novel basic insight into immuno-regulation in the human gut and delineate new tools and strategies for the diagnosis and care of inflammatory bowel diseases in children.

In the second part of the proposal, we intend to capitalise on our recent results highlighting the key role of Segmented Filamentous Bacterium in the post-natal maturation of the gut immune system in mice and on very recent evidence of a host-specific version of this bacterium in the human microbiota. First, we want to combine analyses in gnotobiotic mice and molecular approaches to provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms underlying the outstanding immunostimulatory functions of this unusual symbiont. We hope thereby to identify the bacterial attributes that drive the physiological activation of the host immune system and to gain insight into the rules that govern host-microbiota interactions.

Cell death is usually non-immunogenic, and only a small minority of chemotherapeutic agents can induce immunogenic cell death, which - in contrast to classical apoptosis - is preceded by two types of pre-mortem stress, autophagy (which is required for cellular ATP release, an obligatory signal of immunogenicity) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (which is required for calreticulin [CRT] exposure at the cell surface, another obligatory signal of immunogenicity). Here, we will explore the hypothesis that cancer cell death is only immunogenic if the two pathways of pre-mortem stress, autophagy and ER stress, are simultaneously activated. Thus, we aim at &#226;&#128;&#156;decoding&#226;&#128;&#157; the anticancer drug-induced cellular pathways that regulate the immunogenicity of cell death. For this, we will trigger cancer cell death preceded by one or the two types of pre-mortem stress in a &#226;&#128;&#156;synthetic system&#226;&#128;&#157; (by genetic manipulation involving inducible transgenes in cancer cells and mice) or by means of selected pharmacological compounds in multiple in vitro and in vivo cancer models, as we monitor the immune-dependent therapeutic response. Moreover, we will investigate the functional links between autophagy, ER stress and immunogenic signaling.

We will apply ion mobility mass spectrometry to extract collision cross sections of membrane complexes of known structure and compare these with those calculated form atomic coordinates.

Maladaptation in this host microbial dialogue leads to a deranged inflammatory response and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can progress to colon cancer. The complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors and their impact on intestinal inflammation are starting to be deciphered in IBD, however little is known about how they influence the transition from colitis to cancer. We recently established a relevant model of bacteria-driven invasive colon cancer and have mapped both genetic and immune pathways that perpetuate disease. Genetic susceptibility maps to a 1.7mb region on chromosome 3 containing the candidate gene Alpk1, an alpha-kinase. This locus mediates its effects through the IL-23 driven innate lymphoid cell response and we have identified the cytokine IL-22 as a key player in driving the tumour cell response. We will use a multi-disciplinary approach to probe the interaction between genetics, microbial drivers and inflammatory pathways that promote colon cancer. BAC transgenics and cell-type specific knock-out mice will be used to establish the function of Alpk1 in bacteria driven colon cancer.  In vivo models will be complemented by novel 3D colonic organoid and crypt cultures generated from epithelial stem cells from normal or tumor tissue allowing analysis of microbial and cytokine signals that influence intestinal epithelial cell and stem cell function. Deep sequencing combined with bacterial cell culture will identify changes in the intestinal microbiota that drive tumourigenesis.

They control the secretion of GLP-1, insulin and glucagon, and the activity of the autonomic nervous system. These hormonal and nervous signals coordinate glucose utilization by liver, fat and muscle, and endogenous glucose production as well as feeding and energy expenditure. Type 2 diabetes, a disease that afflicts an increasing proportion of the world population, is characterized by insufficient insulin production by pancreatic beta-cells, abnormal secretion of GLP-1 and glucagon, and is often associated with imbalance between feeding and energy expenditure. Type 2 diabetes can thus be considered a disease of glucose sensing. Here, I propose a research program using cell biological, genetic, genomic and physiology techniques to investigate three aspects of this integrated glucose sensing network:
1. The identification of novel molecular pathways activated by GLP-1 and that control adult beta-cell proliferation, glucose competence and apoptosis in order to maintain sufficient insulin secretion capacity.
2. The identification and molecular characterization of brain glucose sensors, which share functional similarities with pancreatic beta-cells, and which control glucose homeostasis and pancreatic islet mass and function.
3. The discovery by unbiased genetic-genomic analysis of loci, genes, and gene networks involved in central hypoglycemia detection and the secretion of glucagon, a process whose deregulation is a major limitation in insulin treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

This project is based on a constellation of pilot experiments that support its feasibility. It will capitalize on 15 novel lines of knockin mice that will allow us to generate via Mass Spectrometry  a high-density set of quantitative data describing the TCR signaling network of primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. INTEGRATE will also include innovative genetic approaches to analyze the T-cell intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that terminate T cell activation and the malfunctions of which are at the basis of inflammation and autoimmunity. Since the study of DCs is mandatory if we are ever to make sense of the complexity of T cell activation, a segment of the INTEGRATE project will be devoted to disentangle the function of key DC subsets in vivo. Four aims will be addressed using multidisciplinary approaches:
AIM 1: Defining via MS the composition and dynamics of the signaling complexes that assemble around 17 nodes of the TCR signaling cascade of primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and in regulatory T cells.
AIM 2: Determining how mutations that reduce TCR signaling output paradoxically lead to autoimmune pathologies.

The key hypotheses emerged from our experiments and propose that neurogliaform cells and axo-axonic cells achieve their function in the cortex through extreme forms of unspecificity and specificity, respectively. The project capitalizes on our discovery that neurogliaform cells reach GABAA and GABAB receptors on target cells through unitary volume transmission going beyond the classical theory which states that single cortical neurons act in or around synaptic junctions. We propose that the spatial unspecificity of neurotransmitter action leads to unprecedented functional capabilities for a single neuron simultaneously acting on neuronal, glial and vascular components of the surrounding area allowing neurogliaform cells to synchronize metabolic demand and supply in microcircuits. In contrast, axo-axonic cells represent extreme spatial specificity in the brain: terminals of axo-axonic cells exclusively target the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons. Axo-axonic cells were considered as the most potent inhibitory neurons of the cortex. However, our experiments suggested that axo-axonic cells can be the most powerful excitatory neurons known to date by triggering complex network events. Our unprecedented recordings in the human cortex show that axo-axonic cells are crucial in activating functional assemblies which were implicated in higher order cognitive representations. We aim to define interactions between active cortical networks and axo-axonic cell triggered assemblies with an emphasis on mechanisms modulated by neurogliaform cells and commonly prescribed drugs.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,391,695</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IPBSL"><Rcn>94586</Rcn><Nid>9653</Nid><HI>Instituto Nacional De Tecnica Aeroespacial Esteban Terradas, Spain</HI><Name>Science and technology development for in situ detection and cjharacterization of subsurface life on the Iberian Pyritic Belt</Name><PI>Ricardo Amils Pibernat</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Terrestrial subsurface geomicrobiology is a matter of growing interest on many level. From a fundamental point of view, it seeks to determine wheter life can be sustained in the absence of radiation. From an astrobiological point of view, it is an interesting model for early life on Earth, as well as a representation of life as it could occur in other planetary bodies. R&#195;&#173;o Tinto is an unusual extreme acidic environment, it rises in the core of the Iberian Pyritic Belt (IPB), one of the biggest sulfidic ore deposits in the world. Today it is clear that the extreme characteristics of R&#195;&#179; Tinto are not due to mining activity, but to the chemolithotrophic microorganisms thriving in the high concentration of metal sulfides of the IPB. To explore the hypothesis that a continuous underground reactor of chemolithotrophic microorganisms thriving in the rich sulfidic minerals of the IPB is responsible for the extreme conditions found in the river, we propose a drilling project to detect the subsurface microbial activity, the potential resources to support these microbial communities, and to follow the in situ geomicrobiological evolution in real time. In this project, we propose to explore the R&#195;&#173;o Tinto at deep-basement regions (200-1000 m) by means of new approaches comprising: i) detection of life and estimation of the microbial diversity at the drilling sites providing an instant picture of the subsurface habitat, and ii) real time monitoring, inside the borehole, of physico-chemical parameters and biological activity generating essential information to recognize matter and energy fluxes. All these procesess are associated to long-term changes in the underground habitats and are not fully understood based on seasonal discontinuous subsurface analysis. To achieve these goals we will analize cores and fluids in the field site using new and poweful tools."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,246,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IRLVGTMND"><Rcn>89779</Rcn><Nid>13112</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>IMPROVED RETROGRADE LENTIVIRAL VECTORS FOR GENE THERAPY IN MOTOR NEURON DISEASES</Name><PI>Nicholas Mazarakis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Lentiviral vectors can be targeted to specific cell types by varying the envelope proteins, a process called pseudotyping. The rabies-G pseudotyped lentivectors are useful for distal targeting of neurons because they are retrogradely transported to the nucleus where they integrate and express the transgene, as first demonstrated by us. Motor neuron (MN) diseases are incurable neurodegenerative diseases causing progressive paralysis and premature death. Most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases are sporadic, but there are rare inherited forms one of which being due to mutations in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the second commonest genetic disease affecting children and is due to mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. In mouse models for ALS (SOD1 mutant mouse) or SMA (SMNDelta7 mouse) when we delivered in various muscle groups rabies-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors expressing either vascular endothelial growth factor or short interfering RNA targeted to a mutated SOD1 gene or the normal SMN1 gene we corrected motor defects and extended survival. Despite these successes, experiments with rabies-G pseudotyped vectors in non-human primates have failed to give good efficiency of transduction of MNs so as to translate this approach to the clinic. Also SMN-1 targeted replacement produced only a marginal increase in survival despite sparing MNs. In this grant we propose: 1) To investigate the molecular pathway of retrograde transport of the rabies-G lentiviral vectors.  This might allow us to increase the efficacy of gene transfer with these vector systems. 2) To design novel lentiviral vectors with tropism to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) so as to try to increase the efficiency/specificity of gene transfer to MNs. 3) To utilise the new NMJ-targeted lentiviral vector derived in (2) to simultaneously deliver several neuroprotective proteins to MNs and test its efficacy in animal models of ALS and SMA.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ISIS"><Rcn>107221</Rcn><Nid>9623</Nid><HI>Universitaet Regensburg, Germany</HI><Name>Identification and targeting of somatic changes initiating sporadic cancers</Name><PI>Christoph Klein</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Cancer drugs are extremely ineffective, generally because current therapies do not address cellular heterogeneity. While hypothesis-driven research and functional genomics identify ever more novel putative therapeutic targets, the scientific community lacks rationales to attack the cellular heterogeneity in cancer, to select among the targets the most promising, and to design combination therapies. In particular, these all fail to provide successful adjuvant therapy settings after curative resection of the primary tumour before the onset of manifest metastasis.
Here I propose a novel way to address cancer cell heterogeneity and to develop a rationale for the design of adjuvant therapies. The proposal rests upon the premises that (i) cancer initiation is causally associated with genetic changes, (ii) early, functionally relevant genetic changes -particularly involving DNA loss- have the highest probability to be shared among the progeny of a monoclonal, yet genetically unstable, cancer, and (iii) subsequent, cumulative genetic changes must either add to the fitness of the cell or at least be neutral to enable progression. The proposal is then built upon our observation that a subgroup of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) displays normal karyotypes and DNA changes smaller than 10 Mb whilst primary tumours and more advanced DCCs harbour multiple additional chromosomal changes at the time of analysis. I suggest that although these karyotypically normal DCCs are the putative &#226;&#128;&#156;loser cells&#226;&#128;&#157; in cancer progression - since they are arrested in bone marrow - they are central to uncovering the early genetic changes of an individual cancer. With these cells we will identify for the first time the catalogue of initiating changes of sporadic cancers in a systematic way. We will then test the function of the early aberrations and perform functional viability screens to develop novel systemic therapies that target the Achilles&#226;&#128;&#153; heel of a given cancer: its shared critical alteration.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,982</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ImageLink"><Rcn>108354</Rcn><Nid>9436</Nid><HI>Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Germany</HI><Name>Multiparametric tumor imaging and beyond: Towards understanding in vivo signals</Name><PI>Bernd J&#195;&#188;rgen Pichler</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Non-invasive preclinical and clinical imaging is a powerful tool and has a huge potential, specifically in the realm of oncology. Recently, our laboratory developed a novel multimodality imaging system, which combines positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yielding temporally and spatially matched data. However, the molecular PET and functional MRI signals are very complex and are often not fully understood. Thus, we will cross-validate the complementary PET/MRI information with proteomics and metabolomics data to gain a better understanding of the in vivo image data and yield finally an accurate holistic tumor profile. The cross-validation will be supported by image-guided accurately dissected tumor substructures. Tumor metabolism, receptor status, hypoxia, perfusion, apoptosis and angiogenesis will be investigated by established PET tracers. In the same imaging session, functional parameters of the tumor, such as perfusion, oxygenation and morphology will be assessed by MRI. Beyond this, novel imaging ligands for senescence, tumor stroma, and fatty acid synthase, which have been recently recognized as emerging key-players in tumor progression and therapy resistance, will be developed. The individual in vivo and in vitro parameters will be fed into a data mining utilizing a computer learning approach with regression and classification methods to detect common patterns and the related pharmacokinetics behind the in vivo imaging parameters. Analysis of the dynamic PET data will be performed by compartment analysis and kinetic modelling. Overall aim is to gain a better understanding of imaging data, provide an accurate holistic in vivo tumor profile to support prognostic parameters for tumor progression and therapy response. Finally, the revealed information will lead to a more accurate selection of imaging biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy control and will provide input for new strategies in tumor-specific tracer development.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Imaging-inthe-Magnet"><Rcn>111264</Rcn><Nid>10111</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Bridging the gap between cellular imaging and fMRI BOLD imaging</Name><PI>Serge Charpak</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>In the brain, blood flow increases locally upon neuronal activation, a response named functional hyperemia. The extent to which functional hyperemia faithfully reports brain activation, spatially or temporally, remains a matter of debate. Solving this question is important, not only because functional hyperemia supplies energy and clears metabolites from activated brain regions, but also because it is used as a proxy to measure brain activation in humans. In particular, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is now commonly used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), strongly depends on functional hyperemia.
Using a combination of standard two-photon imaging and a new one-photon optical development allowing cellular resolution imaging within a fMRI magnet, I will investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling and oxygen consumption in the rodent olfactory bulb glomerulus. I will analyze the extent to which these cellular mechanisms are correlated to the BOLD signal, simultaneously acquired during sensory stimulation. The project will focus on the following issues:
A. Functional hyperemia: role of neurons and astrocytes
How does functional hyperemia depend on neurons and astrocytes during sensory stimulation? How does it differ in anesthetized and awake animals?
B. Oxygen consumption during response to odor
How does the brain&#226;&#128;&#153;s oxygen partial pressure match neuronal activation and functional hyperemia? How does it differ in anesthetized and awake animals?

This hypothesis implies that CSCs must be eliminated to achieve cancer cure. Nevertheless, direct proof is still lacking, and recent findings challenge our concepts of CSCs, showing the limits of the CSC-defining assay (transplantation) and suggesting that CSC-identity might be context-dependent. We found two properties of CSCs self-renewal that are indispensable for the maintenance of an expanding CSC-pool and tumour growth: increased frequency of symmetric divisions, due to inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor, and increased replicative potential, due to up-regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21. We will now investigate: i) How loss of p53 in tumours leads to expansion of the CSC pool, by testing the hypothesis that p53-loss activates the Myc oncogene which induces CSC-reprogramming of differentiated cancer cells. ii) Whether p53-independent pathways are also implicated, by in vivo shRNA screens of primary tumours or normal progenitors to identify pathways involved, respectively, in CSC self-renewal or inhibition of SC-reprogramming. iii) How p21-induced cell-cycle arrest protects CSCs from self-renewal exhaustion, by investigating regulation of cell-cycle recruitment of quiescent CSCs. iv) Whether activation of p21 in CSCs induces a mutator phenotype, due to its ability to activate DNA repair, by investigating mechanisms of DNA-damage, mutation rates, and relevance of CSC mutations for development of chemoresistance. We will test self-renewal functions in a transplantation-independent assay, based on tumour re-growth in vivo after cytotoxic treatments and &#226;&#128;&#156;clonal tracking&#226;&#128;&#157; of re-growing tumours (using barcoded lentiviral libraries).

The neocortex is a particularly relevant region for plasticity because it is involved in sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks with strong learning components. However, despite many years of intensive research our knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms of plasticity on the level of single synapses in the intact living brain is still very limited.
Here I propose the use of cutting edge technology, including the ultrasensitive LOTOS procedure of in vivo two-photon calcium imaging that was developed in our laboratory, to investigate for the first time the functional properties and the plasticity of signal synapses in auditory cortical pyramidal neurons of layers 2/3, 4 and 5 in vivo. For the study of the cellular determinants of synaptic plasticity we will focus on an associative learning paradigm underlying cued fear conditioning. Importantly, this paradigm can be rapidly and effectively induced not only in awake, but also in anesthetized animals and is therefore ideally suited for these studies. In addition to a comprehensive analysis of wild type animals, we will perform experiments in mouse models of Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease (AD), aiming to identify the cellular cause of the devastating impairment of memory formation observed in patients suffering from AD.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,404,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="IndivuHeart"><Rcn>188503</Rcn><Nid>12232</Nid><HI>Universitaetsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany</HI><Name>Individualized early risk assessment for heart diseases</Name><PI>Thomas Hans Eschenhagen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Heart failure (HF) is the common end-stage of different medical conditions. It is the only growing cardiovascular disease and its prognosis remains worse than that of many malignancies. The lack of evidence-based treatment for patients with diastolic HF (HFpEF) exemplifies that the current &#226;&#128;&#156;one for all&#226;&#128;&#157; therapy has to be advanced by an individualized approach. Inherited cardiomyopathies can serve as paradigmatic examples of different HF pathogenesis. Both gain- and loss-of-function mutations of the same gene cause disease, calling for disease-specific agonism or antagonism of this gene&#194;&#180;s function. However, mutations alone do not predict the severity of cardiomyopathies nor therapy, because their impact on cardiac myocyte function is modified by numerous factors, including the genetic context. Today, patient-specific cardiac myocytes can be evaluated by the induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology. Yet, unfolding the true potential of this technology requires robust, quantitative, high content assays. Our recently developed method to generate 3D-engineered heart tissue (EHT) from hiPSC provide an automated, high content analysis of heart muscle function and the response to stressors in the dish. The aim of this project is to make the technology a clinically applicable test. Major steps are (i) in depths clinical phenotyping and genotyping of patients with cardiomyopathies or HFpEF, (ii) follow-up of the clinical course, (iii) generation of hiPSC lines (40 patients, 40 healthy controls), and (iv) quantitative assessment of hiPSC-EHT function under basal conditions and in response to pro-arrhythmic or cardio-active drugs and chronic afterload enhancement. The product of this study is an SOP-based assay with standard values for hiPSC-EHT function/stress responses from healthy volunteers and patients with different heart diseases. The project could change clinical practice and be a step towards individualized risk prediction and therapy of HF.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,728</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="InterPlasticity"><Rcn>90230</Rcn><Nid>12299</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Long-term synaptic plasticity in interneurons: mechanisms and computational significance</Name><PI>Dimitri Michael Kullmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Memory encoding occurs by strengthening or weakening of synapses among principal neurons. However, excitatory synapses on some inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus also exhibit use-dependent long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), with important consequences for network homeostasis and information processing. This proposal addresses the following areas: 1. Although the rules determining which forms of plasticity occur at which synapses are emerging in the hippocampus, relatively little is known in other parts of the brain involved in cognition, movement initiation and emotion. We will use electrophysiology, optical imaging and mouse genetics to map out the expression of activity-dependent plasticity at excitatory synapses on inhibitory neurons in the cortex, striatum and amygdala, and relate these to the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the neurons and synapses involved. 2. Although one form of interneuron LTP resembles plasticity in pyramidal neurons, another form requires Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors for its induction, and shows features suggestive of pre-synaptic expression. A similar dichotomy exists in two forms of LTD, which depend on either NMDA or Ca2+-permeable AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors. We will test the involvement of candidate intracellular and trans-synaptic signalling cascades to understand the mechanisms triggered by distinct conjunction patterns of pre- and post-synaptic activity. 3. What is the computational significance of LTP and LTD in interneurons? The elemental computational roles of different GABAergic interneurons and their firing patterns during behaviourally relevant brain states are beginning to emerge. How synaptic strengthening and/or weakening interact with these network functions is however poorly understood. We will address this through a combination of hypothesis-driven experiments and numerical simulations.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="KATP-DIABETES"><Rcn>109230</Rcn><Nid>12714</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>ATP-sensitive potassium channels: from atomic structure to human disease</Name><PI>Frances Mary Ashcroft</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>We are currently experiencing a fast-growing diabetes pandemic. Both type 2 diabetes and rare monogenic forms of diabetes, such as neonatal diabetes, are characterised by impaired insulin secretion. This project seeks to resolve the fundamental mechanisms underlying insulin secretion and its failure in diabetes. We have shown that activating mutations in the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel cause neonatal diabetes, which has enabled children with this disease to switch from insulin injections to oral sulphonylurea drugs (which block their open KATP channels and stimulate insulin release). The most severe mutations also cause neurological symptoms that, for unknown reasons, are less well treated by sulphonylureas. We aim to: obtain a detailed mechanistic understanding of how nucleotides and drugs regulate KATP channel activity by combining state-of-the-art structural and functional approaches; define how drug therapy affects glucose homeostasis in neonatal diabetes; and explore how activating KATP channel mutations affect glucagon release from pancreatic alpha-cells. We will also investigate how severe KATP channel mutations cause neurological symptoms (such as developmental delay, reduced sensitivity to general anaesthetics and impaired eye movements) and determine how these might be alleviated by drug therapy. While underpinned by my previous work, this project takes my research in new directions, including structural analysis of eukaryotic membrane proteins, stimulus-secretion coupling in other types of islet cell, and neurological studies in humans as well as animal models. It involves a broad multidisciplinary approach, addresses questions of fundamental scientific importance, and has a strong translational element.

This process takes place at kinetochores, complex scaffolds containing ~100 different proteins. Conceptually, kinetochores can be viewed as performing four distinct but highly integrated functions: 1) they bind centromeric chromatin at a specialized protein-DNA interface; 2) they build a dynamic microtubule-binding interface that is tightly linked to the centromere-binding interface; 3) they correct erroneous microtubule attachments; 4) they synchronize the progression of the cell cycle oscillator with the progression of the microtubule-kinetochore attachment process. In mammals, all four functions are essential, and their abrogation has untenable consequences for normal cell life. Conversely, their partial impairment has been implicated in chromosome instability and in the development of cancer and an array of genetic diseases. Our goal is to be able to map the kinetochore functions schematized above to the as yet largely uncharacterized architecture of the kinetochore and to unravel the elements of feedback control that allow their integration. By using a combination of structural and functional methods, we have made several recent important contributions to the field of kinetochore biology. In this application, we propose to take our efforts to a new level of complexity that will allow us to gain an integrated view of how kinetochores bind microtubules, how they correct improper attachment, and how they coordinate microtubule attachment with cell cycle progression. Our approach rests on strong experience in biochemical reconstitution and structural analysis, and is complemented by the introduction of methods to assess and model the dynamic responses of kinetochores to their variable environment.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="KRABnKAP"><Rcn>98546</Rcn><Nid>9878</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>KRAB/KAP1-mediated gene regulation in mammalian physiology and human diseases</Name><PI>Didier Trono</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims at exploring the roles or KRAB/KAP1-mediated gene regulation in mammalian physiology and the possible impact of its dysfunctions on human health. The proper control of gene expression is paramount to all biological events, and is orchestrated through a sophisticated balance of activating and repressing influences. The mouse and human genomes contain around four hundred genes encoding KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs), a family of tetrapod-restricted sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional repressors. Even though these KRAB-ZFPs represent the single largest group of transcriptional regulators encoded by higher vertebrates, their functions remain largely unknown. Nevertheless, it has been established that they share an essential cofactor, the histone methyltransferase- and histone deacetylase-recruiting KAP1, and act by triggering the formation of heterochromatin. KAP1 is ubiquitous, and KRAB-ZFPs are present in most if not all cells, albeit along distinctly cell type-, stage- and state-specific patterns, suggesting that KRAB/KAP1 gene regulation influences a very large number of physiological events. A few years ago, we launched a program aimed at addressing this hypothesis through a combination of genetic, functional and molecular studies focused on two paradigmatic organs, the lympho-hematopoietic system and the liver. Our preliminary results confirm that KRAB/KAP1-mediated transcriptional control is a master regulator of mammalian homeostasis. Accordingly, we now propose to dissect the regulatory networks orchestrated by KAP1 and KRAB-ZFPs in these two systems, to identify their gene targets and the mechanisms of their control, and to probe their possible implication in human pathologies targeting these organs.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,996</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LEED"><Rcn>94185</Rcn><Nid>11668</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics in theory, in the lab and in the field</Name><PI>Timothy Neal Coulson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Population biologists do not have a well-developed quantitative framework that links ecological and evolutionary dynamics in variable environments. Recent advances in stochastic demography and evolutionary biology mean that the formulation of a general quantitative framework is now within reach. The objective of this proposal is to develop this framework and to apply it to a laboratory and a field system. The key to linking evolutionary and population dynamics in variable environments is to understand what processes drive the dynamics of heritable phenotypic traits. I have developed methods to exactly decompose observed phenotypic change in structured populations living in variable environments. I will build on this research to develop predictive theory. The work will help unify ecology and evolutionary biology, and allow biologists to make predictions on the consequences of environmental change for the natural world. Theory can be used to explain observed change or make testable predictions. The theory I will develop will be applied to two systems bulb mites in the laboratory and wood mice in the field. Application to the bulb mite system will provide general insight into processes that maintain phenotypic and genetic diversity in stochastic, density-dependent environments, and will specifically explain why a heritable morphological character is maintained in bulb mites. In applying the theory to an established rodent field study I will utilise new, powerful technology that will allow researchers to monitor free-living animals in unprecedented detail.

We will make detailed measurements of musculoskeletal anatomy and muscle physiology to determine tradeoffs between power and economy for each group and the extent to which hunt performance and outcome can be simply attributed to musculoskeletal physiology and fatigue in the different species.

The technological innovation and integration, its application to wild animals and the massive potential for its application in field biology is all ground breaking. This would be the first investigation of hunting dynamics where every hunt, day and night of a predator is captured and analysed along with prey dynamics (in a subset) to understand what environmental factors influence outcome. It will be the first study to evaluate the extreme dynamics of highly motivated non-domestic species, their anatomy and muscle physiology and the locomotor determinants of successful and unsuccessful hunts. These data and the detailed tracking data will enable studies of terrain utilisation, intra- and inter-species conflict and the impact of vegetation change on species success and survival."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,079,643</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LSD1"><Rcn>107246</Rcn><Nid>9569</Nid><HI>Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Germany</HI><Name>The lysine-specific demethylase1 (LSD1) in physiology and pathology</Name><PI>Roland Schuele</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The identification of the first histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) established not only the concept of reversible histone methylation in epigenetic regulation but also translated this fundamentally novel biological observation into understanding the molecular mechanisms regulation stemness, differentiation, proliferation, and pathological growth. To unravel in an unbiased and comprehensive manner the biological function of LSD1 in physiology and pathology, we developed LSD1-deficient and LSD1-transgenic mouse models. LSD1-transgenic animals develop prostate tumours demonstrating that increased expression of LSD1 suffices for oncogenic growth in vivo. In addition, LSD1-transgenic animals exhibit a metabolic shift towards overt obesity in adulthood. LSD1-deficiency causes early embryonic lethality around day 7.5 of development. However, deletion of LSD1 is not essential for the development of the embryo proper until the onset of gastrulation, suggesting that the early embryonic lethality is caused by trophoblast defects. Indeed, our data demonstrate that LSD1 is crucial for maintaining trophoblast stem cells in their niche and required for the specification of trophoblast stem cell fate during initial steps of differentiation. To identify the underlying mechanisms that allow LSD1 to control a wide range of biological systems such as trophoblast stem cell fate in the early embryo, obesity, and prostate tumourigenesis in the adult, we propose to a) identify LSD1-associated protein complexes and b) LSD1 target genes establishing these phenotypes in the mouse.

Despite this pivotal role, little is known regarding migration paths and the molecular cues regulating homing of immune cells that arrive via afferent lymphatic vessels to LN. This conspicuous lack of knowledge is primarily due to profound technical limitations. My team and I have recently developed a highly innovative technique of micromanipulator-guided injections into afferent lymph vessels that drain into the popliteal LN of living mice allowing precise delivery of very low numbers of cells into a LN. This approach, in combination with multicolor 2-photon in vivo microscopy, will now allow new and ground-breaking insights in routes, cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate entry of cells reaching LNs via afferent lymphatics. Specifically, we aim to 1) characterize the homing potential of lymph-derived na&#195;&#175;ve B cells, na&#195;&#175;ve CD8 T cells, and regulatory T cells and study their contribution to LN homeostasis; 2) initiate and quantify primary immune responses to model antigens as well as pathogens mediated by na&#195;&#175;ve T cells that homed to LN via afferent lymphatics; 3) characterize memory immune responses mediated by different subpopulations of effector/memory cells that homed to LN via afferent lymphatics; 4) study the role of neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes in adaptive immune responses; 5) identify homing molecules and mechanisms that allow DCs and metastasizing tumor cells to penetrate the floor of the LN subcapsular sinus.
Results obtained from these studies will provide fundamentally new insights in processes that regulate immune cell homing to LN and the induction of primary and recall memory immune responses.

Their high incidence is due to special features of normal B cell development that promote chromosomal translocations and other genetic alterations. Another contributing factor is Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV), a B cell-transforming virus endemic in humans. EBV-infected cells are usually eliminated by the immune system, but in immunosuppressed (post-transplant or AIDS) patients, EBV infection spreads and drives lymphomagenesis.
We have generated a novel genetic tool that allows us to introduce combinations of loss- and gain-of-function mutations specifically into B cells in the mouse, to analyze the cooperation of oncogenic factors thought to contribute to B lymphomagenesis in humans. The unique feature of this method is that only a small fraction of cells is mutated (mimicking the sporadic nature of somatic cancerogenesis) and that cells having acquired either single or combined mutations can be observed side-by-side.
Using a large set of mutant alleles, we will test whether the interplay of certain combinations of survival, proliferation and differentiation signals determines the development of different classes of human B cell malignancies. A special focus is on Hodgkin&#194;&#191;s disease, where EBV infection and genetic reprogramming play a critical role. We will also investigate the mechanism of immune surveillance of EBV-infected B cells and EBV-driven B cell lymphomas.
Ultimately we hope to elucidate key pathways of lymphoma pathogenesis, identify novel contributing mutations, and generate preclinical mouse models to assess therapeutic strategies and mechanisms of tumor immune surveillance.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,487,787</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LYSOSOME"><Rcn>192384</Rcn><Nid>13464</Nid><HI>Kraeftens Bekaempelse, Denmark</HI><Name>Lysosomes as targets for cancer therapy</Name><PI>Marja Helena J&#195;&#164;&#195;&#164;ttel&#195;&#164;</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Knowing that the lysosomes contain a powerful cocktail of hydrolases capable of digesting cells and entire tissues, it is obvious that the maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity is of utmost importance for all cells, and especially for cancer cells with dramatically increased lysosomal activity. Yet, the mechanisms that regulate lysosomal membrane stability have remained obscure, largely due to the lack of methods sensitive enough to detect partial lysosomal leakage and suitable for screening purposes. We have finally succeeded in developing such a method, which allows me to propose here a project whose major aim is to reveal how cells maintain the integrity of lysosomal membranes. Based on our emerging data that firmly connect heat shock protein 70 and sphingolipid metabolism to lysosomal membrane stability, we will devote a large part of the project to the molecular details of these connections and to the characterization of the effects of new and already approved (cationic amphiphilic drugs) sphingolipid-regulating drugs on lysosomal membrane stability and cell survival. Additionally, we will screen selected siRNA libraries to identify signaling networks and lysosome-associated proteins essential for lysosomal membrane integrity, and small molecule libraries to identify compounds that induce lysosomal cell death. The next step is to identify lysosome-stabilizing mechanisms that are especially important for cancer cell survival. And the ultimate goal is to validate corresponding drug targets and drugs (old and new) for the induction of lysosomal cell death in therapy resistant cancers.

We found that tumors also induce lymphangiogenesis in draining LNs, leading to increased cancer spread to distal LNs and beyond. Very recently, we found that lymphatic vessel activation in peripheral tissues and draining LNs also plays a previously unanticipated role in the control of chronic inflammatory diseases. This proposal aims at a comprehensive characterization of the function of lymphatic vessels in inflammation, using a variety of genetic mouse models for enhanced or reduced lymphatic function, novel quantitative techniques for the in vivo imaging of lymphatic function, and a miniaturized 3-dimensional in vitro platform for the high-throughput phenotypic screening of libraries of small, drug-like molecules for modulators of lymphatic function. A genome-wide analysis of the gene expression profile shall be made from lymphatic vessels isolated by high-speed cell sorting and by immuno-laser capture microdissection from tumors and their lymph node metastases, inflamed tissue and its draining lymph nodes, and normal tissues, followed by functional characterization of potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Finally, we will establish novel genetically fluorescent mouse models for the in vivo real-time imaging of lymphatic activation, and we will develop an innovative approach for the in vivo detection of early micrometastases, using antibody-based PET and near-infrared imaging of tumor-induced stromal changes.

This signaling pathway involves lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acting via presynaptic LPA2 receptors. This is in turn controlled by a molecule which we named plasticity related gene-1 (PRG-1, Br&#195;&#164;uer et al., Nat Neurosci 2003) from the postsynaptic side (Trimbuch et al., Cell 2009). PRG-1 is a brain-specific membrane protein related to lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) with a selective expression in neurons (Geist et al., CMLS 2011). We detected an important role of LPA-synthesizing pathways in bioactive signaling at the synapse acting via ATX and etablished nano-particles as LPA-biosensor using the characteristic spectral shift allowing detection in 2-photon imaging. We provide insights into the oligomeric assembly of PRG-1 in the membrane and assessed LPA-binding, uptake and intracellular interaction partners of the molecule. Animals lacking one PRG-1 allele exhibit a broad spectrum of behavioral pathology indicative of altered brain network function and psychiatric disorders. These changes are already present in animals lacking only 50% of PRG-1. A point mutation at R345T which appears to result in loss-of-function when re-expressed in the mouse was found in 5925 healthy individuals with a heterozygous frequency of approximately 0.86% (about 4.500.000 European citizens). Individuals carrying this loss-of-function mutation revealed functional alterations of sensory gating involved in psychiatric disorders. We plan to continue our studies on (1) synthesis and action of LPA, (2) molecular function of PRG-1 in bioactive lipid signaling, and (3) the role of PRG-1 signaling in brain network function and psychiatric disorders. Characterization of the molecular basis of this novel modulatory signaling pathway and its role in brain network function will be important for our understanding of its role in health and disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,390</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Life-his-T"><Rcn>98547</Rcn><Nid>9326</Nid><HI>Stichting Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut-Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis, Netherlands</HI><Name>Mapping the life histories of T cells</Name><PI>Antonius Nicolaas Maria Schumacher</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>T cells display many different phenotypes and functions, depending on the nature of previously encountered signals.

Within this project we will utilize genetic reporter systems to determine:
1. How T cell recruitment, proliferation and death shape antigen-specific T cell responses
2. At which stage the resulting T cells commit to the effector or the memory T cell lineage
3. The self renewal potential of the tissue-resident memory T cells that remain after infection is cleared

The first aim is to re-route the biosynthetic pathways for these compounds into the chloroplast and to boost compound formation by optimizing and channeling reducing power from photosystem I into to the energy demanding steps. By these measures we aim to overcome the inherent limitations in plants to channel photosynthetic fixed carbon and reducing power directly into production of desired bioactive natural products. Our production targets are diterpenoids with the anti-cancer drug ingenol-3-angelate and the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin as the two chosen test compounds. Formation of the complicated hydroxylated core structures of these compounds is catalyzed by diterpenoid synthases and cytochrome P450s. These will be identified and expressed in the chloroplast. The ultimate aim is to construct a single supramolecular enzyme complex effectively using solar energy to produce complex diterpenoids. This will be accomplished by tethering the terpenoid synthases and the key P450 enzymes directly to the photosystem I complex using some of the small membrane spanning subunits of photosystem I as membrane anchors. The experimental systems used will initially be transient expression in tobacco and then move to stably transformed moss (Physcomitrella patens). The production system is built on the &#226;&#128;&#156;share your parts&#226;&#128;&#157; principle of synthetic biology and the aim is to construct a modular &#226;&#128;&#152;tool box&#226;&#128;&#153; as template for tailoring the synthesis of a whole range of valuable bioactive diterpenoids. Typically, these are difficult to obtain because they are produced in very low amounts in plants difficult to cultivate. The proposal opens up entirely new research horizons and removes current bottlenecks in industrial exploitation.

The wasting occurs during late stages of many unrelated chronic diseases and frequently leads to the death of affected individuals. Cachexia is most common in cancer, where an estimated 25% of patients die from cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) rather than from the cancer. Despite the tremendous impact of CAC on morbidity and mortality, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.

Recently, we demonstrated that lipase-catalyzed triacylglycerol (TG) catabolism is required for the pathogenesis of CAC. Mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme for TG hydrolysis (lipolysis), were completely protected from loss of both adipose tissue and muscle in two forms of cancer. This implies an essential role of the lipolytic process in the pathogenesis of CAC. Here we propose to elucidate the causal role of lipases and their coregulators in CAC development. We will determine mechanisms involved and pursue novel treatment strategies.

Our objectives are to:
- Investigate how different cancers in mice regulate tissue-specific lipolysis;
- Elucidate the functional role of lipases and their coregulators in the pathogenesis of CAC;
- Assess whether pharmacological inhibition of specific lipases prevents or delays CAC;
- Study the effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control.

The project enters a largely unexplored field: the role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of CAC. The work will heavily rely on the characterization of induced mutant mouse models with CAC and require extensive collaboration with experts in pathology and large-scale systems analytics. The results are expected to yield new mechanisms of disease development and provide novel therapeutic targets to prevent the devastating and prevalent consequences of CAC.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,446</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Liver IVM and HBV"><Rcn>94946</Rcn><Nid>12940</Nid><HI>Ospedale San Raffaele Srl, Italy</HI><Name>Imaging liver immunopathology by intravital microscopy (IVM): a new approach to study the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection</Name><PI>Luca Guidotti</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Overall objective and Specific Aims.

Cirrhosis prevalence in the EU is 0.5%-1%. However, development of therapies that prevent progression to cirrhosis is hampered by the lack of a sensitive, non-invasive method to quantify fibrosis or fibrosis progression (fibrogenesis). Liver biopsy 1) is risky, 2) shows high sampling variability, and 3) is too insensitive to assess fibrosis progression in clinical studies. Conventional radiological imaging, serum markers, and ultrasound- or MR-elastography do neither permit exact fibrosis nor any fibrogenesis measurement.
We plan to develop a clinically applicable methodology to quantitate fibrosis and fibrogenesis over the whole liver using imaging agents that target and thus quantify abundant fibrillar collagen or key cells that drive fibrogenesis (activated myofibroblasts and cholangiocytes). We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach using radiolabeled conjugates of high affinity that target integrin alphaVbeta6 and PDGFbeta receptor that are cell surface molecules of activated cholangiocytes and myofibroblasts. i.v. injection of the integrin conjugate allowed quantitative imaging of alphaVbeta6 expression and correlated with whole liver fibrogenesis. We intend to optimize nonpeptide and peptide ligands for integrin alphaVbeta6, PDGF beta receptor and fibrillar collagens using novel linkers and oligomerization, using PET-radioimaging with Ga-68, Sc-44 and F-18. The targeted imaging constructs will be validated in vivo using established rodent models with defined liver fibrosis and fibrogenesis, with and without antifibrotic drug therapy. Translation to phase I and II clinical studies is planned in years 4-5 of the project.
The technology will for the first time allow for 1. individual risk assessment of fibrosis progression, and 2. rapid testing of antifibrotic drugs and their combinations in small groups of individual patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,454,604</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="LymphImmune"><Rcn>107069</Rcn><Nid>9922</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Flow in the tumor microenvironment: Linking mechanobiology with immunology</Name><PI>Melody Ann Swartz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Tumors often engage the lymphatic system to invade and metastasize. The tumor-draining lymph node (dLN) may be an immune privileged site that protects the tumor from host immunity, and lymph flow draining tumors is often increased, enhancing communication between the tumor and the sentinel node.  In addition to increasing transport of tumor antigens and regulatory cytokines to the lymph node, increased lymph flow in the tumor margin causes mechanical stress-induced changes in stromal cells that stiffen the matrix and alter the immune microenvironment of the tumor. In this proposed project, we will investigate the interplay between lymphatic drainage and flow-induced mechanotransduction in the tumor stroma that may synergize to promote tumor immune escape by appropriating lymphatic mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. We will address the hypothesis that lymphatic drainage and flow-induced mechanotransduction in the tumor stroma synergistically promote tumor immune escape by altering the immune microenvironment, and that targeting lymphatic drainage from the tumor may represent a new avenue for tumor immunotherapy. For the latter, we will develop strategies to limit or block lymphatic flow in the tumor microenvironment and characterize their ability to improve the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy by dampening local immunosuppression in the tumor stroma and tumor-draining lymph node (dLN).

The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the transcriptional control of lymphocyte development at three stages by deciphering the transcriptional networks specifying pro-B and pro-T cells in early lymphopoiesis and plasma cells in terminal B cell differentiation.
To this end, we generated knock-in mice carrying a biotin acceptor sequence at the C-terminus of transcription factors, which can be biotinylated by transgenic co-expression of the E. coli biotin ligase BirA. In vivo biotinylation facilitates antibody-independent precipitation of these transcription factors by streptavidin pulldown (Bio-ChIP). Preliminary Bio-ChIP sequencing experiments validated this approach for genome-wide identification of transcription factor target genes.
Bio-ChIP sequencing will be used to identify the target genes of key transcription factors controlling the development of pro-B cells (Ikaros, E2A, STAT5, EBF1, Pax5, PU.1, IRF4), pro-T cells (Notch1, RBP-J&#239;&#129;&#171;, GATA3, Ikaros, E2A, STAT5) and plasma cells (Blimp1, IRF4, XBP1). RNA sequencing of wild-type and mutant lymphocytes will determine the regulated target genes of these factors, which are ultimately relevant for the elucidation of transcriptional networks. The function of selected target genes at central nodes of these networks will be analyzed by the latest miR30-shRNA knockdown technology. Finally, regulatory complexes interacting with these transcription factors will be identified by streptavidin-pulldown purification and mass spectrometry followed by their integration into the transcriptional networks by ChIP-seq mapping to the transcription factor target genes.
These experiments will provide fundamentally new molecular insight into the generation of all three lymphocyte stages and will contribute to a better understanding of how deregulation of the transcriptional control promotes the development of lymphoid malignancies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,305</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MASS-CARE"><Rcn>108671</Rcn><Nid>9461</Nid><HI>Stichting Vu, Netherlands</HI><Name>Molecular Self Screening for Cervical Cancer Prevention</Name><PI>Christophorus Meijer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cervical carcinoma is a preventable cancer caused by a persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (hrHPV). Several western countries have implemented nation-wide screening programs based on the detection of abnormal cells in cervical smears (cytology) for cervical cancer prevention. Although these programs have markedly reduced incidence in developed countries, even the most sophisticated cytology-based screening programs miss significant numbers of high-grade cervical lesions and fail to further reduce cervical cancer incidence. Besides loss to follow-up of women with abnormal cytology, the major causes underlying failure are:

- Low sensitivity of the primary cytology based screening test, which is subjective, often not or poorly quality assessed (QA) and has low sensitivity for precancerous lesions
- Incomplete coverage of women invited to participate in the screening program

Remarkably, in developed countries with a successful nation-wide cervical screening programme 55% of all carcinomas are diagnosed in women who do not participate. Moreover, the lack of QA cytology in medium and low resource countries is one of the main reasons why incidence and mortality stay high in these countries.

In recognition of these shortcomings the MASS-CARE project envisions a novel, objective, full molecular self-screening approach that enables molecular screening and triage for referral to the gynaecologist using self-collected cervico-vaginal samples as an alternative tool for cervical cancer screening. In particular, we aim to discover molecular triage markers specific for the stratification of women with hrHPV positive self-samples.

However, definitive evidence for MC functions in areas as important as innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, transplant rejection, vascular diseases, tumour growth, and wound healing are currently mostly lacking. A major hurdle in this field is the lack of a genetically-defined mouse mutant selectively deficient in all MC. The available MC-deficiency models are based on mutations in the pleiotropic growth factor receptor Kit. Kit mutations cause many defects in multiple lineages inside and outside of the immune system, are mostly unavailable on pure genetic backgrounds, and are difficult to combine with other gain or loss of function mutations. We have now generated a new mouse strain that is selective MC-deficient. Cre recombinase (Cre)-mediated MC eradication takes advantage of the genotoxic property of Cre, and does not require Cre-mediated deletion of loxP-flanked genes in MC. These MC-deficient mice are now available for the proposed project on pure C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse backgrounds. For proof of principle, we are not only demonstrating that MC are absent from these mutants but also provide evidence that these MC-deficient inbred mice behave very differently compared to MC-deficient, Kit-deficient mice in classical assays previously used to suggest in vivo MC functions. Based on these findings, and given the need for conclusive in vivo studies to advance this area of immunology, I propose to develop and lead a research program addressing the in vivo functions of MC in key areas of immunology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,880,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MAXMAP"><Rcn>98994</Rcn><Nid>11192</Nid><HI>Gregor-Mendel-Institut F&#195;&#188;r Molekulare Pflanzenbiologie Gmbh, Austria</HI><Name>Developing maximum-resolution genotype-phenotype maps using whole-genome polymorphism data</Name><PI>Lars Magnus Henrik Nordborg</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Although pioneered by human geneticists as a potential solution to the challenging problem of finding the genetic basis of common human diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have, owing to advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, become an obvious general approach for studying the genetics of natural variation. They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost-effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we propose to continue our groundbreaking GWAS work in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We will explore the limits of the approach, moving beyond marker-trait linkage disequilibrium to full sequence information. We will carry out GWAS of important life-history traits using over 1000 inbred A. thaliana lines for which nearly complete sequence information is available. The GWAS will be complemented by linkage mapping in F2 crosses to eliminate confounding linkage disequilibrium, associations will be verified experimentally, and confirmed causal polymorphisms will be added to the model in an iterative manner in order to create an increasingly refined genotype-phenotype map."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,183,956</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MCs-inTEST"><Rcn>188502</Rcn><Nid>10649</Nid><HI>"biomedical Sciences Research Center ""alexander Fleming""", Greece</HI><Name>Mesenchymal Cells of the Lamina Propria in Intestinal Epithelial and Immunological Homeostasis</Name><PI>Georgios Kollias</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Mesenchymal cells (MCs) of the intestinal lamina propria refer to a variety of cell types, most commonly intestinal myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, pericytes, and mesenchymal stromal cells, which show many similarities in terms of origin, function and molecular markers. Understanding the physiological significance of MCs in epithelial and immunological homeostasis and the pathophysiology of chronic intestinal inflammatory and neoplastic disease remains a great challenge.
In this proposal, we put forward the challenging hypothesis that, especially during acute or chronic inflammatory and tumorigenic conditions, MCs play important physiological roles in intestinal homeostasis regulating key processes such as epithelial damage, regeneration and tumorigenesis, intestinal inflammation and lymphoid tissue formation. We further posit that a unifying principle underlying such functions would be the innate character of MCs, which we hypothesize are capable of directly sensing and metabolizing innate signals from microbiota or cytokines in order to exert homeostatic epithelial and immunological regulatory functions in the intestine.
We will be using genetic approaches to target innate pathways in MCs and state of the art phenotyping to discover the physiologically important signals orchestrating intestinal homeostasis in various animal models of intestinal pathophysiology. We will also study MC lineage relations and plasticity during disease and develop ways to interfere therapeutically with MC physiology to achieve translational added value for intestinal diseases, as well as for a range of other pathologies sharing similar characteristics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,590,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MEDEA"><Rcn>99425</Rcn><Nid>9528</Nid><HI>Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Microbial Ecology of the DEep Atlantic pelagic realm</Name><PI>Gerhard Herndl</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The project aims at elucidating a major enigma in microbial ecology, i.e., the metabolic activity of prokaryotic communities in the deep sea under in situ pressure conditions, rather than under surface pressure conditions, as commonly done.

A role of epigenetic processes in evolution, however, has found little general support to date. The goal of this project is to understand the complex interplay of epigenetic mechanisms in plant development and evolution. Many of the approaches we use rely on the recent advances in sequencing technologies, which allow the analysis of molecular characters at an unprecedented level and speed. To achieve our goal, we will focus on two epigenetic paradigms. In Program A, we will focus on dissecting the mechanisms of genomic imprinting at the MEDEA (MEA) locus in Arabidopsis, which we will investigate using genetic, molecular, and innovative biochemical approaches to gain a comprehensive picture of the complex interplay of various epigenetic pathways. In program B, we will analyze the role of epigenetic change in adaptation and evolution using (i) an experimental selection approach in Arabidopsis, where genome-wide analyses of epigenetic modifications have become possible, and (ii) a stable, heritable, epigenetic change occurring in Mimulus populations. In this system, an epigenetic switch of the pollinator syndrome leads to reproductive isolation and, therefore, has an effect on population structure and thus the evolutionary trajectory. These experimental systems each offer unique opportunities to shed light onto the underlying mechanisms controlling epigenetic states.

In contrast, almost no information is available concerning how membrane proteins fold in vivo. Mainly, this is because of a lack of suitable assays to follow the folding process.  The main objective of this proposal is to develop a broad range of new methods, largely based on chemical-biology approaches combined with protein engineering, to study membrane protein insertion, folding, and assembly in vivo or under in vivo-like conditions. We will aim for quantitative studies whenever possible. Questions we will address include: What are the in vivo kinetics of transmembrane-helix integration? What are the energetics of membrane insertion of non-natural amino acid side chains with physico-chemical properties distinct from those of the 20 natural amino acids? What kinds of residue-residue interactions drive interactions between transmembrane helices and between membrane protein subunits? How should we best design and verify novel interacting transmembrane helices?

This proposal addresses the major challenge of membrane protein folding. Here, I intend to make a step change to my pioneering biophysical studies and investigate co-translational membrane protein folding. A central feature will be the creation of synthetic systems to probe key events in co-translational folding, as the protein folds in the membrane whilst emerging from the ribosome. An ambitious target is to make these systems tuneable, which will provide a new tool for the fabrication of membrane proteins and artificial cells in Synthetic Biology. The assembly of a tuneable artificial module that affords control over membrane protein synthesis is unprecedented.
I focus on the ubiquitous superfamily of major facilitator proteins, namely the best studied family member, lactose permease, LacY. This proposal has state of the art biophysical mechanistic studies at its core, which interleave into Cell and Synthetic Biology. There are two themes:
Theme 1. Determination of fundamental membrane protein folding parameters: folding transition  states and lipid control
Phi-value analysis will be used to probe the folding transition state of LacY; the first such analysis of a multi-domain membrane protein. Lipid parameters that control LacY folding will be quantified, including bilayer asymmetry using novel droplet interface bilayer methods.
Theme 2: construction of tuneable synthetic co-translational folding systems
Engineered ribosomes and translocon insertion machinery will be incorporated and LacY folding will be controlled. Translation will be regulated or halted using mutant ribosomes, arrest sequences, altered codon usage and controlling tRNA addition. Trapped LacY folding intermediates will be studied using biophysical methods.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,312,389</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="META-GROWTH"><Rcn>109426</Rcn><Nid>12475</Nid><HI>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany</HI><Name>Metabolic regulation of growth and body composition: key modulators of long-term health</Name><PI>Berthold Koletzko</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Nutrient exposure during pregnancy and childhood strongly affects growth and induces persistent metabolic programming of lifelong health. Recent data show that obesity and related disorders are induced by both fast childhood weight gain, and by formula feeding that promotes higher weight gain than breastfeeding. Lower protein in infant formula at levels similar to breast milk normalizes early weight gain and reduces later obesity risk as much as 2.5fold. Optimizing growth through improved substrate supply is of major importance for health prevention, but information is lacking on key mediators, effects on body composition and mechanisms of action, e.g. epigenetic modification. We use innovative approaches to identify key substrates that may mediate growth and body composition in humans, e.g. branched chain amino acids, n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and others, and their epigenetic effects. We employ novel methods for high throughput targeted metabolomic and lipidomic profiling, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, and state of the art bioinformatics. These powerful tools are applied to five well designed prospective cohort studies covering critical time periods from pregnancy to puberty. All cohorts offer precise phenotyping incl. body composition and are already or will be established. Comparative analyses across studies and populations provide added scientific value. We will identify which metabolic signals induce rapid weight gain and body fat deposition throughout childhood. We aim at identifying susceptible age periods, nutrient effects on epigenetic DNA methylation, and whether early metabolic exposures induce persistent or fluid metabolomic and epigenetic changes over time. The results should provide answers to key questions on the regulation of growth, with major benefit for scientific understanding, opportunities for future research, promotion of public health, nutrition recommendations, and development of improved food products.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="METABOLOMIRS"><Rcn>94144</Rcn><Nid>8819</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Elucidation of MicroRNAs as Regulators of Metabolism and Targets for Therapeutic Intervention</Name><PI>Markus Stoffel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Small RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression is a recent addition to fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms that directly or indirectly affect possibly every gene of a eukaryotic genome. The predominant sources of small RNA in somatic tissues are microRNA genes that encode short dsRNA hairpins of evolutionary conserved sequence. Disorders of metabolism, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are poorly understood at a molecular level. In this application we propose to explore if miRNA regulatory networks play a role in these diseases. We will employ state of the art methods for identification of small RNAs and their regulated targets and use biochemical, cell and animal model systems to study the detailed molecular mechanisms of metabolic gene regulation by miRNAs. In addition, we will investigate the underlying principles of how RNAs are taken up by cells and develop methods that will improve delivery of miRNA mimetics or inhibitors through cell-specific uptake. The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1: To define the small regulatory miRNA content of liver, muscle and adipose tissue that are associated with abnormal glucose and lipid homeostasis and to dissect the underlying molecular pathways that govern their expression. Aim 2: To characterize the functions of miRNAs in insulin resistance, glucose uptake and production, fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis. Aim 3: To identify factors and dissect the pathways that regulate RNA uptake by cells and to develop novel pharmacological treatment strategies to manipulate miRNA-expression. Together, this proposal will shed light on the function that miRNA regulatory networks play in metabolism and in the pathophysiology of obesity/type 2 diabetes. In addition, these studies will contribute to the development of new RNA delivery technologies that are urgently needed as experimental tools as well as for novel therapeutic strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,021,235</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="METABOp53"><Rcn>106901</Rcn><Nid>12893</Nid><HI>The Beatson Institute For Cancer Research, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Metabolic functions of p53 in non-cancer pathologies</Name><PI>Karen Vousden</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Extensive study of the p53 protein has resulted in a detailed understanding of its role in tumour suppression, information that is being used to develop small molecule modulators of p53 that are presently under evaluation for cancer therapy. However, it has recently become clear that p53 also plays roles in aspects of human health and disease extending beyond cancer - although most of these are poorly understood. We therefore propose to investigate some of these non-cancer functions of p53, with an emphasis on the role of p53 in the regulation of metabolism, extending to an analysis of whether p53 contributes to pathologies such as diabetes and obesity. This is a pioneering project that brings p53 research into new areas, yet builds on the solid platform of existing knowledge about the regulation and function of p53. State of the art genomic, proteomic, metabolomic and imaging analyses will be used to identify the roles of p53 in the response to metabolic stress caused by nutrient deficiency or excess, and investigate how these activities balance cell survival and cell death. Models will be developed to address how these functions of p53 relate to the control of metabolism and disease in vivo. Understanding how the cellular response to metabolic stress is controlled, and identifying a role for p53 in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis has enormous potential to influence the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The proposal will help to define the role of p53 in the development of diabetes and obesity, and lay the groundwork for the investigation of a role for p53 in other pathologies, such as neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease and liver disease. These studies will therefore have far-reaching impact on some of the most prominent health threats in the developed world.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,437,814</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="METAPHEN"><Rcn>107855</Rcn><Nid>12861</Nid><HI>University Of Glasgow, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The ecology of metabolic phenotypes: from cells to populations</Name><PI>Neil Benedict Metcalfe</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Metabolic rate is a fundamental life history trait. Yet it also shows remarkable intra-specific variation: some individuals consistently have 2-3 times the maintenance costs of conspecifics the same size, age and sex. The predicted consequences of this variation are central to our understanding of optimal life history strategies and resource allocation trade-offs. But how is this intra-specific variation maintained? And why have attempts to link variation in metabolic rate to fitness yielded very inconsistent results? I propose that this is due to the focus having been on resting metabolism, with other aspects &#226;&#128;&#147; most notably maximal metabolic rate and aerobic scope - being overlooked.  There is pronounced variation in these two neglected components of metabolic profile, uncorrelated with that in resting metabolism, and increasing evidence that they may influence species distributions. I point out that these different components of metabolic rate are inextricably linked to levels of mitochondrial uncoupling, and hence to energy efficiency, potential oxidative stress and senescence. I predict that different microhabitats will favour specific combinations of metabolic traits, leading to spatial and temporal structuring of metabolic phenotypes within and across populations. This project aims to test this new framework in a multidisciplinary project that uses experimental manipulations at levels ranging from the cellular to the population. The project combines cellular analyses and cutting edge technology with carefully designed experiments in an ecological setting. I will test whether variability in metabolic traits is maintained through context-dependent fitness. If successful, the work will reveal how metabolic physiology is a key determinant of the ability of organisms to cope with variable environments, so explaining the persistence of variation in physiological traits and increasing our understanding of the likely consequences for organisms of environmental change."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,253,716</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="METSTEM"><Rcn>98544</Rcn><Nid>9042</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>DNA methylation in stem cells</Name><PI>Howard Cedar</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Embryonic and adult stem cells constitute an important component of biology by providing a pool of pluri- and multi-potent cells that supply a variety of different cell lineages. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in establishing and maintaining cell &#194;&#191;stemness,&#194;&#191; but it is most likely controlled by epigenetic signals such as DNA methylation. This proposal aims to understand these mechanisms and decipher the molecular logic used to program this plasticity.

We have developed a new strategy for studying the &#194;&#191;DNA methylation potential&#194;&#191; of any cell type throughout normal development. This utilizes a unique set of transgenic vectors programmed to detect both de novo methylation as well as the ability to protect CpG islands, and will, for the first time, allow one to evaluate the role of demethylation in normal stem cells and during reprogramming. This will be done using a new technique called &#194;&#191;reverse epigenetics&#194;&#191;.

Preliminary studies indicate that embryonic stem cells differentiated in vitro undergo extensive aberrant methylation that does not reflect the normal pattern of methylation found in vivo. This artifact may be responsible for our inability to attain efficient differentiation in culture and may generate cells that are unhealthy and prone to cancer. We will characterize the causes of this phenomenon and decipher its underlying mechanism. This research should lead to the development of improved methods for tissue generation in vitro.

One of the most basic properties of adult stem cells is their ability to undergo asymmetric cell division that is often associated with unequal segregation of DNA. This mechanism is one of the most elemental, yet mysterious, aspects of stem cell biology. We have developed a completely new molecular model for this process that is based on the idea that non-symmetric DNA methylation serves as a strand-specific marker, and it is very likely that this will enable us to finally decipher this basic aspect of stem cells."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,941,930</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MEXTIM"><Rcn>185408</Rcn><Nid>11592</Nid><HI>John Innes Centre, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Measurement of temperature exposure and integration over time</Name><PI>Caroline Dean</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"All organisms have to cope with changing temperature and various mechanisms have evolved to protect cellular processes against thermal stresses. Many organisms also use temperature signals to align behaviour and development with certain seasons. How specific temperature cues are extracted from fluctuating temperature levels is unknown but it implies the existence of mechanisms that enable long-term monitoring and integration of the enormously variable temperature levels found in nature. We therefore intend to discover how variable temperature levels are measured and integrated over long timescales in order to provide information used in biological timing. Plants provide an excellent system in which to investigate such thermo-sensory mechanisms. We will exploit our knowledge of the multiple regulatory pathways determining quantitative expression of the plant developmental repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). These pathways, which are all independently influenced by temperature, converge to regulate FLC via aspects of a co-transcriptional mechanism involving antisense transcripts and different chromatin pathways. This understanding provides the system to define the primary temperature steps (thermo-sensors) that directly regulate FLC and explore how they combine to record complex temperature profiles. Our hypothesis is that different thermo-sensors monitor distinct aspects of the long-term temperature profile. Their outputs would be integrated via accumulation of chromatin modifications at FLC with feedback and interconnection between the pathways providing reinforcement systems to record previous exposure. Modulation of this mechanism would then provide the basis for adaptation to different climates.

In a complicated series of cell biological events, they catch a peptide in the endosomal route for presentation at the plasma membrane to the immune system. At present some 20 factors have been identified as involved in the process of MHC class II antigen presentation that are potential targets for manipulating these responses as MHC class II molecules are involved in most auto-immune diseases. Defining further targets for manipulating MHC class II responses would have implications for various disease states when these can be inhibited by chemical compounds or biologicals. We have performed a genome-wide FACS-based siRNA screen for molecules affecting MHC class II expression and peptide loading. After 100.000 individual 2-color FACS analyses, we identified 276 proteins that can be functionally sub-clustered for expression and for cell biological effects. We now propose to study the cell biology of these 276 hits to elucidate the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of MHC class II antigen presentation (the MHC class II-ome). As a first step, the 276 hits are sub-clustered for effects on MHC class II transcription or cell biology. These sub-clusters may correspond to networks. We propose to validate and extend these networks by experiments by a team of scientists concentrating on the various aspects of the cell biology of MHC class II antigen presentation. A parallel chemical compound screen will be performed to identify compounds affecting MHC class II antigen presentation. By cross-correlating the biological phenotypes of compounds with those of siRNA silencing, novel target-lead combinations will be defined by reciprocal chemical genetics. Our experiments should result in a global understanding of MHC class II antigen presentation. In addition, it should reveal target-lead combinations for manipulation of MHC class II antigen presentation in infection, auto-immune disease and transplantation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,112,300</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MICROBESINSIDE"><Rcn>94582</Rcn><Nid>8756</Nid><HI>Wageningen University, Netherlands</HI><Name>Exploitation of Our Intestinal Microbiota</Name><PI>Willem Meindert De Vos</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Our intestinal tract is colonized by a myriad of microbes that exceed our body cells in number and coding capacity and have important metabolic and signaling functions. Analysis of the diversity of these microbes inside revealed more than 1000 species, some of which have developed intimate interactions that are operating at the mucus interface separating the intestinal and microbial cells. Notably, we sustain and stimulate these interactions by feeding our microbes inside by the production of large amounts of mucus that equal the undigested components of our diet in caloric value. The understanding of the mucosal interactions is of great importance as they affect our immune system, signal to the brain-gut axis and provide a protective barrier against pathogens. Hence, this project aims to obtain fundamental understanding in the diversity and function of our microbes inside with a focus on mucus-binding bacteria that are either indigenous in the human intestine or ingested as part of our diet. The project will capitalize on (i) the recently developed high-throughput functional (meta)genomics approaches for human subjects, (ii) the genomic characterization of the mucus-degrading species Akkermansia muciniphila, an emerging biomarker for a healthy intestine, and (iii) the genome-driven discovery that the paradigm probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), contains cell-wall extended pili that strongly bind mucus and signal to human cells.

The project has a theoretical part where individual based models will be used to represent life strategies, adaption and evolution at the cell level - allowing microbial diversity to evolve as a product of the models. The theoretical work will be challenged with experimental work at two levels: the effect of host-virus interactions on biodiversity within microbial communities, and the effect of predation on structuring the balance between communities of osmotrophic microorganisms (bacteria and phytoplankton).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,937</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MIRIAM"><Rcn>102563</Rcn><Nid>12394</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Mismatch repair interactome and mutagenesis</Name><PI>Josef Jiricny</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The mismatch repair (MMR) system has evolved to correct errors of DNA replication and prevent recombination between non-homologous sequences. Correspondingly, MMR malfunction leads to increased mutation rates and illegitimate recombination, and individuals with inherited MMR gene mutations are predisposed to cancer of the colon and other organs. However, MMR has recently been implicated in processes ranging from DNA damage signaling and drug sensitivity to antibody maturation, some of which contradict and even subvert the classical role of MMR as a guardian of genomic integrity. We suspect that the latter processes are linked to a new, non-canonical MMR (ncMMR) pathway that can be activated outside of the S- and G2 phases of the cell cycle by a variety of lesions and structures. ncMMR lacks strand directionality, involves long stretches of DNA degradation, and our preliminary in vitro evidence suggests that resynthesis of these repair tracts can be mediated not only by high-fidelity, replicative polymerases, but also by error-prone enzymes. In this scenario, ncMMR would actually contribute to mutagenesis. I plan to deploy proteomic, genomic and imaging technologies to identify the components of the ncMMR &#226;&#128;&#156;mutasome&#226;&#128;&#157; and to reconstitute the system from purified recombinant components.

ATP deficiency leads to cellular dysfunction and ultimately death. In mammals, 13 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits interact with over 70 nuclear-encoded subunits to form four of the five MRC complexes. Many additional factors are essential for the regulation of MRC activity, and the maintenance and expression of mtDNA. As a result, genetic defects affecting either genome can compromise ATP synthesis and cause human disease. There is no effective treatment for mitochondrial disorders. Major hurdles to this achievement include (i) the still incomplete molecular definition of mitochondrial disease; (ii) the poorly understood function of many disease gene products, (iii) the difficulty to rationally manipulate the complex biochemical and genetic systems underpinning mitochondrial bioenergetics.
The ultimate scope of MitCare is to develop effective therapy in mitochondrial medicine. MitCare will implement three Workpackages (WP). WP1 will test the effects of pharmacological stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse disease models. WP2 will test the effects of Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV)- and lentiviral-mediated delivery of therapeutic genes, in mouse models and human mutant cells, respectively. Since the clinical features of human disorders often fail to be faithfully replicated in mice, WP3 will implement the creation of a mitochondrial disease model in the pig, whose proximity to humans is much closer than mice. The Surf1 gene, encoding an assembly factor of complex IV, will be disrupted by zincfinger nuclease technology in swine fibroblasts, which will then serve to clone a Surf1 knockout pig by somatic cell nuclear transfer. &#226;&#128;&#156;Mitopigs&#226;&#128;&#157; will be used to test the direct transferability of experimental treatments from suitable mammalian models to the clinics.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MITO BY-PASS"><Rcn>89773</Rcn><Nid>9192</Nid><HI>Tampereen Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Molecular by-pass therapy for mitochondrial dysfunction</Name><PI>Howard Trevor Jacobs</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Many eukaryotes, but not the higher metazoans such as vertebrates or arthropods, possess intrinsic by-pass systems that provide alternative routes for electron flow from NADH to oxygen. Whereas the standard mitochondrial OXPHOS system couples electron transport to proton pumping across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating the proton gradient which is used to drive ATP synthesis and other energy-requiring processes, the by-pass enzymes are non-proton-pumping, and their activity is redox-regulated rather than subject to ATP requirements. My laboratory has engineered two of these by-pass enzymes, the single-subunit NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1p from yeast, and the alternative oxidase AOX from Ciona intestinalis, for expression in Drosophila and mammalian cells. Their expression is benign, and the enzymes appear to be almost inert, except under conditions of redox stress induced by OXPHOS toxins or mutations. The research set out in this proposal will explore the utility of these by-passes for alleviating metabolic stress in the whole organism and in specific tissues, arising from mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction. Specifically, I will test the ability of Ndi1p and AOX in Drosophila and in mammalian models to compensate for the toxicity of OXPHOS poisons, to complement disease-equivalent mutations impairing the assembly or function of the OXPHOS system, and to diminish the pathological excess production of reactive oxygen species seen in many neurodegenerative disorders associated with OXPHOS impairment, and under conditions of ischemia-reperfusion. The attenuation of endogenous mitochondrial ROS production by deployment of these by-pass enzymes also offers a novel route to testing the mitochondrial (oxyradical) theory of ageing.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,436,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MITOSCAFFOLD"><Rcn>90405</Rcn><Nid>12298</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zu Koeln, Germany</HI><Name>Mitochondrial membrane organization by protein scaffolds and lipid dynamics</Name><PI>Thomas Rudolf Langer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Biological membranes are complex structures built up of a multiplicity of membrane lipids and proteins controlling essential cellular processes. This is exemplified by mitochondria, dynamic double-membrane bound organelles, with essential roles in diverse metabolic and cellular signalling pathways. The mitochondrial inner membrane is considered to be the protein richest cellular membrane, whose functional impairment is associated with aging, myopathies and diverse neurological disorders in human. Recent evidence from our group revealed essential roles of large, ring-like prohibitin complexes in the inner membrane for embryonic development in mice, cell proliferation, resistance against apoptosis, and the maintenance of mitochondrial cristae. Prohibitins comprise a conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein family and are suggested to serve as protein scaffolds in the inner membrane. Defining the network of genetic interactions in yeast, we could establish that prohibitin function depends on the supply of the non-bilayer phospholipids cardiolipin and phosphatidyl ethanolamine and on intramitochondrial lipid trafficking. These findings indicate that mitochondrial function and ultrastructure requires a defined spatial organization of the inner membrane, which is maintained by a defined lipid composition and prohibitins serving as protein scaffolds. Here, we propose a comprehensive analysis of the function of prohibitins and of novel components involved in mitochondrial lipid trafficking and phospholipid biosynthetic pathways. These studies will include genetic as well as biochemical and proteomic approaches and employ both yeast and murine models to integrate the molecular understanding of functionally conserved processes into the physiological context. As components of this system have been linked to cardiomyopathies and diverse neurological disorders, our studies are likely to provide new insight into pathomechanisms of human disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,878,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MITRAC"><Rcn>110813</Rcn><Nid>11391</Nid><HI>Universitaetsmedizin Goettingen - Georg-August-Universitaet Goettingen - Stiftung Oeffentlichen Rechts, Germany</HI><Name>Mitochondrial translational regulation coupled to respiratory chain assembly and protein import</Name><PI>Peter Rehling</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes assemble from nuclear- and mitochondria-encoded subunits in the inner membrane. To protect cells from accumulating unassembled subunits in the membrane, ROS generation, or damage of mitochondrial integrity, regulatory mechanisms to balance and control the fidelity of the assembly process have evolved, encorporating a retention system enabling the preservation of a select few founding complexes for on-demand assembly. In yeast mitochondria, a feedback mechanism has been identified for the cytochrome oxidase in which assembly-intermediates specifically inactivate translation of the core subunit Cox1. It is controversially debated if similar translation regulating mechanisms exist in human mitochondria. However, our recent findings show that in human mitochondria assembly intermediates of respiratory chain complexes affect translation, nevertheless the underlying sensing and signalling mechanisms as well as the protein components appear to be more complex than in yeast. We aim to understand how this regulatory cycle is established; how does a distinct assembly intermediate of cytochrome oxidase signal the translation system, and how the influx of imported subunits contributes to this process. These goals are conceptually deeply rooted in a comprehensive understanding of the membrane protein complex assembly process and the factors that promote its progression. These objectives are of key importance for understanding the molecular pathology of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies that are frequently due to respiratory chain assembly and quality control malfunction. The aim of our analyses is to provide insight as to how translation can be coupled to the assembly of a membrane protein complex comprised of subunits of dual genetic origin and to decipher mitochondrial translational regulation coupling to the influx of imported nuclear encoded subunits."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,283,817</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MODELIST"><Rcn>91083</Rcn><Nid>12664</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Understanding the infection by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes as a way to address key issues in biology</Name><PI>Pascale Cossart</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Host-pathogen interactions have recently received much attention.

We will exploit our deep knowledge of Listeria and use this bacterium as a model to explore new landmarks in biology.
In that aim, we will analyze several aspects of the infectious process, in a spatio-temporal fashion, at the bacteria, cell, tissue and host levels. Specifically, we will 1) search and analyze the function of new non-coding RNAs involved in virulence, and of new RNA-mediated regulations; 2) investigate new facets of bacterial entry and cell-to-cell spread in particular the role of uncharacterized cytoskeletal components, septins; 3) address the role of mitochondria and their dynamics in infection; 4) systematically analyze post-translational modifications during infection, starting with SUMOylation, a reversible modification and proteolysis, an irreversible one; 5) investigate chromatin remodeling upon infection; 6) characterize new virulence factors identified by their interaction with known signaling components or cellular sensors, by post genomics or by their effect on cellular responses analyzed herein ; 7) investigate further the intestinal phase of Listeria infection by analyzing in the germ-free transgenic mouse that we generated, the impact of commensals on Listeria (growth and transcription including non-coding RNAs) and on the intestinal tissue (histology and transcription of genes and microRNAs).

Genetic analysis over the last twenty years has provided us with a catalogue of genes and proteins that can be linked in linear and time dependent manners to specific states and transitions in this process. However this picture, characterized by complex charts of univocal relationships between different genes, is static and rigid and contrasts with the plasticity displayed by cells in many processes, in particular during repair and regeneration. The early mammalian embryo and the closely related ES cells provide extreme examples of this in the form of toti- and pluri-potency i.e. the maintenance of an open uncommitted state from which all cell types emerge. Understanding the molecular basis of these uncommitted states and the way they are established and regulated will not only provide a deeper insight into the operation of biological systems but will also new targets for regulation and therapies. This project revolves around the hypothesis that the plasticity displayed by cells in developmental and regulative processes is associated with dynamical cellular heterogeneities generated by transcriptional noise: phenotypic variability in genetically identical cells that arises from stochastic fluctuations during transcription and translation.

This is so because all cellular processes controlled by proteins can ultimately be traced back to physico-chemical properties encoded in their aminoacid sequences. MOLRHEOSTAT is framed within these goals, focusing on the investigation of novel connections between protein folding and function via a multidisciplinary approach that combines experiment (single molecule spectroscopy, high-resolution NMR, protein engineering and design), theory and computer simulations.
Conventionally, proteins are portrayed as conformational switches that fold and function by flipping between an on-state (native, active) and an off-state (inactive, unfolded) in response to stimuli. However, last years have witnessed the discovery of protein modules that undergo continuous conformational changes upon unfolding (downhill folding).  MOLRHEOSTAT aims at investigating the functional and technological implications of downhill folding. The goal is to determine whether downhill folding modules can be exploited to build conformational rheostats; that is, proteins that continuously modulate a signal or response at the single molecule level by tuning their folding conformational ensemble. Conformational rheostats could open a new realm of applications as synthetic biomolecular devices as well as regulatory mechanisms for controlling complex biochemical processes carried out by macromolecular assemblies. These ideas will be explored on two specific objectives:
1) Implementation of a general approach for building high-performance, ultrafast, single-molecule sensors based on downhill protein folding modules.
2) Analysis of the roles of conformational rheostats in the regulation of three fundamental processes in molecular biology (coordination in protein networks, DNA sliding and homing-to-target of transcription factors, and molecular springs in macromolecular assemblies).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MONOTOMACRO"><Rcn>110999</Rcn><Nid>10153</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Studying in vivo differentiation of monocytes into intestinal macrophages and their impact on gut homeostasis</Name><PI>Steffen Jung</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Monocytes are central players in inflammation. Progress in understanding their differentiation in target tissues bears potential to manipulate their activities for therapeutic purposes. Here we propose to study the generation of intestinal macrophages (M&#206;&#166;s) as a paradigm, taking advantage of a unique experimental system to elucidate in vivo monocyte fates.
The intestine hosts billions of bacteria that assist food uptake, but also pose a challenge, as we have to tolerate these beneficial commensals, yet rapidly mount immune responses to invading pathogens. Failure to maintain this balance causes inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD). Gut resident M&#206;&#166;s are key players in gut homeostasis and inflammation. Here we will study molecular parameters governing their generation from monocytes, as well as their interactions with the immediate tissue surrounding under pathological conditions. We focus on the molecular mechanisms leading to education of monocytes in small and large intestine using genome wide profiling of gene expression, chromatin state and transcription factor binding of monocytes and M&#206;&#166;s.

The major cause of asthma morbidity, mortality and health care costs are acute exacerbations, with rhinovirus infection the major cause. The aim of this application is to identify novel targets for the development of new more effective therapies for treatment and prevention of virus-induced asthma exacerbations, a disease area where there is a major unmet current clinical need.   This proposal combines two unique state of the art novel models of acute exacerbations of asthma. First, a human model will be used to identify dysregulated genes/proteins and determine relationships with disease outcomes in vivo. This study will compare lower airway responses between asthmatic and control subjects undergoing rhinovirus experimental infection. This will have the dual advantage of investigating mechanisms in the most natural model possible, as well as developing a better model for testing novel therapeutic approaches. The second utilizes a unique new mouse model of rhinovirus infection in which causal relationships with disease outcomes can be investigated in vivo. This will be performed using gene-knockout mice, blocking antibodies, siRNA, pharmacologic inhibition and/or over-expression in genes in a novel mouse model of rhinovirus exacerbation.  Any genes/proteins shown to be dysregulated and related to disease outcomes in the human model, AND causally related to disease outcomes in the mouse in vivo model will be very strong candidates for immediate translation of approaches to correct the dysregulation in proof of concept pivotal human intervention studies.

So far, research in the field has been mainly based on qualitative observations of mutants, with little considerations for the physics of the cells and tissues leaving many questions unanswered or unexplored. Here, using recent technological advances, to which the applicant has largely contributed, we propose an interdisciplinary and quantitative analysis of molecular and biophysical growth parameters from the cell to the organ level.
Because the mechanical properties of the cell wall are generally accepted to control local growth rates and directions, their contribution to morphogenesis will be the central focus. How the molecular regulatory networks, including cell identity genes, influence cell wall synthesis and structure to induce local growth rates and directions is largely unknown at present, mainly because our knowledge lacks integration at different levels of complexity. In addition to the quantitative and interdisciplinary character of this proposal, an original aspect of the project will address the multi-scale nature of a growing tissue, establishing a causality link between local wall properties and multi-cellular outputs.
To address this issue, we will combine cutting edge live imaging tools and micromechanical approaches with modelling frameworks recently developed in our laboratory. This will be performed using the developing flower in Arabidopsis, one of the best studied systems in biology and which has the strong advantage to grow without cell migration or rearrangement, vastly facilitating the dialog between the observations and the predictions from the models.
In summary, using different interdisciplinary concepts and methods, developed in our laboratory and coming from biology, physics and computer science, we will produce for the first time a mechanistic and multi-scale view of the growing flower bud.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,368,004</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MORPHOGEN"><Rcn>111068</Rcn><Nid>10141</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; De Gen&#195;&#168;ve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Morphogenetic growth control by time derivatives of signaling</Name><PI>Marcos Antonio Gonzalez Gaitan</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>How do na&#195;&#175;ve cells in a developing tissue know when to divide and when to stop dividing when the tissue reaches its final size?

While the mechanisms of patterning are starting to be understood, the mechanism of growth by morphogens is not yet deciphered.
In a few recent reports, we studied the biophysics and cell biology of the Dpp morphogen gradient during growth of Drosophila imaginal discs. We showed that the Dpp gradient expands and scales with the size of the growing tissue. Scaling occurs by the regulation of Dpp lysosomal degradation as a function of tissue size. We also showed that any cell in the developing tissue (no matter the developmental stage, the position of the cell in the gradient or the imaginal disc considered) divides when it sees an increase of Dpp signaling by &#206;&#177;=50% from the beginning of the cell cycle. The proliferation rate g of cells is proportional to the relative time derivative of signaling (i.e. C &#204;&#135;/C, the time derivative of Dpp signaling level C &#204;&#135; (Cdot) normalized to the actual signaling level C): g=(ln2/&#206;&#177;)*(Cdot/C).

Some major axon tracts including the corpus callosum contain a majority of unmyelinated axons even in maturity, suggesting that at least some of the adult-born oligodendrocytes might myelinate previously naked axons.  This would be expected to alter dramatically the conduction properties of the newly-myelinated axons and the properties of the circuits in which they participate, contributing to neural plasticity.

It has been known for a long time that proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (also known as NG2 cells) in the developing CNS is controlled in part by electrical activity in axons.  More recently, it was shown that NG2 cells form synapses with axons (""axoglial synapses"") and receive electrical stimulation from passing action potentials.  This suggests that NG2 cells are &#226;&#128;&#156;listening in&#226;&#128;&#157; to electrical activity which, at some threshold, might stimulate them to differentiate and myelinate the active axon(s).  MRI imaging of human brain has revealed that white matter volume continues to increase into the fourth decade of life and that specific tracts can undergo structural changes in response to complex activities such as piano playing or juggling.  These and other observations raise the intriguing possibility that motor skills learning and motor memory might depend on new myelination.  Testing this startling new idea is at the core of my proposed program of research.  We shall investigate 1) the role of axoglial synapses in regulating NG2 cell proliferation and differentiation in the adult CNS and 2) the role of NG2 cells and myelin genesis in motor learning.

A major current trend is the introduction of magnets with much more powerful static magnetic fields, including magnets at 7 Tesla (7T) and higher. Advantages of higher magnetic fields include higher signal-to-noise ratios enabling improved spatial and temporal resolution, and new, unique tissue contrasts due to enhanced sensitivity to tissue susceptibility differences.

Unfortunately, the radiofrequency (RF) fields used to excite tissue at higher magnetic fields are subject to interference and penetration effects, leading to signal dropouts which vary from subject to subject depending on body habitus. These effects imply that the inherent advantages of 7T often cannot be leveraged to realise practical imaging benefits. A fair evaluation of the diagnostic potential of 7T cannot be achieved, as image quality improvements are handicapped and often counteracted by these unresolved technical hurdles. 7T MRI cannot be considered for routine clinical use or even effectively evaluated for such use until these hurdles have been overcome.

Preliminary research indicates that these effects can be addressed by use of parallel transmission strategies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a highly optimized multi-channel transmit/receive RF coil for body MRI at 7T. This coil should then be used to exploit and manipulate the complex RF field patterns at 7T using parallel transmission approaches.

We hypothesise that such an approach would greatly enhance the flexibility of RF manipulation while limiting overall system complexity.

Experiments on the cell and microcircuit level need hypothesis from theory in order to drive the experimental search for plasticity rules and organize the vast amount of data collected in different labs across Europe and the world. Potential links between synaptic plasticity rules and behavioural outcomes need to be established by mathematical analysis and computer simulation on the systems level, and could ultimately also lead to novel therapeutical approaches.

Both theoretical and experimental approaches to synaptic plasticity have been dominated, in the past 30 years, by Hebb&#194;&#191;s rule but the Hebbian framework is a limitation, because it focuses only on two factors: the activity of the presynaptic (sending) neuron and that of the postsynaptic (receiving) one. Hence it neglects additional factors, such as non-specific neuromodulators or global activity states of brain areas. Only very recently a few experiments have appeared that study STDP in the presence of neuromodulators.

In this project, I want to break with the preoccupation of Hebbian rules, and formulate and study rules of synaptic plasticity that combine the two Hebbian activity factors with one or multiple global factors. With the new theoretical framework for multi-factor learning rules, to be developed in this project, I will be able to guide the design of novel experiments so that experimental paradigms probe parameters that are relevant for learning. I will be able to make predictions for functional outcomes of learning on the behavioural level, and possibly provide novel strategies for learning of new memories, or unlearning of unpleasant ones.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,449,218</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MUMI"><Rcn>103738</Rcn><Nid>10588</Nid><HI>Klinikum Rechts Der Isar Der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Germany</HI><Name>Multimodal Molecular Imaging</Name><PI>Carl Markus Maximilian Schwaiger</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Imaging has become an integral part of diagnosis and staging of disease.

The main objective of this project is to deepen our knowledge on the molecular networks controlling normal muscle differentiation, and to identify their alteration in pathology. The state of art in this field is thoroughly advanced since well-established master regulators (transcriptional factors and miRNAs) have been deeply characterized and integrated in regulatory circuitries controlling muscle development and differentiation. However, recent discoveries point to the hierarchically relevant role of a previously disregarded class of transcripts, named long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), in the control of gene expression.
Therefore, a major objective of this project is to re-evaluate and re-design established molecular circuitries known to control muscle differentiation in the light of the contribution of this complex class of transcripts. In more general terms, the project will shed light on the biogenesis and function of lncRNAs and how they contribute to cellular and organismal biology.

Most of these proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus for sorting and subsequent delivery to the endosomes, cell surface, and the extracellular space. There is good understanding of this process of &#194;&#191;conventional&#194;&#191; protein secretion. Surprisingly, there is another class of cytoplasmic proteins that are secreted even though they a lack signal sequence to enter the ER. How are such proteins secreted? The yeast protein a-factor achieves this goal by direct transport across the plasma membrane via an ABC transporter encoded by the STE6 gene. Little else of significance is known about this &#194;&#191;unconventional&#194;&#191; secretory pathway.

Our new findings reveal that secretion of signal sequence lacking acyl-coA binding protein or Acb1 in Saccharomyces cerevisae and Pichia pastoris requires autophagy related genes, fusion of membranes with early endosomes, formation of multivesicular body and the plasma membrane fusion protein (t-SNARE) called Sso1p. Our results indicate that secretion of Acb1 is mediated by a secretory autophagosomes. The secretion of Acb1 therefore does not follow the same pathway as the a-factor. But how is Acb1 packed into an autophagosome and why doesn&#194;&#191;t the secretory autophagosome fuse with the vacuole? In other words what is the difference between a secretory and a degradative autophagosome? Does an autophagosome-like vesicle also secrete cytokines, which lack a signal sequence to enter the ER?  Our aim is to address these key questions. Many unconventionally secreted proteins regulate tissue organization, behavior (anxiety and addiction), angiogenesis, immune surveillance and diabetes. Understanding the mechanism of this poorly understood process is therefore of fundamental importance.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,206,963</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MUTAEDITING"><Rcn>188495</Rcn><Nid>11367</Nid><HI>Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Germany</HI><Name>Mutation-driven immunoediting of human cancer?</Name><PI>Hans-Georg Rammensee</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"It is well documented that each human cancer has acquired a large number of mutations (50-500), some of which are drivers for tumorigenicity, others of which are indolent passengers. It has also been established that such mutations can be recognized by the patient&#194;&#180;s T cells via the presentation of mutated peptides on HLA molecules of a tumor cell. If such immune responses against cancer mutations are generally relevant for cancer development (according to Paul Ehrlich&#194;&#180;s hypothesis), one can predict several consequences: 1) The spectrum of mutations found in an established tumor of a patient should be diminished for those that give rise to peptides presented by the HLA molecules of this patient, but not for peptides relevant for other HLA molecules. 2) In HLA-negative tumor cells, the spectrum of mutations (those that occurred after HLA loss) should no longer be dependent on the patient&#194;&#180;s HLA molecules. 3) A cancer patient should have T cells against mutations that occurred at an early point in cancer development but that are no longer present in the tumor at the time of diagnosis because of negative selection of such tumor cells by the immune response. The aim of this proposal is to test the hypothesis by studying these three predictions in a large cohort of cancer patients treated at the University Hospital of T&#195;&#188;bingen. Clinically relevant human cancer samples from several cancer entities will be tested for mutations by exome and transcriptome sequencing. Those mutations actually presented as HLA ligands will be analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the patient&#194;&#180;s T-cell repertoire against mutations will be analyzed. The result of this research should be the confirmation, the rejection, or an amendment of the hypothesis.

We will use next-generation DNA sequencing to create a multi-layered set of genome-wide profiles. We will analyze cultured mouse cells and developing tumors, the latter in a transgenic model of Myc-induced lymphoma. The profiles will include (i.) quantitative mapping of the RNA transcriptome (coding, non-coding and small RNAs), (ii.) protein-DNA interaction profiles, (iii.) epigenome profiling, (iv.) 3D-folding of genomic DNA, (v.) mutational analysis. These datasets will provide broad views and will answer pointed questions about the action of Myc. We will address the hypothesis that many Myc target genes may not be regulated at the level of net mRNA accumulation, but rather of co-transcriptional processing events. We will provide maps for the RNA-Polymerase II complex, transcriptional co-factors and histone-modifying enzymes. We will whether the Myc-binding sites that do not map within promoters may act as enhancers and/or replication origins. We will address the hypothesis that Myc contributes to reprogramming of the genome independently from its localized effects on target genes. We will also ask which genes are targets of mutations and/or epigenetic silencing in Myc-induced lymphoma. High-throughput functional genomics will be used to address which genes suppress or promote Myc-induced lymphoma.

The multiple roles that they play in the dynamics of intracellular membranes are only beginning to emerge. Recent findings from the research team have highlighted unexpected roles in membrane deformation and in membrane fission played by two myosins (myosin 1b and myosin II) functioning at the interface between the Golgi, TGN (Trans-Golgi Network) and endosomes. Building on these results, we propose to establish a comprehensive model describing how several myosins work in concert with F-actin and with microtubule-based motors for sustaining transport events and membrane dynamics in a region of the cell at the crossroads of complex trafficking pathways.
Towards this general objective, our main goals are:
Goal 1: to understand the role of myosin 1b in membrane deformation
Goal 2: to understand the role of nonmuscle myosin II in membrane fission
Goal 3: to characterize the actin structures required for myosin functions
Goal 4: to identify and to characterize other myosins functioning at the Golgi/TGN/endosome interface and to investigate their functional coordination
Goal 5: to understand how myosins are functionally coordinated with microtubule-based motors.
The function of myosins will be studied both at the cellular and physical level using two main original methodological approaches available to the research team: minimal in vitro assays (giant liposomes and membrane nanotubes) and normalized cell systems (micropatterns).

To understand how stem cells act it is crucial to study their behavior in their natural context. Following and manipulating an individual stem cell and its descendants on their path to differentiation has so far not been possible. We have recently developed new microscopy and image analysis tools that allow long term in vivo observations. Novel genetic tools allow to stochastically label individual cells and thus to follow all descendants derived from the cell initially marked. We have modified and adapted this technology for the fish system and will extend its potential to allow functional clonal analysis in vivo. The transparent fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) are ideally suited to combine advanced imaging and the genetic lineage manipulation of stem cells. This way the influence of genetic pathways implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation is directly addressed in vivo. Clones originating from single wild type or manipulated cells are followed in their in vivo context and the physiological consequences of this manipulation is directly measured. Individually labelled clones will be followed by DSLM 4D microscopy over periods of up to 7 days in juvenile and adult fish. We will interfere with signaling pathways and key transcription factors in these cells combining the brainbow approach with lineage specific gain- and loss-of-function. That way a specific color will indicate a specific experimental condition. We will focus on the path of decisions taken by retinal stem cells and their descendants on the one hand and on cells composing induced tumors on the other. This will be highly relevant for our understanding of stem cell and tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,562,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MeMeMe"><Rcn>108844</Rcn><Nid>9389</Nid><HI>Fondazione Irccs Istituto Nazionale Dei Tumori, Italy</HI><Name>Randomized controlled trial of metformin and dietary restriction to prevent age-related morbid events in people with metabolic syndrome</Name><PI>Franco Berrino</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Age&#226;&#128;&#147;related chronic diseases (ArCD) are complex non-linear processes that depends on a large number of interconnected genetic and metabolic pathways which should be tackled with a many faceted preventive strategy. Calorie-dense diet and sedentary lifestyle are responsible of the growing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which, together with tobacco, is the major preventable cause of ArCD, mediated by the increased availability of insulin, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines. In animals, calorie restriction (CR) is the most potent dietary intervention for preventing ArCD and prolonging life. In humans, we and others have shown that a sustainable CR, resulting in decreased prevalence of MetS, can be obtained through a comprehensive change in dietary habits, reducing animal food and refined carbohydrates, and increasing whole grain cereal products, legumes and vegetables, according to the Mediterranean and macrobiotic diet principles. Metformin (MET), an antidiabetic drug associated with decreased cancer incidence, activates the same gene pathways  activated by CR, including  AMPK/TSC, which reduces energy consuming processes, and cell proliferation  (through the inhibition of mTOR). We propose a placebo controlled randomised trial to test whether treatment with MET, with or without associated CR, reduces the incidence of major chronic diseases, such as cancer, myocardial infarction, stroke, and diabetes. We estimated that randomizing 2,000 women and men aged 55-74 at high risk of developing ArCD because of  MetS, shall provide over 90% power (at alpha = 0.05) to detect a significant 25 to 33% reduction of ArCD incidence in 5 years.

However, one idea that has persisted is that these mRGCs play little if any role in visual perception. Exciting new data challenge that view. Thus, we have recently described an extraordinarily extensive mRGC input to the primary visual pathway. This provides ~40% of neurones in the mouse visual thalamus with melanopsin signals, superimposed upon more conventional visual information. The discovery of this unexpected sensory input to the mammalian visual system raises several important questions: What does it contribute to vision? How is the melanopsin signal brought to the thalamus and how is it propagated/processed through higher visual centres? Does melanopsin help people with retinal degeneration (in which mRGCs long outlive rods and cones) to see?

For both fundamental and practical reasons, it is important to understand the biological actions of the ""arms race"" underlying virulence, pathogenesis and immune defense. The key weapon in this membrane attack is a class of proteins that upon activation undergo a dramatic conversion from water-soluble monomers to a large, membrane-inserted assembly. Both the human immune response and microbial pathogenesis rely on membrane disruption by perforin-like proteins for attack and counterattack. This protein superfamily encompasses perforin and complement pore-forming assemblies in the immune system, as well as the more distantly related bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.

vaccines in humans are antibody-based. Depending on the pathogen, specific B cell subsets are
mobilized and a variety of innate, intermediate or adaptive responses are produced. In some
cases these responses generate memory in anticipation of a re-encounter with the same pathogen.
B cells can also present antigens to T cells, and enhance or suppress immune responses,
depending in which T cell context they are primed.
The present project aims to describe new innate-like and memory B cell subsets and to
unravel the molecular switch allowing the differentiation and the long-term maintenance
into the memory program. This will be done by combining approaches in both humans and
mice, in order to reveal the analogies and the differences between these two immune
systems.
Our main specific aims are 1) to establish a reporter cell line that, by complementation with a
cDNA library from human centrocytes and memory B cells, should allow the identification of a
master gene able to trigger the memory program 2) to compare various antigenic and
endogenous stimuli in terms of formation of various innate-like and memory subsets, using a

To execute the necessary structural synaptic reorganisations needed to permanently embed novel memories in the brain, a complex and precisely orchestrated molecular machinery is activated. We have found that rapid down-regulation of Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) is one key element needed to allow permanent memories to form. Thus, our MemoFlex mice, with inducible overexpression of NgR1 in forebrain neurons, are severely impaired with respect to the ability to form lasting memories. When transgenic NgR1 is turned off in these mice, the ability to form lasting memories is restored. Several other genes are also involved in the process of consolidation of memories, including prompt activity-driven upregulation of BDNF. Very recently, we have discovered that Lotus, a newly identified negative regulator of NgR1, is also upregulated by activity, thus providing additional efficacy to the process of causing nerve endings to become temporarily insensitive to Nogo when plasticity is needed. Based on our experience with neurotrophic factors and the Nogo signaling system, and using additional transgenic mouse models, including the mtDNA Mutator mouse with premature, yet typical aging, NgR1 KO mice and mice modeling neurodegenerative diseases (such as APPSwePSEN mice and our MitoPark mice to model aspects of Alzheimer&#226;&#128;&#153;s and Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease, respectively) we will examine the formation of lasting normal and pathological (addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder) memories in adult and aging individuals with and without additional neurodegenerative genotypes known to include cognitive impariment. This research will further the understanding of mechanisms behind memory dysfunction and help the design of memory-improving stratetegies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,330,974</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MetaboMIT"><Rcn>99290</Rcn><Nid>9381</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Metabolic consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction</Name><PI>Anu Elina Wartiovaara</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal aims to clarify mitochondrial contribution to obesity and thinness, using carefully characterized mitochondrial disease and obese patient materials, and genetically modified disease models. Manifestations of mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) defects range from infantile multisystem disorders to adult-onset myopathies or neurodegeneration, and even aging-related wasting. Why defects in oxidative ATP production can lead to such variety of manifestations and tissue specificity is unknown. We have previously identified a number of gene defects that lead to RC disorders. In addition to neurological symptoms, these patients often show various metabolic manifestations:  specific gene defects associate with short stature and thinness, whereas others with metabolic syndrome or obesity. This implies that specific mitochondrial defects can have opposing effects for fat storage or utilization. The involved pathways may contribute to mitochondrial disease progression, but are unknown.
We propose to a) undertake a major clinical study on genetically defined, obese or thin, mitochondrial patients, and examine their metabolic phenotype in finest detail. These data will be compared to those from normal obesity, to search for common mechanisms between mitochondrial and general obesity. b) generate a set of disease models for mitochondrial disorders associated with obesity, and knock-out models for specific signallers for crossing with the disease models. c) identify in detail the involved regulatory pathways, and utilize these for searching chemical compounds that could modulate the response, and have therapeutic potential. The project has potential for major breakthroughs in the fields of mitochondrial disease pathogenesis and treatment, neurodegeneration and obesity.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MiRNA_AD"><Rcn>98817</Rcn><Nid>9360</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>Role of microRNA dysregulation in Alzheimers Disease</Name><PI>Bart Geert Alfons Paul De Strooper</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a major health problem in aging societies. Remarkable progress in the study of the rare genetic forms of the disease has lead to the identification of several key players like APP and the secretases, but the molecular basis of sporadic AD remains largely unresolved. The convergence of several factors (multicausality) has to be considered. miRNAs are crucially involved in normal brain functioning and integrity. Evidence obtained from analyzing a limited number of brains indicates that miRNA expression is affected in sporadic AD. We propose the hypothesis that such changes can affect normal functioning of neurons increasing their susceptibility to AD. We will document in 3 brain regions in &gt;100 sporadic AD patients and in &gt;100 controls alterations in miRNA expression and explore whether similar alterations can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid. This part of the study will firmly establish which miRNAs are altered in AD. We will then investigate the functional relevance of those miRNAs by gain and loss of function experiments in brains of zebra fish and mice. We will determine the target genes of the miRNA with genetic and proteomic approaches, and establish the functional networks controlled by those miRNA. We anticipate that this will lead to complete novel insights in the role of miRNAs in AD and in maintenance of brain integrity.  Our work is likely to have diagnostic relevance for AD and will identify novel drug targets for the disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MicRobE"><Rcn>101494</Rcn><Nid>12396</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Robustness, evolutionary optimality and plasticity of microbial signaling</Name><PI>Viktor Sourjik</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Most signaling and regulatory functions in the cell are executed by protein networks rather than by individual proteins, and it is therefore essential for biology to understand how the design and function of these networks have been shaped by the evolution. Despite differences in biological functions and molecular composition, all protein networks underlie similar evolutionary constrains on their performance and design, such as necessity to be robust against extra- and intracellular perturbations or to extract information from noisy environment. Moreover, although it can be assumed that a particular network has evolved to optimally solve certain problem, detailed quantitative analyses of optimality of the network performance are largely missing. Similarly little explored is the question of the network plasticity: how networks adapt to changing environmental conditions by adjustments of their structure and function, either regulating protein levels or undergoing microevolutionary changes. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate general features responsible for robustness and plasticity of cellular networks, using signaling networks in bacteria and yeast as well-tractable and relatively simple model systems. To achieve that, we will combine quantitative real-time analyses of the network function, primarily using high-throughput fluorescence microscopy, with computational modeling and with experimental microevolution, while exposing the networks to such common intra- and extracellular perturbations as variations in protein levels and in temperature. We expect our comparative analysis to provide general insights into the mechanisms of robustness and evolutionary optimization of cellular networks, thereby substantially advancing our understanding of biological systems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,490,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MicroInnate"><Rcn>98815</Rcn><Nid>12124</Nid><HI>The Provost, Fellows, Foundation Scholars &amp; The Other Members Of Board Of The College Of The Holy &amp; Undivided Trinity Of Queen Elizabeth Near Dublin, Ireland</HI><Name>An exploration into the role of microRNAs in innate immune signaling</Name><PI>Luke O'neill</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity. This is very much a frontier area since little is known about miRNA function in vivo, and there is still much discovery to be done. Their emerging functions indicate that they are as potent as cytokines in immunoregulation.

We have found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is potently modulated by 2 particular miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-107. The programme will have 4 aspects which will build on this initial observation.
1.	Extension of our observations on miR-21 and TLR signaling. We found that the translational repressor PDCD4 is a key target.  We will study miR-21-deficient mice, construct a mouse model where the miR-21 seed sequence in the 3'UTR of PDCD4 is altered, and target miR-21 in vivo using antagomirs. We will also determine the mRNAs regulated by PDCD4 and examine the role of mTOR in PDCD4 control since PDCD4 is a possible substrate.
2.	Examination of the role of miR-107 in TLR signaling. TLRs dramatically decrease it&#194;&#191;s expression. We have found that miR-107 has an inhibitory role in TNF secretion via the targeting of CDK6. Activation of PPAR-alpha increases expression of miR107, which could be part of the anti-inflammatory effect of PPAR-alpha ligands.  We will explore miR-107-deficient mice and in vitro models of miR-107 function.
3.	Exploring the targeting of miR-155 by IL10, which we have recently found. The miR-155 target SHIP1 may be important in this system.  We will analyze this process in detail and determine other targets for miR-155 in IL10 action.
4.	Perform a screen for novel regulators of the aforementioned miRNAs and screen for miRNAs as regulators of other innate immune pathways, including Nalp3 and RIG-I, about which little is known. These experiments will yield new insights and components

Advances in sequencing technology have revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of microbiota; these advances are not, however, matched by advances in our understanding of the evolutionary factors that structure microbiota. The goal of this proposal is to fill this knowledge gap. Evolutionary models developed for simple host-symbiont relationships have identified a number of factors that shape these relationships: mode of transmission (horizontal versus maternal transmission), host ranges and fitness effects for the host. Together these factors influence the role of selection among hosts and the role of selection within hosts (among microbes), the two levels of selection that are believed to shape host-symbiont coevolution. Here I intend to expand these models to host - microbiota interactions.
My objectives are to use next-generation sequencing to conduct a comparative study of bacterial microbiota structure and to combine this work with experiments that explore the underlying evolutionary processes. I will focus on the crustacean family Daphniidae (mainly the genus Daphnia)&#194;&#191;a system ideally suited for studies in the field and laboratory. I will test hypotheses about the evolution of mutualism, virulence, cheating and coevolution, as well as test for the role of mode of transmission and host specificity. The analysis of host-microbiota associations will be conducted for entire microbiota and for stepwise simplified, but biologically meaningful subsets.
Testing general models for the evolution of microbiota will have implications far beyond the chosen model system, ranging from ecology and evolution to agricultural sciences and medicine. The proposed study is innovative, significant and risk-taking and will combine skills in evolutionary biology, experimental design, bioinformatics and molecular biology.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,446,004</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ModifALS"><Rcn>185430</Rcn><Nid>12358</Nid><HI>Vib, Belgium</HI><Name>From zebrafish to man Modifying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): translation of biology into therapy</Name><PI>Wim Robberecht</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of the motor neurons. As for other neurodegenerative disorders, translation of newly acquired biological insights into therapies has been difficult. In the current project we intend to contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches for ALS. We want to generate novel models, identify new therapeutic targets for intervention, and translate these into validated options for drug development in ALS. This will be done by establishing a continuous line of research from the (unbiased) screening for targets in a small animal model (zebrafish), to the exploration of their therapeutic potential, and the validation in patients. In addition, by exploring the significance of some of the findings for other neurodegenerative disorders, we hope to demonstrate this approach to be valid for the field of neurodegenerative disorders in general. This research will be performed bases on 6 work packages (WP): 1.screening of a zebrafish model for ALS to identify therapeutic targets; 2. validation of these targets in larger vertebrate ALS models; 3. investigation of the mechanism of action of these targets in order to establish approaches to interfere with them; 4. validation of these targets in human ALS; 5. generation of preclinical data on these targets; 6. exploration of the possible role of these targets in other neurodegenerative diseases.

Results from WP1 will be used for further research in WP2, results from WP2 in WP3, etc. We have gathered a large set of data in preparatory work in zebrafish, enabling us to start all WPs from the beginning of the project on.

This project involves collaborations with several other groups, national and international, which all have been established. Furthermore, all transgenic mice needed to initiate all these WPs have been generated and available to us.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,467,990</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MolecMap"><Rcn>102234</Rcn><Nid>11089</Nid><HI>Institute Of Experimental Medicine - Hungarian Academy Of Sciences, Hungary</HI><Name>Quantitative Molecular Map of the Neuronal Surface</Name><PI>Zoltan Jozsef Nusser</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The most fundamental roles of nerve cells are the detection of chemical neurotransmitters to generate synaptic potentials; the summation of these potentials to create their output signals; and the consequent release of their own neurotransmitter molecules.  All of these functions require the orchestrated work of hundreds of molecules targeted to specialized regions of the cells.  In nerve cells, more than in any other cell type, a single molecule could fulfill very different functional roles depending on its subcellular location.  For example, dendritic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels play a role in the integration and plasticity of synaptic inputs, whereas the same channels when concentrated in presynaptic active zones are essential for neurotransmitter release.  Thus, the function of a protein in nerve cells cannot be understood from its expression or lack of it, but its precise subcellular location, density and molecular environment needs to be determined.  The major aim of the present proposal is to create a quantitative molecular map of the surface of hippocampal pyramidal cells (PCs).  We will start by examining voltage-gated ion channels due to their pivotal roles in input summation, output generation and neurotransmitter release.  We will apply high resolution quantitative molecular neuroanatomical techniques to reveal their densities in 19 different axo-somato-dendritic plasma membrane compartments of CA1 PCs.  Functional predictions will be generated using detailed, morphologically realistic multicompartmental PC models with experimentally determined ion channel distributions and densities.  Such predictions will be tested by combining in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology and imaging techniques with correlated light- and electron microscopy.  Our results will provide the first quantitative molecular map of the neuronal surface and will reveal new mechanisms that increase the computational power and the functional diversity of nerve cells.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,446</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MorphoRCE"><Rcn>103578</Rcn><Nid>10597</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>The input of mechanical forces to morphogenesis and wound healing: a systematic dissection</Name><PI>Michel Labouesse</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The importance of mechanical forces in biology is well accepted, yet an integrated view of their mode of action in vivo is lacking. We intend to characterize in-depth the physical forces and cellular processes that coordinate the morphogenesis of different cell types contributing to an organ, taking the C. elegans embryo as a paradigm.
We will achieve this by pursuing three axes:
1.	Building on our discovery of a hemidesmosome-based mechanotransduction pathway that operates between contracting muscles and epidermal cells, we will combine genetic analysis with single-molecule biophysical methods to address three issues. i) What is the primary mechanosensor responding to tension within hemidesmosomes and how does it work? ii) How are all epidermal targets of muscle tension activated? iii) What is the biophysical mechanism stabilizing epidermal cells between muscle contractions?
2.	We will test several features of a finite element model predicting a key role of microtubule-based epidermal stiffness and hydrostatic pressure in elongation. We will combine quantitative mechanical measures with force biosensors and laser ablation to define how these resistive forces contribute to embryo elongation along the anterior-posterior axis.
3.	To extend our conclusions to the medical field, we will knockdown homologues of proteins identified in C. elegans, as well as proteins of the same families, in keratinocytes with partially damaged hemidesmosomes. Cells will be submitted to wound assays or grown on a stretchable substrate. Positive hits will be further characterized and tested in mouse models with partially defective hemidesmosomes.
We foresee that this project will identify conserved proteins and processes relaying mechanical forces, and thus shed light on the mechanical basis of morphogenesis. We also expect our work to have strong impact in medicine, since the outcome of many pathologies, including wound healing and cancer, is thought to be strongly influenced by forces.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,504</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="MotherTongue"><Rcn>98706</Rcn><Nid>12123</Nid><HI>The University Of Reading, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The Evolution of Human Languages</Name><PI>Mark Pagel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Human languages evolve by a process of cultural evolution in which linguistic varieties compete for our attention and adapt to the environment of our minds. This has produced a remarkable cultural replicator whose fidelity of transmission can rival that of some genes. Yet progress in understanding this defining human trait is impeded by an influential view that the processes of linguistic change are so rapid, idiosyncratic and many that general evolutionary rules and laws describing language evolution and language histories will not be found. That perspective can be contrasted with results emerging from recent empirical studies that point to simple and general rules of language evolution that have held throughout human history. This research programme is designed to bridge the gap in these perspectives. Our goal is to build and apply to real-world data, statistical models of linguistic evolution that will put the study of language change on a footing comparable to that of molecular evolution.

Micro-evolutionary studies will formulate and test population-linguistic models of cultural selection acting on words competing within populations of speakers. Macro-evolutionary or comparative studies will build a novel probabilistic model of sound changes and apply it to reconstructing ancestral lexical forms (the proto-language) and language histories. Shared-process studies link these two levels, investigating how common patterns of word-usage and sound changes mediate language evolution around the globe. Our studies are relevant to questions of language competition and extinction and we will investigate how words evolve, reconstruct proto-languages and infer deep linguistic histories -- such as the linguistic settlement of Eurasia, and search for evidence of a Mother Tongue.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,973</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Motor Circuits"><Rcn>94108</Rcn><Nid>13162</Nid><HI>Friedrich Miescher Institute For Biomedical Research, Switzerland</HI><Name>Neuronal circuits controlling motor behavior</Name><PI>Silvia Isabelle Arber</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>How does the assembly of neuronal circuits contribute to the emergence of function controlling dedicated animal behaviors? Finding answers to this question requires a deep understanding of the connectivity map of neuronal circuits controlling a behavior as well as the mechanisms involved in the generation of these specific circuit maps. In the project outlined here, I propose the analysis of the neuronal circuits involved in the generation of motor output, a behavior representing the ultimate output of nearly all nervous system activity. Studying the mouse motor output system will allow the analysis of neuronal circuit connectivity at an exquisite degree of specificity. Owing to the anatomical arrangement of motor neuron pools innervating individual muscles, this system offers the possibility to combine genetic, anatomical and physiological analysis of synaptic specificity with a direct link to a behavioral output. Generation of coordinated motor behavior is functionally linked to the high degree of specificity in presynaptic connections controlling the activation of individual motor neuron pools, yet knowledge on the specificity map of premotor circuits is currently missing. The aim of this research project is to acquire information on the general principles guiding the acquisition, maintenance and developmental plasticity of neuronal connectivity between premotor neurons and functionally defined subpopulations of motor neurons. This project is now possible due to the unique combination of our detailed know-how of the motor system in mice including a variety of genetic animal models, and the application of novel viral circuit tracing technology revealing monosynaptically connected premotor neurons, which we have recently applied successfully to the motor system in mice in vivo.

This complex intercellular junction is specialized for rapid (millisecond) directional signaling.  In addition, synapses change in response to patterns of neural activity and these changes can endure, modifying neuronal circuitry.  These competing properties of persistence and plasticity must be encoded by the precise content and arrangement of molecules that comprise the presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations.   The objective of this project is to uncover the internal organization and dynamics of the postsynaptic specialization at excitatory glutamatergic synapses of the mammalian brain at an unprecedented nano-scale resolution. For this aim, neurobiologists, physicists and chemists join forces in a team with proven track record of collaboration.  We will combine cellular and molecular neurobiology approaches with development of novel optical technologies, biosensors and combined quantitative light and electron microscopic imaging techniques. This will provide a new level of analysis to the fundamental problem of molecular information storage. Photothermal imaging of nano-gold particles will allow unprecedented quantitative histochemistry and tracking of protein trafficking up to the level of intact tissue. Development of Cryo-Photoactivated Light Microscopy will allow the correlative localization of synaptic elements at the light and electron-microscopic level. Novel biosensors and chemical tools will be developed for the investigation of the dynamic macromolecular events underlying synaptic plasticity.

Specifically, the containers will be grafted by Leuprolide (LP) for prostate cancer recognition. Multiple containers will be filled by two drugs (e.g. LP and DOX) in different compartments not interacting with each other chemically (cocktail of drugs, e.g. Container1 Leuprolide (LP) and Container2 Doxorubicin (DOX)). The release can be excited by internal or external stimuli response. The internal stimuli response of our nanocontainers will require simultaneous recognition of pH, redox and/or T of the tumour. The external induction will be caused by RF excitation (hyperthermia). The nanocontainers will identify the tumour first by the agonist (LP). After trapping the container at the tumour, they will be activated by the double and triple internal excitation. This way, we achieve extremely local chemotherapy of the diseased site and the healthy organs will be untouched. Our smart nanocontainers will be tuned for prostate cancer, but our system will be evaluated for other cases such as breast cancer and thrombosis. The containers will be modified (phase transition, volume change, degradation, etc.) and deliver the drug only and if only the two sensors give positive response. The containers can be excited by external induction (Radio Frequency (hyperthermia) RF or laser light). This revolutionary strategy is necessary because the externally induced delivery methods have the disadvantage that the radiofrequency fields, the magnetic fields and the laser lights are not local but they extend over large space, larger than the size of the tumour. One cannot focus from outside the laser beam directly to the tumour only may be due to lack of imaging facilities.

Cyclic peptides are common structural motifs in natural products and medicines (vancomycin, gramicidin). They are widely recognised to constitute a promising and still underexploited class of molecule for novel therapeutics; specifically an important role for cyclic peptides in the inhibition of protein-protein interactions has been demonstrated. We will harness the power of the recently identified macrocyclases from the ribosomally-derived cyanobactin superfamily to prepare diverse modified cyclic peptides. These enzymes exhibit the remarkable ability to macrocyclise unactivated peptide substrates. Different members of this family of macrocyclases process peptides into macrocycles containing from six up to twenty residues. We have characterised and re-engineered one member of the family (PatG) which makes eight residue macrocycles. We will determine the structural and biochemical features of the macrocyclases that are known to lead to six or to twenty residue macrocycles. We will use these insights to put these enzymes to work in novel chemical reactions. We will combine macrocyclases with other enzymes from the cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways (whose structures and mechanism we have largely determined) and work on solid phase peptide substrates. By bringing together the power of solid phase methods (split and pool) and the novel chemistry enabled by the enzymes, we will generate highly diverse macrocyclic scaffolds containing amino acids, enzymatically modified amino acids, non-natural amino acids and non-amino acid building blocks.

However, the increasing variety of mechanisms which reportedly contribute to astroglia-neuron signal exchange is nearing a conceptual bottleneck. How these multiple and diverse mechanisms relate to the functional organisation of astroglia, whether this relationship persists or whether it adapts to neural activity remains poorly understood. Building upon substantial preliminary work and extensive collaboration, our overall objective is to establish principles that guide signal formation, integration and propagation in neural circuits interacting with astroglia. We will focus mainly on hippocampal circuitry and combine single-cell electrophysiology, multi-photon excitation imaging, time-resolved and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, pharmaco- and optogenetic tools and extensive biophysical and neural network modelling. Firstly, we will establish whether and how glia-neuron signal exchange relates to the structure and function of individual synaptic connections represented by postsynaptic dendritic spines and presynaptic axonal boutons. Secondly, we will identify cellular mechanisms by which individual astrocytes integrate, in space and time, calcium signals arising from distinct types of local physiological input. Thirdly, we will determine physiological machinery that prompts use-dependent, meta-plastic changes in the neural circuit-astroglia exchange and in glial signal processing. Fourthly, we will establish the relationship between neural network oscillations and periodic activities of astroglial assemblies.

Genomics, through phylogenomics, will eventually resolve the evolution of macroscopic life, whose phylogeny can be properly modeled in the mathematical image of a bifurcating tree; where the evolutionary process is fundamentally tree-like in nature, we only have to collect enough data to bring the structure of the tree into focus. But when we look back into the evolution of microscopic life and early evolution   that is, prokaryotic evolution, the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition, and the origin of life   genome sequences are only of limited help. That is because neither the evolutionary process linking the evolution of genes across prokaryotic genomes nor the process linking prokaryotes to eukaryotes is strictly tree-like in nature. In prokaryote genome evolution, lateral gene transfer (LGT) is an important mechanism of natural variation, while the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition involved the wholesale merger of prokaryotic genomes via endosymbiosis. This proposal aims to deliver a quantum advance in our understanding of early evolution. Prokaryotic genome evolution and the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition will be investigated with mathematical tools that better approximate the process as it occurs in nature, by using the graph theoretical tools of networks rather than that of trees. For understanding the origin of life, genome data is inapplicable, because genes cannot be compared to inorganic compounds from which life ultimately arose. When it comes to linking microbial life to geochemical processes, the comparison of chemical reaction sequences in living things to those geochemistry is all with which we have to work. Some forms of hydrothermal vents harbour newly discovered chemical reaction sequences with striking overall similarity to that used by methanogens and acetogens, findings that bear upon the nature of the deepest evolutionary divide among modern microbes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,931,280</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEUROCONSC"><Rcn>94707</Rcn><Nid>12973</Nid><HI>Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, France</HI><Name>Converging Criteria for Consciousness: Using neuroimaging methods to characterize subliminal and conscious processing</Name><PI>Stanislas Dehaene</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We aim to find the limits of subliminal information processing and clarify the function and brain architecture underlying conscious processing in adults, infants, patients and non-human primates. (1) We will design experimental tests applicable to non-verbal organisms that can reveal behavioral and cerebral signatures of conscious processing. Those tests, respectively called rule extraction and central collision , each comprise an automatic sensory component and a central component thought to require conscious access. (2) Using these tests, we will identify brain signatures of non-conscious and conscious processing using neuroimaging techniques (ERPs, MEG, fMRI, intracranial recordings) in normal human adults. To validate our approach, we will manipulate stimulus perceptibility (masking), attention (distraction by another task) and vigilance (sleep and anesthesia). (3) We will then extend the approach to brain-damaged adults with coma, persistent vegetative state or minimal consciousness, in order to detect residual processing and to obtain predictors of recovery. We will design computer systems to extract signatures of conscious processing in real time. (4) We will also examine when these signatures first appear in human infancy. (5) Finally, we will measure fMRI activation in monkeys during the same tests, thus allowing for a direct comparison of monkey and human signatures of conscious processing. We will study the effects of anesthesia on the loss of these signatures, and the potential beneficial impact of thalamic stimulation on their restoration. This research will clarify the brain mechanisms of conscious processing, illuminate their ontogeny and phylogeny, and pave the way to clinical intervention studies in patients with impaired consciousness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,640</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEUROGAIN"><Rcn>102564</Rcn><Nid>12140</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Nonlinear synaptic integration in morphologically simple and complex neurons</Name><PI>Robin Angus Silver</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding how neurons represent and transform information and perform the computations required to generate complex behaviours is a core aim of neuroscience. Although this knowledge is of fundamental importance and is a prerequisite for understanding many neuronal disorders, the way in which individual neurons process information is poorly understood. This reflects the technical difficulty of measuring rapid synaptic signalling in fine dendritic structures distributed in 3D space. Moreover, defining the transformation between inputs and output firing is complex due to the large number of input combinations involved. To overcome these problems I have recently developed two powerful new tools. A high speed 3D 2-photon acousto-optic lens (AOL) microscope that enables high speed (30 kHz) 3D optical functional imaging with submicron resolution. I will use AOL microscopy with uncaging, electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches to study synaptic integration in cerebellar granule cells, cortical pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons. Comparison of synaptic integration and neuronal computation in these neurons, which include simple and complex morphologies and excitatory and inhibitory cell types, will allow mechanisms to be investigated and principles identified. By measuring [Ca2+] and voltage at many locations within 3D dendritic trees, I will map the spatiotemporal properties of synaptic input in 3D and locate and count regenerative events.  By applying AOL microscopy, in vitro and in vivo I will elucidate mechanisms and test how information is processed by neurons during sensory input. I have also developed neuroConstruct, a software tool for modelling neurons and large-scale networks in 3D with a high degree of biological detail. By using in vitro and in vivo data to constrain models we will bridge the gap in our understanding between synaptic and neuronal mechanisms and the input-output transformations that morphologically complex neurons perform.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,710</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEUROGROWTH"><Rcn>110441</Rcn><Nid>11945</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Axonuclear Communication in Neuronal Growth Control</Name><PI>Michael Fainzilber</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Neurons exhibit the most marked size differences and diversity in intrinsic growth rates of any class of cells. How then can a neuron coordinate between biosynthesis rates in the soma and the growth needs of different lengths of axons? The central hypothesis of this proposal is that neurons sense the lengths of the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton on an ongoing basis by bidirectional motor-dependent axon-nucleus communication, and that the oscillating retrograde signal generated by this mechanism provides input for the coordinated regulation of neuronal biosynthesis and axonal growth. We will test this hypothesis in a multidisciplinary work program that will characterize and quantify the link between biosynthesis levels and axon outgrowth rates and identify and validate the roles and functions of key molecules underlying this mechanism. This research program will elucidate how neuronal biosynthesis and axon growth are co-regulated.  New mechanistic insights on this fundamental aspect of neuronal cell biology will have far-reaching implications. From the basic science perspective, this work will establish a new modality for encoding spatial information in biological signals, providing a one-dimensional solution to the three-dimensional problem of sensing cell size. Moreover, the proposed mechanism can explain intrinsic limits on regenerative neuronal growth and raises the intriguing possibility of opening new avenues to bypass such limits towards acceleration of axonal growth for effective neural repair.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,040</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEUROSCHEMA"><Rcn>99030</Rcn><Nid>12957</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The neurobiology of schemas: knowledge acquisition and consolidation</Name><PI>Richard Graham Michael Morris</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"This Co-Investigator Application is an interdisciplinary experimental analysis of the neurobiological mechanisms by which we acquire knowledge. Our approach builds on the foundations of contemporary cognitive neuroscience, particularly ideas about the neural mechanisms of declarative memory, and upon recent findings of the participating laboratories (Morris, Fern&#195;&#161;ndez) that have each addressed key issues associated with the rapid acquisition and assimilation of new associative information into existing neural &#194;&#191;schemas&#194;&#191;. Rapid learning depends upon both novelty and prior knowledge. We propose a coordinated program of research concerning the mechanisms of both determinants. First, we will test that novelty, acting via the release of dopamine, has a direct impact on the mechanisms of cellular consolidation in the hippocampus. Second, with respect to prior knowledge, the retention of new event-related associative information requires the process of systems consolidation within declarative memory, as widely studied, but we further suggest that the organisation of knowledge requires more than just stabilising memory traces within neocortical networks. It also involves the integration of distinct memory traces into neural &#194;&#191;schemas&#194;&#191; that, once formed, have a major positive influence on future learning.

The system we use are Drosophila neuroblasts, stem cell like progenitors in the developing fly brain that undergo repeated rounds of asymmetric cell division. During each division, protein determinants called Numb, Prospero and Brat are segregated into one of the daughter cells where they stop self-renewal and ultimately trigger neuronal differentiation. Mutations in those proteins or their segregation machinery lead to the formation of tumor neuroblasts, which proliferate indefinitely leading to the formation of a deadly brain tumor. The approach we take is to determine the transcriptional network that acts in neuroblasts to control self-renewal. We will use time-resolved transcriptional profiling to determine, how this network changes in the differentiating daughter cell and develop tools for medium-throughput functional analysis of the key network players. We will develop methodology for tissue-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine, how the asymmetrically segregating determinants feed into this network. Using this data set, we will determine the pathological state of the network in the tumorigenic situation. We will determine, how wild type neural stem cells limit their proliferation capacity and how those control mechanisms are affected in the tumor situation. Ultimately, we will expand this analysis to other stem cell systems inside and outside the fly nervous system to determine how modifications of stem cell systems like transit amplifying pools or perpetual adult proliferation are reflected in network architecture.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,875</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEXTBINDERS"><Rcn>98916</Rcn><Nid>8712</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>General light triggered switches and sensors for studying proteins inside the cell</Name><PI>Andreas Georg Pl&#195;&#188;ckthun</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The overall objective is to develop general strategies for creating sensors and switches that work inside cells. They will be engineered from Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) as general binding proteins that function inside cells and can be generated against any target by selection and directed evolution. Light-triggered switches will be engineered by placing a LOV domain from phototropin in such a way across the DARPin that it is blocked, and only the light-triggered conformational change makes the DARPin accessible. As a second strategy, DARPins specifically recognizing each one of the two isomers of azobenzene, which can be interconverted by light, will be used within light-dependent cross-linkers. Third, DARPins selected to tightly bind fluorogens, by which these small molecules increase their fluorescence by several orders of magnitude, will be converted into general sensors of the conformation of a target protein working within the cell: large DARPins will be created with overlapping binding sites for the protein of interest and the fluorogen. By using DARPins which can selectively distinguish conformations of the target protein, the conformational changes are made visible in a spatiotemporal manner in an individual cell. As proof of principle, we will generate sensors and switches for the kinase domains of the four ErbB receptors, pivotal in signal transduction in human cancers. To increase the impact of this research further, these novel switches and sensors have to be efficiently brought into cells. For this purpose, adenovirus will be engineered for novel cell tropism, also by using DARPins, to homogenously infect tumor cells to study ErbB signaling and the effect of therapeutics in real time in a receptor-differentiating manner. While tested for the ErbB family as a prototype, the strategies to be developed will be totally general and should open up novel ways of studying signaling within cells in real time and with high spatial resolution."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,158,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NEXTGENMOLECOL"><Rcn>94237</Rcn><Nid>9963</Nid><HI>Uppsala Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Next Generation Molecular Ecology</Name><PI>Hans Ellegren</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>There is an immediate need to increase our understanding of the genetic basis for fitness differences in natural populations (Ellegren and Sheldon Nature 452:169-175, 2008).

Indeed, in the near future ability to recruit very small groups of patients with a potentially novel cancer susceptibility phenotype will be more relevant than ever. Such materials have been resistant to previous gene identification approaches but lend themselves towards success by exomic and whole genome sequencing.
Important discoveries are anticipated in the following fields of research to be conducted under NGG:
1) Identification of rare high-penetrance Mendelian cancer predisposition conditions, and the respective susceptibility genes. One should note that the impact of a gene discovery for basic understanding of key cellular processes is not related to the frequency of the predisposition condition (e.g. RB, LKB1, P53 etc).
2) Identification of moderate penetrance cancer susceptibility genes. Such phenotypes have been difficult to approach with traditional gene identification methods because large pedigrees with multiple affected individuals and few or no phenocopies are not easily identified. Also, the current GWAS approaches are not ideal to detect these loci due to relative rarity of the responsible variants.
3) Characterization of common variants associated with cancer susceptibility."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,483,525</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NGRB"><Rcn>103161</Rcn><Nid>10630</Nid><HI>The Sainsbury Laboratory, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Next generation disease resistance breeding in plants</Name><PI>Sophien Kamoun</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Plant diseases represent a significant threat to global food security. One of the most notorious plant pathogens is the Irish potato famine organism Phytophthora infestans. P. infestans, the causal agent of potato and tomato late blight, continues to cost modern agriculture billions of euros annually. The most sustainable strategy to manage late blight is to breed broad-spectrum disease resistance into potato and tomato. However, current disease resistance breeding approaches are slow, inefficient, and have taken little advantage of emerging knowledge of pathogen mechanisms.

The overall aim of this proposal is to exploit state of the art findings on pathogen effector biology to drive the development of new approaches to breeding disease resistant crops. Our long-term objective is to generate late blight resistant crop varieties. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that mutations in plant resistance and effector target genes can result in broad-spectrum resistance to late blight. The rationale behind this research is based on exciting preliminary data that demonstrated (i) there is a core set of effectors in P. infestans; (ii) plant proteins targeted by P. infestans effectors are important components of the immune response; and (iii) single amino acid changes in a potato resistance protein can result in expanded effector recognition. To achieve our goal, we plan to pursue the following specific objectives:
1. Understand the molecular details of how three P. infestans effectors modulate plant immunity.
2. Generate synthetic plant resistance genes with expanded recognition of P. infestans effectors.
3. Generate synthetic plant effector targets with modified interaction with P. infestans effectors.

The identification of small amounts of fetal DNA in maternal circulation has opened new possibilities for NIPD. Up until today, two methods have achieved accurate and validated NIPD methods for trisomy 21. The first NIPD for trisomy 21 was based on next generation sequencing and the second was developed by our group and is based on a MeDIP real time qPCR. However, nothing has been achieved for the NIPD of other genomic disorders caused by pathogenic copy number changes or mutations. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop, validate and provide to clinical practice a novel NIPD method, which will enable fast, sensitive, accurate, robust and cost effective NIPD of the great majority of genetic disorders caused by either pathogenic copy number changes of genomic segments or single and small size mutations. Initially, biomarkers with differential methylation between fetal and maternal DNA located within the entire human exome will be identified using methylation DNA immunoprecipitation and whole-exome massive parallel sequencing. Then a novel MeDIP exome NGS NIPD method for the great majority (~85%) of genetic disorders will be developed and validated. The method will undergo a blind evaluation study using 300 normal and abnormal maternal peripheral blood samples of pregnant women at 10-12 week of gestation. The intellectual property which may arise will be protected by filing internationally PCT patent(s) followed by dissemination of the results of the project. The new method will not only provide a greater number of highly accurate prenatal diagnoses of genetic disorders, but will do so without any risk for the fetus. Thus, the provision of such prenatal diagnoses may be provided to all pregnant women.

This process is driven by two groups of microorganisms, which oxidize ammonia via nitrite to nitrate. Their activities are of major ecological and economic importance and affect global warming, agriculture, wastewater treatment, and eutrophication. Despite the importance of nitrification for the health of our planet, there are surprisingly large gaps in our fundamental understanding of the microbiology of this process. Nitrifiers are difficult to isolate and thus most of our current knowledge stems from a few cultured model organisms that are hardly representative of the microbes driving nitrification in the environment. The overarching objective of NITRICARE is to close some of these knowledge gaps and obtain a comprehensive basic understanding of the identity, evolution, metabolism and ecological importance of those bacteria and archaea that actually catalyze nitrification in nature. For this purpose innovative single cell technologies like Raman-microspectroscopy, NanoSIMS and single cell genomics will be combined in novel ways and a Raman microfluidic device for high-throughput cell sorting will be developed. Application of these approaches will reveal the evolutionary history and metabolic versatility of uncultured ammonia oxidizing archaea and will provide important insights into their population structure. Furthermore, the proposed experiments will allow us to efficiently search for unknown nitrifiers, evaluate their ecological importance and test the hypothesis that organisms catalyzing both steps of nitrification may exist. For non-model nitrifiers we will develop a unique genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis of key metabolic features. Together, the genomic, metabolic, ecophysiological and genetic data will provide unprecedented insights into the biology of nitrifying microbes and open new conceptual horizons for the study of microbes in their natural environments."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,107</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NOGORISE"><Rcn>102333</Rcn><Nid>11025</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>The Nogo-A receptor complex after CNS injury and its role in the developing and adult nervous system</Name><PI>Martin Ernst Schwab</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Repulsive guidance cues for growing axons and factors inhibiting neurite growth are increasingly recognized as key players for nerve fiber growth and plasticity in the developing and adult nervous system. The first neurite growth inhibitory factor discovered in the context of axonal regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS) was the membrane protein Nogo-A. Inactivation of Nogo-A, e.g. by neutralizing antibodies, after spinal cord injury, brain injury or stroke leads to improved functional recovery in parallel with long distance regeneration of injured fibers and enhanced compensatory sprouting. The molecular mechanisms of action of Nogo-A is only partially known; a key element, the Nogo-A-specific receptor has remained undefined.  We have recently found a membrane protein that binds to Nogo-A with high affinity; blockers of this new receptor neutralize many of the typical Nogo-A effects in vitro. The present proposal addresses new aspects of the mechanism of action and the in vivo roles of this novel Nogo-A receptor and its interactions with the known Nogo receptor components.
The new results will contribute to the molecular and physiological understanding of Nogo-A and related growth inhibitors in the nervous system.

Macrophages display a striking heterogeneity that reflects a complex interplay between different micro-environmental signals provided by various tissues (as well as by microbial and endogenous stress signals), and a robust differentiation program that determines macrophage identity.
Terminal differentiation depends on the implementation of cell type-specific gene expression programs driven by fate-determining transcription factors (TF). However, the intermediate events linking lineage-specific TFs to the acquisition of the 1- and 3-dimensional genomic organization characteristic of a given cell type (and essential to configure its specific properties and its ability to properly react to the environment) are largely unknown.
The objective of this project is to understand how macrophage identity, functional specialization and plasticity are controlled by their specialized genomic organization, which is encoded in mammalian genomes, controlled by specific TFs, and modulated by the microenvironment. By integrating cutting-edge biochemical and genomic techniques, genetics in the mouse, computational approaches and equilibrium thermodynamics, the project aims at describing, and mechanistically deciphering, the specific organization and usage of the genome that is characteristic of macrophages and underlies the acquisition of their functional properties.

The TCR acts in a monovalent fashion is crosslinked by its antigen/MHC (pMHC) ligand, causing TCR triggering. However, our more recent data indicate that the TCR is organized in pre-existing oligomers, and therefore it might not require crosslinking, and that the triggered TCR adopts, upon ligand binding, an active conformation that is responsible for recruiting cytoplasmic effector molecules. We have found novel direct effectors of the TCR, including the Ras GTPase TC21 and unveiled that these effectors play an essential role in a variety of TCR signaling functions including tonic signaling and TCR downregulation. Furthermore, we have found that TC21 is required for the acquisition of pMHC by T cells from the APCs and re-express it on their own plasma membrane, becoming themselves APCs for other T cells. In this proposal we wish to explore several of the avenues open by our most recent findings, including the importance of pMHC presentation by T cells. Another objective is to study an interesting property of the conformational change in the TCR: its return to the inactive conformation even when it is still bound to its pMHC ligand (countdown effect). We also propose to use approaches that alter the size of pre-existing TCR oligomers to seek for new ways of modulating T cell activation. The last two objectives refer to study the role of TC21 as a direct effector of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). We propose to study the involvement of TC21 in the B cell germinal center response and how the deregulation of its expression can influence the transformation of GC B cells into lymphomas.

As no crystals of ribosomes from pathogens are available, we have initiated crystallographic studies, and present here preliminary results on two pathogenic life threatening bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (associated with MRSA resistance) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis via Mycobacterium smegmatis that serve as its medical diagnostic tool. We also aim at experimentally defining the intra-ribosome region suggested by us to be a vestige of a prebiotic apparatus (proto-ribosome) by designing autonomous molecular entities with catalytic capabilities. Constructs the bind substrates have already been obtained. The expected enhancement in understanding peptide bond formation should lead to novel insights into this universal essential process. Our studies are designed to provide unprecedentedly powerful new tools for minimizing pathogens resistance thus should be of immense therapeutic relevance &amp; will open up new horizons for researchers seeking response to challenges of the increasing antibiotic resistance.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,487,989</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Near-infrared probes"><Rcn>192381</Rcn><Nid>13469</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Near-infrared fluorescent probes based on bacterial phytochromes for in vivo imaging</Name><PI>Vladislav Verkhusha</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Non-invasive monitoring of deep-tissue developmental, metabolic and pathogenic processes will advance modern biology. Imaging of live mammals using fluorescent probes is more feasible within the near-infrared (NIR) transparency window (NIRW: 650-900 nm) where hemoglobin and melanin absorbance significantly decreases, and water absorbance is still low. The most red-shifted fluorescent proteins (FPs) of the GFP-like family exhibit fluorescence outside of the NIRW and suffer from low brightness and modest photostability. Natural bacterial phytochrome photoreceptors (BphPs) utilize low molecular weight biliverdin as a chromophore and provide many advantages over other chromophore binding proteins. First, unlike the chromophores of non-bacterial phytochromes, biliverdin is ubiquitous in mammals. This makes BphP applications in mammalian cells, tissues and mammals as easy as conventional GFP-like FPs, without supplying chromophore through an external solution. Second, BphPs exhibit NIR absorbance and fluorescence, which are red-shifted relative to that of any other phytochromes, and lie within the NIRW. This makes BphPs spectrally complementary to GFP-like FPs and available optogenetic tools. Third, independent domain architecture and conformational changes upon biliverdin photoisomerization make BphPs attractive templates to design various photoactivatable probes. Based on the analysis of the photochemistry and structural changes of BphPs we plan to develop three new types of the BphP-based probes. These include bright and spectrally resolvable permanently fluorescent NIRFPs, NIRFPs photoswitchable either irreversibly or repeatedly with non-phototoxic NIR light, and NIR reporters and biosensors. The resulting NIR probes will extend fluorescence imaging methods to deep-tissue in vivo macroscopy including multicolor cell and tissue labeling, cell photoactivation and tracking, detection of enzymatic activities and protein interactions in mammalian tissues and whole animals.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,946</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Neural renewal"><Rcn>99289</Rcn><Nid>11842</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>Neurogenesis in the adult human brain</Name><PI>Jonas Kristoffer Fris&#195;&#169;n</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the characteristics of the central nervous system is its plasticity, with for example a remarkable capacity to store new information. It was for long time thought that there was very little plasticity in terms of exchanging cells and that we essentially were limited to the neurons we were born with. It is now well established that new neurons are added to certain regions of the adult brain in most mammals, although it has been very difficult to study in humans.
The proposed project aims to unveil the cell lineage producing new neurons in the adult human brain and to assess the extent of neurogenesis and how it may change in for example aging and neurological and psychiatric diseases. We propose to take advantage of the rapid development of sequencing technology to assess the origin and lineage of new cells in the human brain by phylogenetic fate mapping. This will be combined with the analysis of the turnover of neurons in the adult human brain by a retrospective birth dating methodology which we recently have developed based on the integration of nuclear bomb test derived 14C. This is a cross-disciplinary project that bridges from basic cell and molecular biology, latest generation DNA sequencing technology via clinical medicine and mathematical modeling to nuclear physics.
A possible role for alterations in adult neurogenesis in the etiology of both depression and schizophrenia has recently received much interest. However, the link between neurogenesis and psychiatric diseases is based on a series of indirect indications, mainly in experimental animals. It is pivotal to gain direct information on the relationship between neurogenesis and psychiatric and neurological diseases in humans.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,491,235</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Neuro-behavior"><Rcn>89273</Rcn><Nid>8997</Nid><HI>Humboldt-Universitaet Zu Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>From Neuron to Behavior</Name><PI>Michael Brecht</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In the present proposal I will describe a novel research agenda for understanding the neural basis of mammalian behavior.  Three central problems prevent current research from explaining mammalian behavior in terms of neural mechanisms. First, there is a preponderance of correlative evidence in systems neuroscience. Second there is generally insufficient information about the individual neuron(s) under study. Third, there is a lack of integration of information. Current neuroscience is characterized by strongly diverging research interests and this highly divergent and specialized research program cannot lead to systemic understanding of brain function.  We will confront these problems by three novel research approaches: (1) We will establish a causal link between cellular activity and behavior by a single-cell-stimulation / reverse physiology approach. (2) We will obtain rich information about single neurons by whole-cell recordings in awake behaving animals. (3) We will perform a whole-brain-analysis of a novel model organism, the Etruscan shrew, in which we will record the activity of all neurons in the shrew s brain.  The research proposed here is unique, because as no other research group investigates brain function by a single-cell-stimulation, by intracellular recordings in freely moving animals, or by whole-brain analysis. The research outlined here will probe the relationship of neural activity and behavior in an entirely unprecedented fashion.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Neuronal dynamics"><Rcn>102025</Rcn><Nid>11928</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Dynamics of local transcriptomes and proteomes in neurons</Name><PI>Erin Margaret Schuman</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The ability of the nervous system to respond adaptively relies on modifications to existing proteins as well as changes in gene transcription and protein translation. An individual neuron in the brain possesses approximately 10.000 synapses, many of which are hundreds of microns away from the cell body. As many of the changes to environmental stimuli occur at synapses, the question arises as to how the modified synapses gain access to the new mRNAs and proteins. It is now clear that synapses possess the capacity for local protein synthesis, owing to the localization of ribosomes and mRNAs within dendrites. Previous studies have identified a relative small number of localized mRNAs and an even smaller number of locally synthesized proteins. We hypothesize that synaptic plasticity makes use of the local pool of mRNAs and newly synthesized proteins to alter its&#226;&#128;&#153; function. Here we propose to discover the identity of nearly all the mRNAs that are localized, &#226;&#128;&#156;the local transcriptome&#226;&#128;&#157;, using the deep RNA sequencing technology. Using a new high-resolution platform that makes use of &#226;&#128;&#156;fluorescent barcodes&#226;&#128;&#157; we will visualize individual mRNAs and quantify their abundance in the dendrites. We will also discover the proteins that are synthesized in dendrites, &#226;&#128;&#156;the local proteome&#226;&#128;&#157;, using a novel chemical tagging strategy that we developed. In this approach, we can identify proteins synthesized within a given cell-type (e.g. neurons), via the expression of mutant tRNA synthetase in a restricted cell population. We will then examine how plasticity sculpts the local mRNA and protein population, as we hypothesize that both the transcriptome and the proteome are dynamically regulated by ongoing synaptic events.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,402,134</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NeuronsInMotion"><Rcn>99444</Rcn><Nid>9257</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>Linking glutamatergic spinal cord and brainstem neuronal circuits to the control of locomotor behavior</Name><PI>Ole Kiehn</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Locomotion is an essential motor act that for the most part is controlled by neuronal circuits in the spinal cord itself, called central pattern generators (CPGs), although their activity is turned on from centers in the brainstem. Understanding the operation of CPG circuits in mammals has been a significant challenge to neuroscientists over the last 50 years. The CPG for walking generates rhythm, as well as the precise patterns of muscular activity. The neural assembly that is directly involved in generating the locomotor rhythm is completely unknown. There is strong evidence from pharmacological and lesion studies showing that glutamatergic neurons are responsible for this function. Here, I propose to identify these key glutamatergic neuronal CPG circuits. As a first step we will use state-of-the-art RNA-sequencing to obtain the complete transcriptome of glutamatergic subpopulations in the ventral spinal cord of the mouse to define new postnatally expressed molecular markers. To link glutamatergic neuronal subpopulations to the locomotor behavior we will use transgenic mouse systems to incorporate light-activated switches in a cell specific way. These tools will provide a new basis for functional and network studies needed to understand the CPG operation. We also propose to use mouse models with optogenetic switches to provide a molecular identification of the glutamatergic locomotor command systems and their integration in the CPG. Our analysis will provide a unified characterization of the neuronal organization of the mammalian CPG and its immediate control from the brain. Understanding the locomotor CPG and its control in mammals is of outmost importance for improving rehabilitation of spinal cord injured patients and designing new repair strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NewGenes"><Rcn>106865</Rcn><Nid>12881</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>The role of de novo evolution in the emergence of new genes</Name><PI>Klaus Diethard Tautz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Gene evolution has long been thought to be driven primarily by duplication or transposition mechanisms, followed by divergence of the duplicated copy. However, every evolutionary lineage harbours also so-called orphan genes, which have no homologues in other evolutionary lineages i.e. which do not appear to have arisen via gene duplication mechanisms, or have diverged to a point where their origins can not be traced anymore.  Orphan genes are generally thought to be important drivers of taxon specific adaptations and interactions with the environment. New insights from comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis suggests now that orphan genes could indeed be created through de novo evolution and it is becoming increasingly clear that this mechanism might occur at high rates, which would provide a continuous source of material for new gene functions. However, only initial evidence is available for this so far and little is known about the evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of de novo gene emergence. The present proposal will use experimental and functional approaches to study the role and the evolutionary potential of the emergence of completely new genes from random sequences. This will open up new perspectives in understanding the evolution of genomes and the molecular mechanisms of adaptation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Novel Anaerobes"><Rcn>107883</Rcn><Nid>11627</Nid><HI>Wageningen University, Netherlands</HI><Name>Novel anaerobes for a biobased economy</Name><PI>Alfons Johannes Maria Stams</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Our current society depends on many natural resources, and the availability of these natural resources (minerals, fossil fuels) is becoming more and more limited. The challenge of a sustainable and biobased economy is to develop innovative technologies to recover and reuse minerals and energy-rich compounds from waste streams and non-food agricultural crops. Microorganisms can be exploited for biotechnological purposes.

The aim of this project is to study novel anaerobic microorganisms that:
1.  Degrade and grow with biopolymers (polysaccharides and lipids),
2.  Produce high value products (succinate and long chain fatty acids),
3.  Possess a metabolism that can be steered by hydrogen and/or electricity.

Microbial diversity represents an enormous reservoir of novel catalysts that can be exploited for a biobased economy. Molecular ecological research has shown that the majority (&gt; 95 %) of the microorganisms in Nature has not yet been cultured and characterized. Their function in geochemical cycles is unknown and their biotechnological potential unexploited. This also applies for methanogenic environments in which organic matter is converted to methane and carbon dioxide, via energy rich organic intermediates. Our understanding of the microbial interactions that take place in methane formation is still scarce, especially how fermentations are influenced by hydrogen. In methanogenic environments fermentative anaerobes are present that produce valuable organic compounds, which should be exploited.

Novel anaerobes can be isolated by intelligent and innovative isolation approaches, such as the MicroDish method. This method is currently adapted in my group for high throughput screening of strict anaerobes. The genomes of selected strains will be sequenced, followed by proteomics to obtain insight into their physiology to optimize the formation of valuable compounds. Such novel anaerobes will become the pillars of new biotechnological activities in Europe.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,592</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="NucEnv"><Rcn>107287</Rcn><Nid>9543</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Nuclear Envelope Biogenesis, Function and Dynamics</Name><PI>Ulrike Kutay</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The nuclear envelope (NE) harbors key roles in cellular and organismal homeostasis, reflected by a variety of diseases caused by mutations in NE proteins. Despite the fundamental role of the NE in protecting and organizing the genome, still little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying NE biogenesis, dynamics and functionality. We will address 3 open questions in NE biology, using vertebrate cells as model system. (1) To understand how the functional specification of the NE by transmembrane proteins is generated, we will decipher how membrane proteins are sorted to the inner nuclear membrane (INM). To reach this goal, we will define targeting signals and the mode of NPC passage of INM proteins, and identify the molecular requirements for transport. (2) Based on structural analysis, we will investigate how the molecular organization of LINC complexes, which are formed by interacting pairs of SUN and KASH proteins spanning the NE, determines their role in NE architecture and as tethers of the NE to the cytoskeleton. (3) We will study dynamic changes of the NE that occur at the onset of &#226;&#128;&#153;open&#226;&#128;&#153; mitosis, when the nuclear compartment is disintegrated to allow for the formation of a cytoplasmic mitotic spindle. NE breakdown (NEBD) presents a dramatic change of cellular architecture and comprises a series of events including disassembly of nuclear pore complexes, the nuclear lamina and retraction of NE membranes into the endoplasmic reticulum. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling and executing these steps of nuclear disassembly, we will characterize the cellular machinery involved in NEBD and unravel the molecular function of identified components. All these questions will be addressed by a blend of in vivo approaches relying on high-end fluorescence imaging linked to computational image analysis, RNAi screening, as well as powerful in vitro systems recapitulating protein transport to the INM or NEBD that we have developed, and biochemical methods.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Nuclear Calcium"><Rcn>89778</Rcn><Nid>12859</Nid><HI>Ruprecht-Karls-Universit&#195;&#164;t Heidelberg, Germany</HI><Name>The biology of nuclear calcium: general principles of adaptations and strategies to develop a light-induced signaling enhancer</Name><PI>Hilmar Bading</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Adaptation is a characteristic of life. Changes in gene expression allow cells and organisms to transform signals from the environment into long-lasting adaptive responses that range from learning and memory, addiction and chronic pain, to immunity and plant-microbe symbiosis. The project is based on the idea that the rules and signals governing the rich repertoire of adaptations are simple and used nearly universally. The research program consequently follows the concept that persistent adaptations take place when calcium   a widely used modulator of cell functions   enters the cell nucleus to activate transcription. In the nervous system, nuclear calcium controls CREB-mediated transcription following synaptic activity and is required for memory and activity-dependent survival. Dysfunction of nuclear calcium signaling may lead to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. We propose to develop methods for in vivo visualization of nuclear calcium signals in awake animals performing learning tasks and to establish, using key examples of adaptive responses, nuclear calcium a an evolutionary conserved regulator of adaptations. On the basis of common principles governing adaptive responses it becomes possible to develop general strategies to modulate adaptations irrespective of cell type or phylogenetic borders. At the heart of the proposal is the development of the proto-type of a nuclear calcium signaling enhancer. We exploit the optical properties of channelrhodopsin and aequorin to construct a light-induced signaling enhancer to boost physiological nuclear calcium responses and to restore them in disease or aging. The proposal has a focus on neuroscience and aims to provide proof-of-principle for unconventional treatments of neurodegenerations and age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the  nuclear calcium concept  is applied to immunology and plant biology to devise means of modulating immune responses and increasing plant growth by boosting symbiosis signaling.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,400,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Nutri-CARE"><Rcn>108082</Rcn><Nid>12884</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>Nutri-CARE: Nutrient restriction during Critical illness: from induction of Autophagy to Repression of aberrant Epigenetic alterations</Name><PI>Greta Herman A Van Den Berghe</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Modern intensive care medicine enables survival from previously lethal conditions. Risk of death is mostly attributable to lack of recovery from organ failure. Although intensive care has been practiced for over 6 decades, the understanding of why certain patients recover and others don&#226;&#128;&#153;t remains very limited. Furthermore, organs and tissues from patients who do not swiftly recover, do not show overt signs of cell death but instead accumulate damaged organelles and protein aggregates and reprogram towards other cell lineages. Accumulation of cell damage can be compared with what occurs during ageing, but much more pronounced and within a much shorter time.  Even when patients survive, many continue to suffer from severe morbidity, referred to as the legacy of critical illness. This indicates that acute life-threatening illnesses, and/or the intensive care management, induce &#226;&#128;&#156;carry-over&#226;&#128;&#157; effects with long-term consequences with important humane and financial implications. We recently showed that nutrient restriction early during critical illness is an intervention that affects these processes. Nutrient restriction unexpectedly accelerated recovery from organ failure and enhanced rehabilitation far beyond the time window of the intervention. These data radically contradict the traditional dogma that early anabolism is required for recovery from critical illnesses. Also, they raise the hypothesis that pathways which are activated by fasting play a key role. This project is designed to understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of the damage-induced &#226;&#128;&#156;reprogramming&#226;&#128;&#157; and the benefit of nutrient restriction, which is essential in order to develop novel preventive and therapeutic interventions. We hypothesize that activated autophagy and repressed deleterious epigenetic alterations play a major role. The results of these studies are expected to pave the way towards novel effective interventions to prevent/treat the debilitating legacy of critical illness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OMVac"><Rcn>188508</Rcn><Nid>11591</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Trento, Italy</HI><Name>Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from &#226;&#128;&#156;Vaccinobacter&#226;&#128;&#157;: A Synthetic Biology approach for effective vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer</Name><PI>Guido Grandi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal intends to apply Synthetic Biology to create a new bacterial species, Vaccinobacter, devoted to the production of multivalent, highly effective vaccines. The project originates from the evidence that Outer membrane Vesicles (OMVs) naturally produced by all Gram-negative bacteria can induce remarkable protective immunity, a property already exploited to develop anti-Neisseria vaccines now available for human use. OMV protection is mediated by the abundance of Pathogen-Associated-Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), known to play a key role in stimulating innate immunity. Moreover, OMVs can be engineered by delivering recombinant proteins to bacterial periplasm and outer membrane. Intrinsic adjuvanticity and propensity to be manipulated potentially make OMVs an ideal vaccine platform, particularly indicated when antigen combinations (for pathogens with genetic variability) and strong potentiation of immunity (for the elderly and cancer) are needed. However, full exploitation of OMVs as vaccines is prevented by:  i) presence of potentially reactogenic compounds such as LPS, virulence factors, and toxins, ii) presence of several irrelevant proteins, which dilute immune responses, iii) lack of broadly applicable molecular tools to load OMVs with foreign antigens. Scope of the project is to provide novel solutions to solve these limitations and demonstrate the unique performance OMVs as vaccines by testing them on complex pathogens and cancer. Main project activities are: 1) remodelling of E. coli genome to create &#226;&#128;&#156;Vaccinobacter&#226;&#128;&#157;, a &#226;&#128;&#156;living factory&#226;&#128;&#157; of OMVs deprived of all unnecessary components but carrying the relevant immune potentiators, 2) characterization and optimization of the immune stimulatory properties of OMVs,  3) development of novel methods to incorporate foreign antigens into Vaccinobacter-derived OMVs, 4) loading of OMVs with selected pathogen- and cancer-derived antigens and demonstration of their protective efficacy in appropriate animal models.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,612,828</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ONCOLYTIC-HERPES"><Rcn>185420</Rcn><Nid>11960</Nid><HI>Alma Mater Studiorum - Universita Di Bologna, Italy</HI><Name>ONCOLYTIC HERPESVIRUSES RETARGETED TO CANCER- SPECIFIC RECEPTORS</Name><PI>Maria Gabriella Campadelli</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Cancer remains a major health burden worldwide. The aggressive targeting of metabolic pathways shared by normal and cancer cells results in prolonged survival and cures, but at a tremendous cost to patient life quality. What is missing is a therapeutic agent that clearly differentiates normal and cancer cells. This proposal delineates a process for killing exclusively cancer cells with no interference with normal cells. In the past two decades there has been considerable effort to develop attenuated viruses for killing cancer cells. Of the oncolytic viruses in clinical trials, attenuated herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are among the most promising because of safety, affinity for cancer cells, ability to treat patients multiple times without block by adaptive immunity. The shortcoming is that they do not discriminate between normal and cancer cells, are effective in a limited number of patients. The remarkable accomplishment by my laboratory at the basis of the proposal is the genetic engineering of HSVs that specifically infect and kill cancer cells and cannot infect normal cells. The prototype retargeted HSV targets HER2, a receptor in breast, ovary and other tumors. HER2-HSV ablates human breast and ovary cancers, and glioblastoma after intratumoral or intraperitoneal administration.

If detected early, surgical removal of RCC can be curative but the prognosis for metastatic disease is very poor. RCC is resistant to conventional therapy and recently introduced targeted therapies form the mainstay of treatment for metastatic disease. The rationale for the use of targeted therapies (e.g. antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors) in RCC was derived from functional investigations of the mechanism of tumourigenesis in the rare inherited RCC syndrome von Hippel-Lindau disease. Whilst currently available targeted therapies can extend progression free survival in advanced RCC they are not curative and better treatments are urgently required. Large scale genomic studies of RCC are in progress and will greatly enhance current knowledge of the molecular pathology of RCC. However, experience from other cancers suggests that the results of genomic analyses of cancer are complex and identifying the key &#226;&#128;&#156;gatekeeper genes&#226;&#128;&#157; is frequently challenging. ONCOTREAT is based on the hypothesis that (a) the identification of the genetic basis of inherited forms of RCC will highlight those genes and pathways that are critical for tumourigenesis and (b) that selective targeting of cells deficient in inherited RCC gene function will enable advances in the treatment of inherited and sporadic RCC.
The objectives of ONCOTREAT are to:
1.	Identify novel inherited RCC genes
2.	Generate and characterise human cell line models for inherited RCC genes
3.	Identify candidate therapeutic agents that, in in vitro studies, selectively target human cell line models of inherited RCC genes dysfunction

Cancer vaccination has activity but is only moderately effective.  My ERC Advanced Award will use novel translational approaches to take a  highly novel vaccine strategy which is excellent in mouse models towards a clinical vaccine for prostate cancer patients.

We have developed a novel strategy for anti-prostate cancer vaccination based on the expression of cDNA libraries in viral vectors.  Using vesicular stomatitis virus and prostate and melanoma derived libraries, this is curative in mice and we have established its mechanisms and the key antigenic determinants (Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology).  We now have to translate this radically new vaccine strategy to the clinic.  My ERC Award will be used to develop the vaccine strategy in an adenovirus vector, optimise viral constructs for optimal immunological effect and evaluate these in mouse prostate cancer and human in vitro immune systems.  I hypothesised that in the clinic, the emergence of resistant populations of tumour cells from heterogeneous human cancers is likely to be a key factor in clinical failure.  We will study resistant and recurrent tumours in mice using immunological and proteomic approaches to tumours and plasma in order to identify potential mechanisms of resistance to the vaccine, and potential blood protein biomarkers of resistance, which will allow us to incorporate strategies to avoid resistance in our clinical programme.

The key features of this model are that oncogenes induce DNA replication stress, which in turn leads to DNA double-strand breaks, genomic instability and p53-induced senescence or apoptosis. This model is relevant for almost all cancer types and explains the spectrum of mutations being reported in thousands of human cancers by the cancer sequencing consortia.
In this project, I propose to take the next logical steps that follow from my discovery. Specifically, I propose the following objectives:
1. Elucidate the mechanisms by which oncogenes induce DNA replication stress. Oncogene-induced genomic deletions map within very large actively transcribed genes. Accordingly, I hypothesize that oncogenes and transcription synergistically disrupt pre-replicative complexes resulting in large genomic regions that have a low density of replication initiation events. To test this hypothesis, I propose to introduce by site-directed homologous recombination a transcription termination sequence at the beginning of very large gene and determine whether it remains sensitive to oncogene-induced genomic instability. Genome-wide transcription and DNA replication patterns will also be examined in cells that are sensitive to oncogene-induced DNA replication stress (most somatic cells and cell lines) and cells that are resistant (induced pluripotent stem cells).
2. Identify and characterize genes necessary for proliferation of cells with oncogene-induced DNA replication stress. Using high throughput siRNA screens we will identify genes, whose depletion inhibits proliferation of cells with oncogene-induced DNA replication stress, without affecting normal cells. We will explore the function of these genes using molecular biology, structural biology and genetic approaches. Some promising candidates have already been identified."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,351</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OPAL"><Rcn>94131</Rcn><Nid>9811</Nid><HI>University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom</HI><Name>"Origins, proliferation and pathogenesis of L-form (cell wall deficient) bacteria"</Name><PI>Jeffery Errington</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Jeff Errington is a bacterial molecular cell biologist with nearly 30 years of research experience. He spent much of the first 15 years or so working on spore formation in B. subtilis as a simple model for development and differentiation. His lab developed a method with which to clone the complete set of sporulation genes and then contributed in a major way to working out how sporulation is controlled spatially and temporally. Work on the spatial control of gene expression and protein localization led him to pioneer some of the methods of digital imaging of bacteria on which the modern field of bacterial cell biology was founded. He has contributed in a major way to understanding the division machinery of bacterial cells and particularly how division is restricted to the correct mid cell position. Errington made the seminal discovery that bacteria have true homologues of actin (MreB proteins) and showed that MreB filaments govern cell shape by directly organising the cell wall synthetic machinery. Recent work has opened up the neglected field of L-form bacteria to molecular and cellular analysis by developing methods to study the L-form state in a controlled way in B. subtilis. Errington has promoted the commercialization of the basic science emerging from his lab through foundation of a spin-out company Prolysis Ltd, which has developed the first cell division inhibitors with proven efficacy. Errington has founded the new Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology in Newcastle, to promote the recovery of basic science on model bacterial cells and has recruited several world leading experts to the Centre. Over his career he has helped train nearly 50 graduate students and post-docs, many of whom have gone on to become independent group leaders.

Moreover, an in vitro system for vacuole fusion exists and we recently succeeded in reconstituting also cell-free vacuole fission with purified organelles.  We will first build an experimental toolkit for vacuole fission to characterize this reaction in detail. Several approaches will be combined: (1) Identification of fission proteins by mutant screening, as well as by candidate approaches, and their localization relative to the fission site; (2) further developing a system reconstituting in vitro fission and efficient methods to quantitate it. (3) creating  organelle chips  to synchronously study fission on multiple single vacuoles immobilized in a defined orientation. (4) time-resolved confocal microscopy of fission proteins in vivo and in vitro; (5) biochemical characterization of fission protein associations and their changes during fission. These approaches will identify the vacuolar fission apparatus and help to elucidate its functioning.   In a second step we will explore how the fission apparatus physically and functionally interacts with the   already well-defined   vacuolar membrane fusion machinery. We will characterize the impact of cell cycle regulators and signaling pathways on these interactions. These studies will be pioneering in that they will lead us to a comprehensive description of an organelle fission process and of how membrane fission and fusion components are coordinated to control size and copy number of an organelle.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,310,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ORGENECHOICE"><Rcn>94203</Rcn><Nid>9775</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Regulation of the expression of odorant receptor genes in mouse</Name><PI>Peter Mombaerts</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Odorant receptor (OR) genes form the largest family in the mouse genome: ~1200 genes spread over ~40 loci. Each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses one OR gene, from one allele. The mechanisms of OR gene choice remain elusive. We will execute five specific aims that are interconnected but independent. We will search for homeodomain genes that we can link functionally to expression of a subset of OR genes; we will define promoter regions for the eight OR genes that are solitary, not belonging to a cluster; we will look for organizational principles among the repertoire of second choices in OSNs that express first an OR locus without a coding sequence; we will characterize the phenotype of mice with a knockout of a novel regulatory element, the P element; and we will test the distance-dependence of the activity of this and a similar element (the H region) by transplanting it within the local genomic region. Guiding hypotheses are that promoter regions for OR genes are short and close to the coding sequence; that the conserved homeodomain and O/E binding sites in OR promoter regions have a fundamental role in OR gene choice, rather than in transcription after it is chosen for expression; and that the H and P elements are two of several similar regulatory elements that each operate in cis within a cluster. The approach is based on gene targeting and transgenesis by pronuclear injection. A multipronged strategy will be taken to assay OR gene expression, with &#206;&#178;gal-reporter mice, in situ hybridization, custom Affymetrix microarrays for mouse ORs, quantitative, real-time PCR, and Nanostring molecular bar codes.

We believe that, in eukaryotes, a differential encoding of chromosomes by DNA replication origins is instrumental for the acquisition of cell identity during development. We wish to decipher this encoding, to determine whether it is linked to gene expression, and identify the mechanisms used to build a replication origin. First, we will unravel the origins code in mouse undifferentiated pluripotent cells with a genome-wide approach and correlate the replication origins' map with other chromosomal genetic or epigenetic features. The origins code will be deciphered also in the same cells when engaged into a specific (neural) differentiation. We predict that this differential mapping will identify constitutive and regulated origins, the latter specific to gene domains expressed in differentiation and providing cell identity. In the second axis of this project, we will identify proteins that constitute a replication origin. We will exploit two novel screening procedures developed in our laboratory. The "chromosome-trap" assay uses DNA beads to collect factors assembling at replication origins, using Xenopus cell-free systems. The "Replication foci capture" method allows the isolation of replication origins at their in-situ chromosomal location. Key objective 1: to unravel DNA replication origins' code in pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Key objective 2: to identify a link between replication origins and cell identity . Key objective 3: to investigate whether replication origins are responsible for the spatio-temporal organization and cell identity regulation by Homeobox domains.

My group has recently identified 2 causative antigens (neutral endopeptidase and bovine serum albumin) in children, and 2 predisposing genes HLA-DQA1 and PLA2R1 coding for another antigen in adult MN. However, MN is most likely more complex, involving several antigen-antibody systems and immune response genes. To get a comprehensive view of self and food/environmental antigenic targets and of HLA and non-HLA trigger genes, and to design new rapidly acting therapies, I will develop novel technological approaches such as immunopeptidomics, and explore new pathophysiological and therapeutic concepts with 3 major objectives:
1. Identify the immune response targets (epitopes) using unbiased approaches such as HLA-class II peptidomics, random peptide libraries, and sequencing of candidate genes starting with PLA2R1
2. Investigate trigger genes by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the HLA-D locus and of other genes involved in autoimmunity and disease progression, in 150 pairs of donors and recipients with or without recurrence of MN, a situation offering a unique opportunity to analyze effects of genetic background
3. Revisit complement-related innate immunity by NGS sequencing of 18 complement regulatory protein genes in search of variants which may account for disease heterogeneity, by blocking C5b-9 formation with recombinant factor H in 2 murine models of MN, and by searching for C5b-9 antagonists by high-throughput screening of chemical libraries in podocyte cell-based assays.
Our project will provide new biomarkers that will be used to set up reliable tests for diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of outcome and recurrence of MN.

Anti-HER2 therapies including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab) and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (lapatinib) are active and have improved survival of patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer. However, the emergence of primary or acquired resistance to these agents limits their efficacy. We have previously identified mechanisms of resistance to anti-HER2 therapies such as the co-expression of a truncated form of HER2 that correlates with trastuzumab resistance or the presence of downstream oncogenic mutations of PI3K or PTEN loss that result in resistance to lapatinib . Not surprisingly, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors overcome lapatinib resistance in the later example. Building on our results to date, this proposal is aimed at identifying novel mechanisms of resistance to anti-HER2 agents and to devise therapeutic strategies to revert it. To uncover such mechanisms, we have generated cancer cells with acquired resistance to lapatinib or trastuzumab by continuous exposure to increasing concentrations of these agents. We will perform genome wide screens, including shRNA libraries, gene expression and SNPs arrays, to discover candidate genes responsible for decreased sensitivity to anti-HER2 agents. To overcome anti-HER2 therapy resistance we will study several therapeutic strategies, such as combinations of different anti-HER2 compounds and the use of alternative agents targeting downstream/parallel pathways. Among the novel targeted therapies, we plan to study the use of PI3K, Akt, CDK2 and Hsp90 inhibitors, for which we will also start resistance-screens. It is anticipated that any promising preclinical leads will stimulate trial design and conduct for subsequent evaluation and confirmation in the clinic."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,666,700</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="OVOC"><Rcn>91078</Rcn><Nid>13085</Nid><HI>Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Germany</HI><Name>Ultra Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging using One-Voxel-One-Coil Acquisition</Name><PI>J&#195;&#188;rgen Hennig</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The proposal is aimed at the development of ultrafast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for applications in neuroscience, neurology and oncology. The methodology used is based on the principle of one-voxel-one-coil acquisition in which the sensitive volumes of arrays containing a large number of small receiver coils is used as primary source of spatial localization. This allows to achieve acquisition speed &gt;&gt; 10 fps and opens up new windows of application for MRI. Within this proposal research will be aimed at two areas of application: For investigation of fast physiological events in the brain, applications based on the observation of fast spatiotemporal events by MR-encephalography (MREG) will be developed. MREG will be used for detailed quantitative measurement of differential cortical response during activation of cortical networks by complex stimuli. Primary areas of interest will be the investigation of spatiotemporal response in visual perception, visual and auditory cued tasks and during language processing. In addition to quantitative mapping of response, map functional connectivity with and without correlation with ECG will be investigated.  For neurological applications we will use the very high sensitivity of MREG to detect arterial pulsatility in order to generate quantitative, three-dimensional maps of hemodynamic function. Clinical applications for examination of patients with stroke, ischemia, vascular disease and vascular pathologies will be developed. The principles of OVOC-measurements will also be applied in oncology for measurements of fast intrinsic and stimulated physiological events like dynamic measurements of blood flow, tissue permeability and oxygenation in tumors and metastasis. Spectroscopic OVOC-measurements will be developed to observe metabolic turnover.  All experiments will be performed both in humans and animal models. Highly localized experiments will be performed using microcoil arrays currently under development.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Oculus"><Rcn>107669</Rcn><Nid>13183</Nid><HI>The Provost, Fellows, Foundation Scholars &amp; The Other Members Of Board Of The College Of The Holy &amp; Undivided Trinity Of Queen Elizabeth Near Dublin, Ireland</HI><Name>A radical approach for improved glaucoma treatment</Name><PI>Peter Humphries</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Open angle glaucoma (OAG) is the second leading cause of world blindness. Treatments involving topically applied pressure-reducing medications or surgery targeting ocular drainage channels are effective, although significant complications exist. We propose to address the hypothesis that it is possible to develop a radical approach to management of intraocular pressure employing an AAV-mediated system for increasing the permeability of Schlemm&#226;&#128;&#153;s canal endothelial cells (SCEC), based on published supportive data from this laboratory showing that RNAi-mediated down regulation of mRNA encoding components of tight junctions of neuronal vascular endothelia induces increased cell permeability, a process which has been used to validate a procedure for acute treatment of neuronal edema. While tight junctions of neuronal vascular endothelial cells have been extensively studied and comprise of a series of up to 30 protein components, less is known of the organization of adherence mechanisms of SCEC, although electron- and immunofluorescence microscopy show the presence of tight junctions. We propose a comprehensive analysis of tight junction protein expression in SCEC in vitro.  In vivo studies will involve introduction of AAV vectors into the anterior chamber of the eye in rodent models of elevated IOP.  The vectors will be designed to express shRNAs targeting a variety of tight junction transcripts expressed in SCEC using an inducible system. The effect of RNAi-mediated increase in the permeability of SCEC will be assessed using aqueous humour outflow measurement methods and we will also explore the utility of high resolution and diffusion-weighted MRI for this purpose, which may prove to be a simpler, non-invasive and clinically relevant method. This research will provide further fundamental insights into the mechanisms of ocular pressure maintenance and could provide benefit to those patients not responsive to conventional means of therapy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,838</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Oncogenomics"><Rcn>94300</Rcn><Nid>9829</Nid><HI>University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Development of high throughput in vivo oncogenomic screening strategies in acute leukaemia</Name><PI>Christine Britch</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Within a highly successful research environment, we will develop a state-of the-art high throughput functional in vivo oncogenicity assay, using mouse bone marrow transplant models of leukaemia to conclusively identify the important genetic changes involved in the development and progression of cancer. This study will focus on B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), for which there is a wealth of knowledge on the biology of the disease. Our aim will be to differentiate between driver and passenger genes, when other techniques have implicated large numbers of candidates. Initial areas of focus will be 1) to determine the gene(s) involved in patients with the poor risk subtype of ALL, iAMP21, so that these may be specifically targeted by molecular therapy. This is important to reduce the high level of toxic treatment required to prevent relapse in these patients; 2) to definitively identify tumour suppressor genes within the deleted region of chromosome 6. Patients with this abnormality comprise a high proportion of ALL and non Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL), particularly childhood T-lineage NHL, where it is linked to a poor prognosis; 3) to identify and characterise those genes involved in drug resistance leading to relapse. Candidate tumour suppressor genes associated with relapse have already been implicated. Comprehensive sequencing of further samples will identify additional mutated genes. The ultimate aim is to determine the clinical relevance of these abnormalities and develop molecular genetic assays suitable for routine clinical detection, with a view to validating their role as molecular targets for therapy; a particular strength of my group.

Nowhere is this limitation more profound than in our understanding of cancers, diseases that arise in the main through genetic accidents in established adult tissues and in which defining the ongoing roles of specific genes in maintenance of established tumours is crucial for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention.

For example, we know that the origin of species must involve genetic separation, most often followed by phenotypic differentiation. Geographic isolation and subsequent genetic separation gives rise to the uncontroversial allopatric mode of speciation. But in theory, populations can become genetically separated without geographical isolation, resulting in the more disputed sympatric mode of speciation. Recently, Savolainen (the applicant of this proposal) and colleagues provided strong evidence for sympatric speciation in a case study of two species of Howea palms on Lord Howe Island, Australia. Here, we will take our research to a much deeper level and tackle novel themes. Innovative approaches will be developed, combining field ecology and genetic modelling, and taking advantage of the most recent advances in genomic technologies such as ultra-high throughput sequencing provided by the Roche 454 and Illumina Solexa platforms. Using Howea as a model system, sequences of their transcriptomes, scans of their genomes and genes expression profiles, we will test the theoretical predictions that only a few genetic loci controlling key traits are necessary for rapid ecological speciation. Extending this study to other taxa and islands, we will ask what combinations of ecological conditions and genomic architectures lead to the evolution of new species? Particularly, how can species originate in the face of gene flow, for example when confined to a minute oceanic island? The project will provide one of the most comprehensive studies of speciation and has the potential to provide a drastically new perspective on this process. It will also shed light on the wide-ranging link between genotype and phenotype, as well as help to manage biodiversity in a sustainable manner.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,415,470</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="P53LAZARUS"><Rcn>99238</Rcn><Nid>13167</Nid><HI>The Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Tumour suppressor p53: structure, stability and novel anti-cancer drug development</Name><PI>Alan Fersht</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Elimination of the tumour suppression activities of p53 is common to all cancers. p53 is inactivated directly by mutation in ~50% of human cancers, and ~30-40% of these oncogenic mutants are just temperature sensitive, ts, being active at lower temperatures. Wild-type p53 spontaneously denatures, with a half-life of 10-20 minutes at body temperature, and ts mutants far faster. The melting temperature and half life of ts oncogenic mutants can be raised by small molecules. The mutant Y220C is particularly propitious for study and as a target for therapy as the mutation makes a druggable cavity. We discovered lead compounds for a novel class of anti-cancer drugs that could be used to treat 70-80,000 new cases of cancer per annum worldwide via reactivating Y220C. I present a programme to understand the basic principles of stabilising Y220C in particular and the thermodynamics and kinetics of ts mutant proteins in general. Such studies may aid the development of lead compounds for reactivating Y220C into prospective drugs and will act as a paradigm for development of the &#194;&#191;holy grail&#194;&#191; of a generic p53-reactivating drug.

I will investigate the biophysical and structural characteristics of how to stabilize proteins by small molecules using the leads thrown up by the drug-screening programme.

Neural plasticity constitutes a key element of pathological pain, which can come about over various anatomical and temporal scales. Apart from functional plasticity, tremendous potential exists for changes in the structure, connectivity and representation of pain, which can account for long-term persistence of pathological pain. This grant aims to study structural plasticity processes in the somatosensory nociceptive system, test their functional significance and address underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, a topic not adequately studied so far owing to technical constraints.
On the background of our established repertoire of mouse models for chronic pain and transgenic/viral gene delivery/RNA interference approaches for molecular manipulations, two key complementary methodologies will be employed to visualize and modify structural plasticity, namely non-invasive multiphoton in vivo imaging and optogenetic reversible modulation of neuronal activity in vivo, respectively. We will dynamically study sprouting, regeneration and rewiring of sensory nerves over the progression of neuropathic and tumor-evoked pain and image invasion of tumor cells into nerves. Moreover, we will directly image remodelling of synaptic contacts in brain regions processing pain. Importantly, the impact of structural changes on function will be studied by measuring pain behavior concurrently in the same animals and via targeted molecular interventions. Secondly, optogenetic activation and reversible silencing of nociceptors or specific areas in the brain in vivo will be used to directly measure peripheral and central contributions to plasticity and chronic pain behavior.

Despite these hostile conditions, most soda lakes are highly productive and harbor diverse microbial communities responsible for the cycling of chemical elements. The sulfur cycle, driven by haloalkaliphilic sulfur oxidizing bacteria and sulfidogenic bacteria, is one of the most active element cycles in soda lakes. In general, extreme environments are characterized by a low diversity of life. However, we have isolated more than 100 strains of sulfur bacteria from different soda lakes worldwide and detected additional uncultured diversity using molecular techniques. Because life at high salinities and high pH is extremely energy demanding, the enormous diversity of sulfur bacteria in this extreme habitat is a great paradox. The overall goal of the project is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and ecophysiology of sulfur bacteria in soda lakes, their niche differentiation, and the molecular mechanisms by which they adapt to extreme halo-alkaline conditions. To achieve this goal, the sulfur bacteria will be studied at the molecular, population and community level, and with a systems biology approach, combining incubation experiments under well-defined conditions, state-of-the-art &#226;&#128;&#152;omics&#226;&#128;&#153; techniques, and mathematical modeling. This project will unravel the paradox of the sulfur bacteria in soda lakes, which is not only important for a comprehensive understanding of the success of life under extreme conditions, but also for the use of these bacteria in the sustainable removal of noxious sulfur compounds from our waste streams, which is essential for a clean and healthy environment."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,242,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PARIS"><Rcn>110414</Rcn><Nid>10219</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>PHYSICIAN AIDED RECONSTITUTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</Name><PI>Herman Waldmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Unwanted immune responses to self-tissues and transplants have a major impact on human health and wealth. Their management has required long-term immunosuppressive drugs which penalise the whole immune system. The big challenge has been to understand how the individual is naturally tolerant to self, and to exploit this knowledge for treatments better targeted to the relevant antigens. Since 1980 the applicant&#226;&#128;&#153;s laboratory  have, in rodent models, defined mechanisms of acquired tolerance, and used monoclonal  antibodies to transiently block lymphocyte function, or deplete  lymphocytes with the goal  of establishing  tolerance therapeutically.  This led to the discovery of &#226;&#128;&#157;infectious tolerance&#226;&#128;&#157; where tolerance was shown to require  regulatory CD4+FoxP3+ T cells. Although efficacious in rodent models, equivalent blockading   antibodies for man, although available, have not been commercialised by the pharmaceutical industry.  To deplete lymphocytes in man, our laboratory has also developed the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, CAMPATH-1H. This was the first humanised therapeutic antibody (Alemtuzumab/Lemtrada) and is being  actively pursued for  multiple sclerosis and stem cell and organ transplantation.  Although lymphocyte depletion has clearly proven to be clinically useful, it has not, when used alone, permitted tolerance to transplanted organs or allowed for durable immune reprogramming in autoimmune disease.   This proposal seeks to understand how to build on the benefits of lymphocyte depletion with CAMPATH-1H,  and promote tolerance by exploiting tolerance&#226;&#128;&#147;promoting mechanisms learned from our studies of  co-receptor/co-stimulation blockade. The novel approach taken by this project is to investigate and manipulate the reconstitution phase of lymphocyte recovery through Physician Aided Reconstitution of the Immune System (PARIS), by aiming to contain those T-cells that mediate damage whilst empowering competing regulatory T-cells."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,905</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PATHFINDER"><Rcn>100675</Rcn><Nid>11125</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Mimicking pathogens; an integrated nano-medicine approach to developing intelligent cancer vaccines</Name><PI>Carl Gustav Figdor</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Tumour cells survive and grow because they are not effectively recognized by the immune system as &#194;&#191;foreign&#194;&#191; and are therefore not attacked and destroyed like most pathogens. We have already demonstrated the clinical value of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines that activate the immune system to fight cancer. Treating more than 300 patients with metastatic melanoma, we achieved extended survival in 40% of patients by maturing dendritic cells from the patient&#194;&#191;s blood in-vitro, loading them with cancer-specific antigens and re-injecting them into the patient. These DCs then activate tumour-specific T cells in the lymph nodes. Our success in this area of research makes us a world leader in dendritic cell immunotherapy. However, despite these encouraging results, more work needs to be done if this type of therapy is to move into routine cancer care.

Therefore the primary objective of the research detailed in this proposal is to significantly enhance cancer treatment efficacy by developing multifunctional nano-sized vaccine carriers that specifically target DCs and T cells in-vivo. If successful, this will also eliminate the costly in-vitro steps associated with current dendritic cell therapy.

The recent discovery of pathogen recognition receptors on dendritic cells opens up the possibility of exploiting these receptors to target dendritic cells within the body. We will therefore develop highly functionalized, slow-release vaccine carriers that target DCs in this way. In order to directly activate tumour-specific T cells, we will develop highly flexible polyisocyanide polymers that mimic naturally occurring DCs. To functionalize these polymers, we aim to develop a revolutionary DNA-based bar-coding technique.
I expect this new approach leads to major advances in tumour immunotherapy."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,680</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PBDR"><Rcn>99462</Rcn><Nid>9874</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>The population biology of drug resistance: Key principles for a more sustainable use of drugs</Name><PI>Lukas Sebastian Bonhoeffer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The evolution of drug resistance and its control represents a considerable challenge in very different biological contexts ranging from pesticide resistance in agriculture to antimicrobial resistance in clinical settings and even extends beyond infectious pathogens, as resistance also evolves in cancer chemotherapy. Naturally, the recommendations for the optimal use of drugs to minimise resistance differ for different biological contexts. In some cases, similar strategies for vastly different pathogens or biological contexts are recommended, whereas in other cases opposing strategies for similar pathogens are advised. To which extent these discrepancies in treatment recommendations are attributable to specific properties of the pathogen, the host, or the general biological context is currently unclear. The aim of this proposal is to develop an integrative population biological framework for the evolution of resistance and its control. To this end we will develop mathematical models of resistance evolution in viruses, bacteria, parasites, cancer and fungal plant pathogens. Developing detailed population biological models that account for the specific biology of these &#194;&#191;pathogens&#194;&#191; as well as the specific context of the application of drugs will allow us to identify those aspects that are common between different biological contexts and those aspects that are specific to the pathogen, the host or the drug.

This project will make substantial advances in all three areas, using birds (mainly zebra finch) as model organisms. (i) Sperm size and shape: A major hypothesis for the enormous variation across species in the design of male gametes is that a trade-off exists between sperm size and number. We will test this, by estimating (for the first time) the energetic costs of making sperm. (ii) Sperm-female and sperm-egg interactions. We will establish, how sperm from different males interact within a female and will do this, uniquely, by using transgenic zebra finches whose sperm flagella are labelled with green fluorescent protein (GFP). This allows us to distinguish (in the oviduct and in ova) the sperm from GFP- and normal males and to visualise how they interact to generate last male sperm precedence. (iii) The genetic and environmental causes of embryo mortality. We will explore the environmental effects of temperature on embryo development and survival and consider the special case of brood parasites that expose their ova to elevated temperatures through &#194;&#191;internal incubation&#194;&#191;.

This resistance mechanism is currently a fundamental process that will be increasing substantially with further development of specific molecular targets. The main ideas are based on state of the art methodologies recently developed in our laboratory capable of describing these processes. PELE, our novel technology based on protein structure prediction algorithms and a Monte Carlo sampling, is capable of describing the all atom dynamical interaction between a protein and a ligand.

With its billions of neurons and innumerable connections, the brain is of such complex nature, that trying to understand it may seem a vain project. Yet, by using the &#226;&#128;&#152;mini-brain&#226;&#128;&#153; of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, which shares many components with the human brain but counts only 302 neurons, thorough research can penetrate into this complexity. We here pursue to deliver a much-needed understanding of how learning and memory processes are regulated by neuropeptide signaling in the brain. Neuropeptides are small regulatory proteins that are implicated in a variety of processes. Growing evidence exists for their involvement in learning and memory, but how they exert these effects is largely unexplored. In C. elegans we recently disentangled a conserved vasopressin/ocytocin-related system that &#226;&#128;&#147;as in humans&#226;&#128;&#147; mediates associative learning. As such, we can deliver the experience, model and logical approach to provide detailed insights in neuropeptidergic control of learning and memory. We will first identify the endogenous ligand of all orphan C. elegans neuropeptide GPCRs, as this will provide the essential basis to build this project on. Mutants of neuropeptide-receptor pairs will then be tested for their ability to learn or maintain associative short- or long-term memory. We will also define in which cells and circuits relevant neuropeptides and receptors are needed for these functions, in order to generate models of neuropeptidergic control of learning and memory. We envisage the use of novel tools and cutting-edge experimental setups to take this research beyond its current horizon. Via single cell RNA sequencing, optogenetic analyses and in vivo calcium imaging, we will develop a workflow to build integrative models of associative learning and memory processes mediated by neuropeptides, which will serve as a scaffold for the study of these processes in more complex brains."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,463,028</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PERSIST"><Rcn>103343</Rcn><Nid>10620</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Bacterial Persistence</Name><PI>Kenn Gerdes</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Almost all bacterial species generate persisters, individual cells that are tolerant to antibiotics. Persisters have entered a dormant or slow growing state in which they are recalcitrant to the killing activity of most known antibiotics. The molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial persistence are unknown and there is a pressing need to develop new methods and approaches to study the phenomenon. We discovered recently that RNA endonucleases (RNases) encoded by toxin - antitoxin (TA) genes are required for persistence of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We have shown that the RNases inhibit translation by cleavage of mRNA or tRNA and that their activation halts cell growth and induces persistence. We propose a testable model in which persistence is induced by stochastic activation of the RNases. Almost all free-living bacteria, including many serious pathogens, have TA genes, often in multiple or even many copies. For example, the major pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can persist in the human body for many years, has at least 88 TA loci. This proposal describes a research program dedicated to develop novel general methods to study the persistence phenomenon and to test the hypothesis that TA loci are central to bacterial persistence. The implementation of novel, leading edge technologies will allow a profound understanding of the persistence phenomenon. Mechanistic insight into the persistence problem, in turn, will provide a basis for a rational approach to the development of drugs and drug administration regimes that may improve treatment of persistent infections."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,455,110</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PHAGORISC"><Rcn>185395</Rcn><Nid>11977</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Connecting RNA and protein degradation machineries</Name><PI>Pascal Genschik</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>RNA silencing has become a major focus of molecular research around the world with important implications in biotechnology and medicine. RNA silencing involves processing of dsRNA by the enzyme Dicer, into small RNAs, 21-to-25 nucleotides in length. One of the two RNA strands is then incorporated into a protein complex called RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) that invariably contains a member of the highly conserved ARGONAUTE protein family. The incorporated small RNA then guides the complex to silence partly or fully complementary RNA. RNA silencing is important for the regulation of development in animals and plants, but plays also an antiviral role in plants and invertebrates (including worms and flies). In light of the apparent importance of RNA silencing in most eukaryotes, it is surprising that molecular mechanisms regulating ARGONAUTE proteins (and RISC) turnover have received so little attention. For instance, it is unknown whether ARGONAUTE proteins remain very stable when incorporated in RISC and how many times they can operate on different mRNA targets while loaded with the same siRNA/miRNA. More importantly, intriguing questions concern ARGONAUTE protein turnover under stress conditions. For instance, it is unknown whether ARGONAUTE proteins (and RISC) are degraded during stress, a situation where siRNA/miRNA populations quickly change and RISC re-programming is expected. My research project aims to answer to these questions. The content of this program is multidisciplinary combining molecular and cell biology, genetics, biochemistry and structural biology. Based on its approaches and already pioneering data recently obtained in my lab, I believe that this ERC research project has the potential to go substantially beyond the current state of the art in this field by providing deep insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control and mediate ARGONAUTE proteins turnover, in particular during stress responses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,492,623</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PI3K-III complex"><Rcn>93331</Rcn><Nid>9374</Nid><HI>Universitetet I Oslo, Norway</HI><Name>The PI3K-III complex: Function in cell regulation and tumour suppression</Name><PI>Harald Alfred Stenmark</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Phosphoinositides (PIs), phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), control cellular functions through recruitment of cytosolic proteins to specific membranes. Among the kinases involved in PI generation, the PI3K-III complex, which catalyzes conversion of PtdIns into PtdIns 3-phosphate (PI3P), is of great interest for several reasons. Firstly, it is required for three topologically related membrane involution processes - the biogenesis of multivesicular endosomes, autophagy, and cytokinesis. Secondly, through its catalytic product this protein complex mediates anti-apoptotic and antiproliferative signalling. Thirdly, several subunits of the PI3K-III complex are known tumour suppressors, making the PI3K-III complex a possible target for cancer therapy and diagnostics. This proposal aims to undertake a systematic analysis of the PI3K-III complex and its functions, and the following key questions will be addressed: How is the PI3K-III complex recruited to specific membranes? How does it control membrane involution and signal transduction? By which mechanisms do subunits of this protein complex serve as tumour suppressors? The project will be divided into seven subprojects, which include (1) characterization of the PI3K-III complex, (2) detection of the PI3K-III product PI3P in cells and tissues, (3) the function of the PI3K-III complex in downregulation of growth factor receptors, (4) the function of the PI3K-III complex in autophagy, (5) the function of the PI3K-III complex in cytokinesis, (6) the function of the PI3K-III complex in cell signalling, and (7) dissecting the tumour suppressor activities of the PI3K-III complex. The analyses will range from protein biochemistry to development of novel imaging probes, siRNA screens for novel PI3P effectors, functional characterization of PI3K-III subunits and PI3P effectors in cell culture models, and tumour suppressor analyses in novel Drosophila models.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,272,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PICHO"><Rcn>103815</Rcn><Nid>10527</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>p53 control of epithelial homeostasis</Name><PI>Yinon Ben Neriah</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Background: Our recent studies implicate p53 in gut tissue homeostasis - suppressing epithelial invasion. This function is tightly linked to suppression of a gene cluster (PSIS- p53-Suppressed Invasiveness Signature), which requires Wnt activation and other cues, yet is only expressed upon loss of p53. The invasive signature explains a broad spectrum of the invasiveness property, from the loss of enterocyte polarity to matrix degradation, pointing to a concerted action. We documented a tight association between invasiveness and coexpression of several PSIS genes in different mouse models and showed that PSIS expression is essential in mediating epithelial cell invasiveness following p53 depletion.
Goal: Elucidate functions of p53 activation which are of particular importance for epithelial tissues. Understand how WT p53 contributes to preserving epithelial boundaries, prohibiting invasion and abnormal cell mixture and controlling stem cell dynamics under tissue stress.
Methodology: We will investigate the epithelial role of p53 and the invasive signature genes in several mouse models of inflammatory bowel diseases and intestinal cancer. These models will incorporate p53-modulating switchable genetic elements and cell-tracking genetic markers for monitoring tissue dynamics. Analyses of relevant human pathology samples will complement the mouse studies.
Significance: Invasion is a defining hallmark of malignancy and understanding early invasion of tumor cells is of fundamental importance in designing future therapies for cancer - targeting PSIS is an example. PSIS database may also be used to develop biomarkers for distinguishing malignant tumors from benign ones, a critical determinant of therapeutic options in several types of cancers, currently solely based on morphologic assessment. A molecular definition of early invasive lesions may allow early implementation of curative treatments while withholding patient overtreatment which often results in serious morbidity.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PIDIMMUN"><Rcn>94706</Rcn><Nid>13042</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Primary immunodeficiency diseases as models for the study of the immune system</Name><PI>Alain Fischer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The study of primary immunodeficiency diseases has provided significant insights into how the immune system works. This notably includes in vivo immune responses to microorganisms, pathogens or opportunistic agents and in vivo control of reactivity to self, in relation to the identification of specific gene mutations. Hence, some of the key factors of the immune system have been unraveled. In this respect, studies in human conditions are essential because (i) they provide truly natural models of the immune system at work and (ii) because there are many known differences between the human and murine immune systems. Detailed investigations of newly described phenotypes and further delineation of known phenotypes which lack associated gene mutations represent as many new models for studying multiple facets of the human immune system. Appropriate in vitro and in vivo experimental models will be designed in order to gain a detailed understanding of newly identified molecules. It is also expected that the elucidation of immune system pathways will have an impact on therapeutic research. This proposal has been generated by a group of scientists with expertise in both fundamental and clinical research and aims at tackling some of these multifaceted questions. These studies will benefit from the well-characterized cohorts of patients with specific primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) that have been constituted over the years. The project has 3 major subheadings: 1) Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) of DNA repair pathways, 2) PIDs of lymphocyte cytotoxicity/cell death pathways; 3) Therapeutics for primary immunodeficiencies. Scientists who take part in the project will address these various topics as a function of their respective fields of expertise.

Most escape mechanisms rely on the successive expression of members of gene families in a mutually exclusive manner, a biological process which remains elusive at the molecular level. The protozoan pathogen Plasmodium falciparum, which infects up to 300 million people causing more than two million lives each year, undergoes antigenic variation to establish chronic blood stage infection. A critical determinant in chronic infection and pathogenesis is the expression of clonally variant molecules at the surface of infected erythrocytes. Several variant gene families undergo antigenic variation in P. falciparum and are expressed during blood stage infection. One family encoded by 60 var genes expresses the most well-known virulence factor causing severe malaria (capillary blockages in the brain and other organs mediated by infected erythrocytes). Switching expression between the 60-member var gene family avoids immune clearance and prolongs the period of infection and transmission to the mosquito. The initial event controlling mono allelic expression at a unique expression site remains elusive and represents the Holly Graal in the field of phenotypic variation. To this end, the major objective of this proposal is to identify specific factors contributing to active expression sites (proteins, DNA enhancer or ncRNA) by using novel strategies such as Proteomics of Isolated Chromatin segments (PICh) and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C). We expect that new insights into the underlying principles of gene counting of virulence gene families may reveal an Achilles Heel of the parasite s immune evasion strategy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,815,480</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PLASTINHIB"><Rcn>108083</Rcn><Nid>12906</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale (Inserm), France</HI><Name>Molecular Plasticity of Inhibitory Synapses</Name><PI>Antoine Triller</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Neurons maintain a precise organization of their membrane into sub-domains with specific molecular compositions, together with the capacity to change it in response to plasticity events. However, as seen with the tracking of single molecules, receptors in the plasma membrane continuously exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic locations. Interactions between neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic scaffold proteins control the distribution of receptors at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. This mechanism is modulated at many levels, and contributes to the regulation of the synaptic strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in physiological and pathological conditions. This project will address the gap in knowledge between the molecular instability of randomly diffusing receptors and the stable functional architecture of synapses. It will provide new insights into fundamental issues related to the cellular basis of neuronal information processing. Focusing on inhibitory Glycine and GABAA receptors (GlyR, GABAAR) I will have 3 main objectives:
Objective 1: to determine key aspects of the relationship between the synapse microstructure, molecular dynamics, and molecular interactions.
Objective 2: characterize the mechanisms by which receptor diffusion contributes to the adaptation of inhibitory synapses to excitatory activity.
Objective 3: understand how non-neuronal glial cells modulate inhibitory receptor diffusion-trapping and ultimately impact on neuronal excitability.
For this research, single molecule methods and super-resolution microscopy give access to molecular dynamics (tracking), the morphology at high resolution, and quantitative data such as dwell times and absolute numbers of molecules, thus identifying new cellular mechanisms accounting for the regulation of inhibitory synaptic strength."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,429,640</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PNET"><Rcn>110615</Rcn><Nid>10194</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Principles of biomolecular networks</Name><PI>Naama Barkai</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Cells process information using biochemical circuits of interacting proteins and genes. We wish to define principles guiding the design of those circuits. The interplay between variability and robustness is of key interest to us. Bio-molecular processes are stochastic, environmental conditions fluctuate, and sequence polymorphisms are abundant. How is variability buffered to maintain reproducible outcomes? Can variability enhance computational abilities? What is the impact of variability on bio-molecular circuit design? We will explore those fundamental questions in three contexts:
Source of variability in Gene expression: We previously examined the mechanistic basis of expression variability, defining promoter structures associated with low vs. high variability. We will now address the more challenging question: what evolutionary pressures shape the expression program? On the network level, we will define mutual effects of selection for increased expression and for optimal growth. On the metabolic level, we will define which aspect of the expression process is limiting and the genomic consequences of this limitation.
Role of expression variability in Nutrient homeostasis: We recently reported that repression of high affinity transporter in rich nutrient (the &#226;&#128;&#152;dual-transporter&#226;&#128;&#153; motif) enables advanced preparation to nutrient depletion. We will now validate an additional predicted property of this motif: cells become committed to the starvation program, escaping it due to expression noise only. To this end, we will introduce a novel method for modulating expression noise while maintaining mean abundance.
Buffering variability in Embryonic patterning: Buffering fluctuations is essential in embryonic patterning. We previously established that the embryonic DV axis of Drosophila is robustly patterned through the newly defined shuttling mechanism. We will quantify the ability of this system to buffer size variations (scaling), and reveal the underlying scaling mechanism.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,311,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="POL1PIC"><Rcn>111070</Rcn><Nid>10138</Nid><HI>European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany</HI><Name>Dynamic architecture of the RNA polymerase I transcription initiation machinery</Name><PI>Christoph M&#195;&#188;ller</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>RNA polymerase (Pol) I and Pol III synthesize non-translated RNAs including rRNA, 5S RNA, and tRNAs for ribosome assembly and protein synthesis.

We propose to study the structure and dynamics of the Pol I transcription initiation machinery in a broad and interdisciplinary analysis that combines an integrated structural biology approach with in vitro and in vivo functional analysis, proteomics approaches, integrative modelling and fluorescence microscopy studies. The project builds on our on-going efforts in studying Pol III transcription and first results in the analysis of Pol I transcription, where crystals of the 14-subunit Pol I enzyme diffracting to at least 3.5 &#195;&#133; resolution have been obtained.

Structural data combined with results from chemical cross-linking and biochemical interaction assays will be used for integrative modeling of the structure and dynamics of Pol I PICs. Fluorescence (cross-) correlation spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) will monitor Pol I PIC assembly in vivo. Structural information will direct the site-specific fluorescence labeling of Pol I PIC components to monitor conformational changes during Pol I PIC assembly and transcription in vitro. Our results will provide comprehensive, structural, and mechanistic insights into Pol I transcription and the possible role of Pol I in cancer.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,459,090</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="POLYTRUE?"><Rcn>106936</Rcn><Nid>12885</Nid><HI>University Of Leeds, United Kingdom</HI><Name>What is the mechanism of the true chronic effect of dietary polyphenols?</Name><PI>Gary Williamson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Although there have been many epidemiological and intervention studies on polyphenol-rich foods showing promising effects in reducing the risk of heart disease and diabetes, the true mechanisms of action remain elusive. In vitro systems to study nutritional mechanisms are limited by several factors and most have been derived from acute studies relevant to pharmaceutical research. In order to determine the chronic and true mechanisms of effects of dietary polyphenols that occur in the body as a result of diet, a paradigm shift in thinking is needed in the design of in vitro experiments. Based on human bioavailability data, I propose to develop suitable systems for the chronic study of polyphenols, and test these with the metabolites actually formed according to data from in vivo studies. The disparity between in vitro and in vivo studies will be bridged by the development of multi-cell type and engineered cells, overcoming some of the limitations of cell culture experiments. Based on these cells, chronic exposure to the main classes of polyphenols and metabolites, as found in blood, will be conducted using appropriate time scales and measuring relevant biomarkers. The groundbreaking nature will be to discover how polyphenols are actually working in the long term, more equivalent to lifetime exposure to foods. The experimental approach is designed to test the hypothesis that the exposure of cells to chronic low levels of metabolites, relevant to real nutrition, will have significant and different effects to those observed at acute high concentrations. This will finally provide the elusive explanation for the protective effects of polyphenol rich foods in epidemiological studies. The project involves a unique mixture of in vivo and in vitro experiments, the result of which will disconnect the inappropriate reliance of nutritional bioactive compound research on pharmaceutical thinking, and set the conduct of diet-relevant experiments on a new and more realistic path."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,065</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="POPFULL"><Rcn>89300</Rcn><Nid>11217</Nid><HI>Universiteit Antwerpen, Belgium</HI><Name>System analysis of a bio-energy plantation: full greenhouse gas balance and energy accounting</Name><PI>Reinhart J.M.

Among the different alternatives of bio-energy production the use of biomass crops such as fast-growing woody crops under short rotation coppice (SRC) regimes - is probably the most suited, in particular in the EU. Two issues need to be addressed before the efficacy of bio-energy for carbon mitigation can be conclusively assessed, i.e. (i) a full life cycle analysis (LCA) of the global warming contribution of SRC, and (ii) and an assessment of the energy efficiency of the system. The objectives of this project are: (i) to make a full LCA balance of the most important greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, H2O and O3)  and of the volatile organic compounds (VOC s), and (ii) to make a full energy accounting of a SRC plantation with fast-growing trees. The project will involve both an experimental approach at a representative field site in Belgium and a modelling part. For the experimental approach a SRC of poplar (Populus) will be monitored during the course of 1+3 years, harvested and transformed into bio-energy. Eddy covariance techniques will be used to monitor net fluxes of all greenhouse gases and VOC's, in combination with common assessments of biomass pools (incl. soil) and fluxes. For the energy accounting we will use life cycle analysis and energy efficiency assessments over the entire life cycle of the SRC plantation until the production of electricity and heat. A significant process based modeling component will integrate the collected knowledge on the greenhouse gas and energy balances toward predictions and simulations of the net reduction of fossil greenhouse gas emissions (avoided emissions) of SRC over different rotation cycles, global warming scenarios, and management strategies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="POSTTRANS"><Rcn>106953</Rcn><Nid>9123</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>An interdisciplinary genome-wide study of posttranscriptional regulation by small RNAs: from individual interactions to networks and evolution</Name><PI>Hanah Margalit</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Deciphering the interactions within and between the three major components of living organisms, DNA, RNA and Protein, is at the heart of biological research.  New large-scale experimental methods have dramatically advanced genome-wide detection of protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-mediated RNA-RNA interactions. However, at present there is no large-scale method that could detect all RNA-RNA interactions independent of a mediator protein, or when the mediator protein is unknown.  Attaining such a method is of utmost importance and is very timely, as it is now evident that RNA-RNA interactions play central roles in cellular life. In particular, hundreds of expressed small RNA (sRNA) molecules were discovered in both pro- and eukaryotes, many of which act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression by base-pairing with their mRNA targets. It seems that in many organisms the layer of posttranscriptional regulation is as widespread as transcription regulation, presenting a major challenge towards achieving functional and mechanistic understanding of this regulation level. Here we propose to develop an innovative methodology for genome-wide detection of the sRNA targetome, all mRNA targets of cellular sRNAs. This new methodology combines in vivo structural probing with deep sequencing and is independent of protein considerations. We will apply this method to deciper the sRNA targetome of the model organism Escherichia coli, which encodes over 100 sRNAs.  We will use the sRNA targetome data as the foundation for a systematic &#226;&#128;&#152;bottom-up&#226;&#128;&#153; computational analysis of multifaceted aspects of sRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation, encompassing the basic underlying rules of sRNA-mRNA target recognition, the design principles of the posttranscriptional regulatory network and its integration with the transcriptional and metabolic networks, and the evolution of posttranscriptional regulation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,329,360</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PRECORT"><Rcn>94301</Rcn><Nid>10033</Nid><HI>University Of Leeds, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Pre-receptor cortisol metabolism and human ageing</Name><PI>Paul Michael Stewart</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The number of people over the age of 80 years in the 25 EU member states is currently 18.2 million or 4% of the total population; by 2020, 20% of the EU population will be &gt;65 years old which will place considerable burden upon limited health care resources. 70% of older adults report at least one chronic disease that contributes to a reduction in healthspan or the number of extra years spent in good health.

PRECORT Prereceptor Cortisol metabolism and human Ageing will test the hypothesis that age-related changes in body composition (central adiposity, reduced bone and muscle mass, skin thinning) and resulting chronic disease (diabetes, osteoporosis, sarcopaenia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease) are caused by excessive glucocorticoids as a result of age-related activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis and/or increased 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1), an enzyme that can generate cortisol locally within fat, bone, muscle and skin.

We will also address fundamental questions related to tolerance and autoimmunity by measuring frequency and distribution of self-reactive T cells in healthy donors and patients. The analysis of the response to microbes and allergens will address the possibility that different antigens, depending on abundance or location, may drive divergent Th cell responses, thus shedding light on the mechanisms of polarization and immunodominance in vivo. In pilot studies the project will also translate basic findings to the clinical setting, linking polarized Th responses to disease state and severity. Finally, using lentiviral-based approaches for gene silencing and overexpression, we will perform mechanistic studies to understand how environmental factors modulate in Th cells the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The hypotheses tested are strongly supported by preliminary observations from our own laboratory as well as from the biomedical literature.

By age 55, the accommodation capability is lost and optical aids are needed for near vision. Many questions remain open that are critical to understand accommodation, the failure in presbyopia, and the prospects for its correction. Multifocal presbyopic corrections are increasingly used. However, the ideal multifocal pattern, and the optical factors affecting depth-of-focus and adaptation to simultaneous vision remain to be elucidated. The most satisfactory treatment of presbyopia should rely on the restoration of the dynamic and continuous focusing ability of the eye, and this could be achieved in the form of accommodative intraocular lenses (IOLs). Current approaches, relying on potential IOL axial shifts, have proved little effective accommodative amplitude.
The project will seek in nature innovative solutions to treat presbyopia. Deeper understanding of the crystalline lens changes with dynamic accommodation and aging will be gained. Novel imaging techniques will be developed and used to assess the dynamic changes of crystalline lens structure, gradient index distribution and microscopic structure of the lens fibers and capsule. In addition, the treatment of presbyopia by multifocal corrections will be explored. Wavefront sensing and optical coherence tomography will be used to understand the bases for the multifocality found in some animal species (as possible inspiration for multifocal patterns), and adaptive optics and visual simulation to understand the reasons for the limited performance of current multifocal treatments, to investigate neural adaptation to the blur in simultaneous vision and to test the proposed new multifocal patterns.  Finally, the understanding of the crystalline lens properties and the biomechanics of the implanted IOLs gained in the project will allow to develop a first prototype of crystalline-lens mimicking accommodative IOL.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,399,548</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PRESSBIRTH"><Rcn>111288</Rcn><Nid>9020</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Arginine vasopressin and ion transporters in the modulation of brain excitability during birth and birth asphyxia seizures</Name><PI>Kai Kalervo Kaila</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>A transient period of asphyxia in the newborn is an obligatory part of normal parturition. A more prolonged disturbance in cerebral blood supply is a major cause of neonatal seizures. Current therapies of birth asphyxia seizures are ineffective and the underlying mechanisms are unknown.
Our recent landmark work on a rat model of birth asphyxia showed that asphyxia is followed by brain alkalosis, which triggers seizures. The brain-confined alkalosis is generated by activation of Na/H exchange in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Both alkalosis and the consequent seizures can be suppressed by graded restoration of the high CO2 level after asphyxia and with blockers of Na/H exchange.
Our pilot data indicate that arginine vasopressin (AVP) triggers the post-asphyxia seizures by activating the BBB-located luminal V1a receptor-coupled Na/H exchanger. Akin to human infants, a very high level of plasma copeptin (a part of pro-AVP) is seen following asphyxia but, notably, the copeptin levels remain low with graded restoration of normocapnia. Moreover, intravenous AVP V1a receptor antagonists, acting on the BBB, block the generation of seizures. In striking contrast, AVP suppresses network excitability when acting on V1aRs in the neonate hippocampus.
Thus, I hypothesize that AVP acts on the BBB to promote neonatal seizures, and that this effect is paralleled by a central anticonvulsant action. Next to nothing is known about AVP actions on ionic regulation in the brain. Our pilot data indicate that AVP inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 and activates the K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 in a manner consistent with reduction of excitability.
My laboratory has an internationally leading role in work on neuronal pH and Cl- regulation and on functions of the immature brain.  Understanding the mechanisms of AVP actions during normal birth and birth asphyxia will provide novel insights on the control of the excitability of the newborn brain. This work has a high translational impact.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,419</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PRIME"><Rcn>111592</Rcn><Nid>11399</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Polycomb repressor interactions in relation to the mammalian epigenome</Name><PI>Neil Alexander Steven Brockdorff</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"In mammals Polycomb group (PcG) repressors play a central role in maintaining cell type specific gene expression patterns in stem cells and through differentiation and development. Accordingly, deficiencies in the Polycomb system are important in disease, notably in several types of cancer.   Although it is established that the effector function of PcG proteins is in large part attributable to intrinsic histone modification activities, the mechanisms that target PcG proteins to defined loci remain poorly understood.  A number of different models have been proposed in order to account for PcG targeting to CpG islands at the promoters of target genes, the inactive X chromosome, and in defined circumstances, to pericentric constitutive heterochromatin. Our recent studies, and those of others, have highlighted that underlying chromatin state and DNA methylation play an important role, and based on this we have developed a general model that can account for PcG localisation at all target loci.  The central aim of this proposal is to test the general model and to determine the mechanisms by which underlying chromatin states dictate PcG factor binding. In a series of integrated experiments we will define chromatin modifications on mononucleosomes purified from PcG target loci, determine the activity of major PcG complexes in vitro using nucleosome templates assembled with recombinant histones/histone variants bearing specific chromatin modifications, and, using a novel photo-cross-linking strategy, define, at the atomic level, interactions of PcG complexes with chromatin templates in vitro. Finally, based on our findings we will establish de novo PcG target sites in cells and/or disrupt preexisting PcG target sites. These studies will help to define the fundamental mechanisms that determine PcG protein targeting, and in addition will provide insight into misregulation of PcG proteins in disease."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,421,394</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PRIONS"><Rcn>94411</Rcn><Nid>12079</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>The prion protein in health and disease</Name><PI>Adriano Aguzzi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Oligomers are toxic in an array of protein misfolding and aggregation (PMA) disorders. However, the chain of events from protein aggregation to dysfunction is poorly understood. Prion diseases are marked by accumulation of PrPSc, a misfolded variant of wild-type PrPC. PrPC mediates PrPSc neurotoxicity and counteracts toxic PrPC mutants, indicating that a subversion of normal PrPC function may underlie neurodegeneration, and this may not be limited to prion disease. Here, we propose to explore these newly discovered physiological functions of PrPC in three paradigms. We show that PrPC assembles into a multiprotein complex containing a protease; neurotoxic PrPC mutants generate a smaller complex that is uncleaved. We show that neuronal expression of PrPC is required in trans for long-term myelin maintenance in peripheral nerves. We will therefore investigate the hypothesis that a fragment of PrPC transmits signals crucial for axomyelinic integrity. We show that PrPC physically interacts with both amyloid b and islet amyloid polypeptide and attenuates functional impairment mediated by these peptides. We therefore propose to test whether subversion of normal PrPC function is involved in diverse PMA disorders. We developed an ex vivo model that accurately reproduces major features of prion infections, most notably neurodegeneration. We have identified several unexpected PrPSc-induced cellular stress pathways which may be common to other PMA disorders. Using this model system, we will clarify the role of PrPC in cell survival pathways and determine the requirement for PrPC in the pathology of other PMA disorders. This proposal capitalizes on provocative recent results and, if successful, will provide valuable insights into PMA toxicity that will go far beyond prion diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PRISTINE-PD"><Rcn>99240</Rcn><Nid>11463</Nid><HI>Lunds Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Prion-like transmission of &#206;&#177;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease</Name><PI>Patrik Brundin</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Protein misfolding is implicated as a pathogenetic mechanism in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson&#194;&#191;s disease (PD). In prion disease, the misfolded protein spreads between cells and acts as a &#194;&#191;permissive template&#194;&#191;, causing protein in the recipient cell to misfold. In 2008 we reported that classical neuropathological changes gradually propagate from a PD patient&#194;&#191;s brain to a graft of healthy neurons, over one decade after surgery. These groundbreaking findings suggest that the protein &#194;&#191;-synuclei may transfer between cells and propagate protein aggregation in a &#194;&#191;prion-like&#194;&#191; fashion in PD. This molecular disease mechanism might explain how protein aggregates gradually spread throughout the nervous system and promote progression of disease symptoms. This highly novel concept represents a hitherto poorly explored route of intercellular communication and might have far-reaching implications well beyond PD. Little is known about how various forms of &#194;&#191;-synuclein are taken up; if they seed aggregation in the recipient cell; how they affect proteostasis in the recipient cells; if they are transported axonally; and, finally, whether they can cause spreading of PD-like pathology in the nervous system.

Specifically, the new technology will identify and quantify every protein in a proteome. The title of the project Proteomics v3.0 was chosen to indicate the transformation of proteomics into its third phase, after 2D gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS based shotgun proteomics. Proteomics v3.0 is based on two sequential steps, emulating the strategy that has been immensely successful in the genomic sciences. In the first step the proteomic space is completely mapped out to generate a proteomic resource that is akin to the genomic sequence database. In the second step rapid and accurate assays will be developed to unambiguously identify and quantify any protein of the respective proteome in a multitude of samples. These assays will be made publicly accessible to support quantitative proteomic studies in the respective species.  The strategy will first be implemented and tested in the yeast S. cerevisiae. In a later stage of the project it will be extended to the more complicated human proteome and include the development of assays that also probe the state of modification, splice forms and other types of protein variants generated by a specific open reading frame.

An ignored cause is the inappropriate statistical treatment of two statistical problems: (1) selective inference, manifested in selecting few promising leads following the statistical analysis of the potential many, where ignoring the selection process on estimates, confidence intervals and observed significance; (2) using too optimistic a yardstick of variation with which confidence intervals set and statistical significance of the potential discovery is judged, as a result of ignoring the variability between laboratories and subjects. The first problem becomes more serious as the pool of potential discoveries increases, the second paradoxically becomes more serious as measuring ability improves, which explain why the two problems are more prominent in recent years. Both problems have statistical solutions, but the solutions are not practical as they burden the analysis to a point where the power to discover new findings is exceedingly low. Therefore, unless required by regulating agencies, scientists tend to avoid using these solutions.
I propose to develop methods that address such replicablity problems specific to medical research, epidemiology, genomics, brain research, and  behavioral neuroscience. The methods include (a) new hierarchical weighted procedures, and model selection methods, that control the false discovery rate in testing; (b) shorter confidence intervals that offer false coverage-statement rate for the selected, both addressing the concern about selective inference; and (c) a compromise between using random effects models for the laboratories and subjects and treating them as fixed, to be aided by multiple laboratory database in behavior genetics and neuroscience.

It fulfills major functions such as folding and quality control of membrane proteins, lipid biosynthesis, calcium storage, and modulation of apoptosis. This diversity of functions is accompanied by a complex 3D architecture, the maintenance of which is essential, since alterations lead to disease. How this architecture is generated, how proteins localize to specific subdomains and how structure and functions are coordinated is poorly understood. Our unpublished observations show that many ER membrane proteins, involved in key functions or in organelle shaping, are lipid modified, by the same palmitoyltransferases, and in a switch-like manner. We hypothesize that palmitoyltransferases act as regulators of the mammalian ER, controlling the function of a network of key proteins through reversible acylation, analogous to the control of signaling networks by phosphorylation. To establish the role of palmitoylation in coordinating ER structure/function, we propose a program integrating biochemical, functional and modeling approaches. We will determine the ER palmitome and investigate the impact of acylation on the function of individual proteins, on ER architecture and on the ER lipidome. We will analyze the interplay between and ubiquitination in controlling ER functions. Since we found that the DHHC6 palmitoytransferase is essential in mice and palmitoylates key ER proteins, we will study this enzyme in depth in terms of structure, function, target specific and regulation.

However, the principles governing its evolution have proved elusive. The rhizobium-legume symbiosis is one of the most sophisticated mutualistic interactions, as it results in the formation of a novel organ, the root nodule, where rhizobium is hosted intracellularly as nitrogen fixing &#226;&#128;&#152;organelles&#226;&#128;&#153;. These are named symbiosomes and produce ammonia from air.
The rhizobium legume symbiosis evolved shortly after the rise of the legume family; 60 million years ago. However, by convergent evolution it also evolved more recent in the non-legume Parasponia. Ever since the discovery of Parasponia as the only non-legume that independently evolved the nodule symbiosis with rhizobium, it has intrigued the scientific community. It has been clear that this &#226;&#128;&#152;bridging species&#226;&#128;&#153; will provide insight in how this unique symbiosis could arise during evolution. Further, it can teach us how to transfer this important agricultural trait to non-legume crops. However, it is first now that we can fully exploit the potential of this unique genus. Major insight in molecular mechanisms underlying the rhizobium legume symbiosis has been obtained by studying model legumes. This has made the rhizobium legume symbiosis one of the best understood mutualistic interactions. This insight can now be exploited to determine the evolutionary trajectory of the Parasponia rhizobium symbiosis, and to identify the genetic constraints of this interaction. Further, the revolution brought about by so-called next generation sequence technologies has made it now possible to cost efficiently sequence genomes of plant species with key positions in rhizobium nodule evolution.
The overall objective of this project is to identify the evolutionary trajectory underlying rhizobium nodule evolution by using Parasponia. To validate the findings I will copy this evolutionary trajectory in Trema; the non-nodulating sister genus of Parasponia.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,951</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PhagoDC"><Rcn>91081</Rcn><Nid>12251</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Integrative phagosomal biology: antigen presentation and developmental programs in dendritic cells</Name><PI>Diego Sebastian Amigorena</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Integrative phagosomal biology: antigen presentation and developmental programs in dendritic cells   Dendritic cells phagocytose incoming pathogens and dead cells in peripheral tissues, and then migrate to the draining lymph nodes where they deliver to lymphocytes all the  information  required for the initiation of adaptive immune responses. This information relates to the nature of the pathogen, which is sensed, both directly through pattern recognition receptors (including Toll-like receptors, TLRs), and indirectly through different receptors for cytokines and stress factors. This information also concerns the structure of the antigens, which will be presented to T lymphocytes in the form of proteolytic peptides loaded on MHC molecules. Phagosomes play a critical role in the processing of antigens for presentation to both MHC class II-restricted CD4+ T cells, and to MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells (a process called cross presentation). Importantly, antigen processing and presentation to T cells is influenced by the environment of the dendritic cells and by the type of TLR-ligands engaged. The present project aims to identify the molecular basis for the regulation of phagosomal functions (including oxidation, pH control and degradation) and antigen processing during the different developmental programs of DCs. Our main specific aims are: 1) to analyse the regulation of the phagosomal function during dendritic cell maturation, 2) to identify novel molecular players and pathways in antigen cross presentation using shRNA- based screens, and 3) to image dynamically phagocytic dendritic cell functions, in vitro and in vivo. This project will provide an integrated vision of the phagosomal function of dendritic cells and of its regulation during dendritic cell maturation. It will unravel novel molecular players and pathways involved in the control of the phagocytic function in general, and will contribute to understanding the molecular basis of immune recognition.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,214,702</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PhotoPhage"><Rcn>106935</Rcn><Nid>13001</Nid><HI>Technion - Israel Institute Of Technology, Israel</HI><Name>The role of viral photosynthetic proteins in oceanic photosynthesis</Name><PI>Oded Beja</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Cyanobacteria play a key role in marine photosynthesis, contributing almost 50% of primary production in oligotrophic regions of the ocean. Marine cyanophages were recently discovered to carry photosystem II (PSII) genes, and it was suggested that these genes increase phage fitness by helping the phages to maintain photosynthesis in the infected bacterial cells. We recently showed evidence for the presence of photosystem I (PSI) genes in genomes of marine cyanophages [Sharon et al. 2009 Nature 461, 258-262]. Cyanobacterial core PSI gene cassettes, containing psaJFABCDEK, or psaDCAB gene cassettes forms unique clusters in cyanophage genomes, suggestive of selection for a distinct function in virus reproduction. Potentially, the proteins encoded by the viral genes are sufficient for forming intact monomeric PSI complexes. Projection of viral predicted peptides on the cyanobacterial PSI crystal structure suggests that the viral PSI components provide a unique way for funneling reducing power from respiratory and other electron transfer chains to PSI, therefore bypassing the need to rely solely on reducing power from the photosystem electron transfer chain.
The main goals of this proposal are:
(1) To determine how much of oceanic photosynthesis is actually performed with viral proteins.
(2) To establish a model system to understand the role of modified photosynthetic viral proteins in photosynthesis
We hypothesize that viral photosynthetic peptides are integrated into the bacterial photosynthetic membranes in order to maintain photosynthesis in infected cells, that otherwise stop to photosynthesize, and that changes are introduced to the system as a whole.
The proposed research will integrate concepts and techniques from metagenomics, metaproteomics and bioinformatics techniques to explore the interaction of viral PSII and PSI proteins with their host reaction center complexes, and to examine their influence on global marine photosynthesis production</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,933,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PlantImmuSys"><Rcn>98059</Rcn><Nid>12670</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>The Plant Immune System: a multidisciplinary approach to uncover how plants simultaneously deal with beneficial and parasitic organisms to maximize profits and protection</Name><PI>Cornelis Marinus Jozef Pieterse</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In nature, plants live in complex environments in which they are attacked by a multitude of pathogens and pests. In agriculture this leads to tremendous annual crop losses, representing a value of over 450 billion worldwide. Beneficial associations between plants and other organisms are abundant in nature as well, improving plant growth or aiding plants to overcome biotic or abiotic stress. In the past years, we pioneered research on the complexity of the natural plant immune system that is engaged in interactions of plants with beneficial microbes, pathogens and insect herbivores. We discovered that the plant immune signaling network finely balances the plant&#194;&#191;s response to beneficial and harmful organisms to maximize both profitable and protective functions. As plants have co-evolved with an enormous variety of alien organisms, they harbour a fantastic reservoir of natural defensive mechanisms that until to date remained largely untapped. Here, I propose to mine this undiscovered natural resource in detail, using the Arabidopsis thaliana model system, and an innovative multidisciplinary approach involving a unique combination of state-of-the-art microbial and plant functional genomics, ecogenomics, molecular genetics, cellular biology, computational biology and bioinformatics. The outcomes of the proposed project will provide a detailed understanding of the intrinsic capacity of the plant immune system to simultaneously accommodate mutualists and ward off enemies in order to maximize benefits and minimize damage. Profitably, the discovery of novel plant loci and mechanisms involved in plant immunity will provide multi-faceted possibilities for development of new strategies for sustainable agriculture and resistance breeding of economically relevant crop species.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PopPhyl"><Rcn>91080</Rcn><Nid>13057</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Population phylogenomics: linking molecular evolution to species biology</Name><PI>Nicolas Galtier</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The aim of the PopPhyl project is to characterize the population genetic environment of many representative plant and animal species, in order to elucidate which biological and ecological factors determine molecular evolutionary processes - we want to know why genomes evolve the way they evolve. We will establish predictions about the influence of ecological (population size, varying environment) and genetical (mating systems, life cycle, mutation rate) variables on comparative genomic patterns thanks to improved molecular evolutionary theory relying on Fisher's geometric model. Predictions will be checked empirically by collecting extensive data sets of within-species and between-species genomic diversity in a large number of well-chosen taxa, with monitored life history traits. Massive gene sequences will be obtained from the extraction and analysis of abundant mRNA's, ensuring comparability between even distant taxa. These data will allow us to assess, and compare across species, the population genetic parameters relevant to molecular evolution: effective population size, mutation rate, strength of positive and negative selection. The main focus of the project is on the influence of population size, mating systems and life-span on molecular evolutionary rates. Are abundant species genetically more diverse? Do they adapt more efficiently? Is self-fertilization the evolutionary dead-end it is said to be? Why are fast-evolving proteomes fast: higher mutation rate, or prominent adaptive evolution ? PopPhyl is an ambitious, long-term multi-disciplinary project lying at the boundary of phylogenetics and population genetics, and requiring intensive theoretical and bioinformatic developments. We want to explore a new dimension of evolutionary biology by making population genetics comparative, and by injecting species ecology into genomic analyses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,000,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="PreventRA"><Rcn>94242</Rcn><Nid>11531</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>Genes, environment and immunity in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis</Name><PI>Lars G&#195;&#182;ran Yngve Klareskog</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Aims and significance: The aims of this program are (1) To obtain new understanding of how environmental and life style factors interact with genes to induce immune reactions able to cause the different forms of arthritis that are defined as RA; (2) To use this understanding to develop prevention and targeted therapy for different forms of RA, and to enable efficient and eventually curative therapy. Background: We build on new understanding or RA etiology that has followed from studies on interactions between genes, environment and immunity in different subsets of RA. This has been provided for new detailed studies on specific and eventually disease-inducing autoimmunity in RA. Research program: We will use our infrastructure (longitudinal large cohorts, biobanks genetic information and our molecular immunology laboratory) to investigate (1) how genes and environment interact in causing different forms of RA; (2) how specific immune reactions against post-translationally modified (mainly citrullinated) autoantigens are triggered by environmental agents in specific genetic contexts in different individuals; (3) How these immune reactions target different organs (joints, lungs etc) and eventually cause arthritis in model systems; (4) how the combination of genes, environment and immunity may determine disease course and response to various therapies. Novelty and opportunities to take knowledge of autoimmune disease and RA to a new level: The recent advances in understanding interactions between genes, environment and immunity in RA, provides a striking new opportunity to understand basic features of autoimmunity and autoimmune disease, as well as potentials to prevent and treat RA very early.

While public health research has uncovered a great deal about the proximal causes of these deaths, identifying alcohol and psychosocial stress as key causes, incredibly few studies have attempted to address the variation in these proximal causes. Why did people in some countries start to abuse alcohol much more and experience greater stress than in others? A recent article in The Lancet by the PI linked radical privatization policies to increased mortality via increased unemployment using longitudinal cross-national statistics.  This article generated great controversy, and soon a critics claimed that with different specifications the model was not sufficiently robust, or that the cross-national data could conceal an ecological fallacy or miss another cause. Our study will provide decisive evidence on this debate by proposing a new methodology for studying the impact of economic policies on public health, and in so doing advancing an emerging new research tradition we call the Political Economy of Public Health. We will do this by way of developing an innovative methodology of establishing a convenience cohort study, based on the Brass indirect method traditionally used by demographers in countries without reliable vital registration data. The Brass method uses interviews with random population samples to collect data on deaths of their relatives to estimate key population mortality parameters. Our innovation is to select one-company towns that were privatized in a radical way, and matching them with towns which had a different privatization experience. In this way we can generate micro-data to test the privatization thesis. We will also be able to measure the importance of occupation on mortality.  This new research method promises new tools to study the impact of large-scale politicaal, economic and organizational change on population health.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,483,058</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ProNet"><Rcn>107853</Rcn><Nid>9531</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>ProNet- Prosthetic Transgene Networks for the Treatment of Metabolic Disorders</Name><PI>Martin Anton Fussenegger</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Since living memory, the basic treatment strategies for the therapy of human diseases has not much changed conceptually. Although the molecular understanding of metabolic disorders continues to progress significantly the therapeutic strategy is still based on specific, often heterologous compounds which interfere with critical disease targets, trigger a metabolic bypass reaction or complement a molecular deficiency. As systems biology is revealing gene-function correlations and metabolic network dynamics at great pace and synthetic biology enables bottom-up de-novo design of genetic devices with predictable behaviour, time has now come to develop novel treatment strategies. Prosthetic genetic networks are expected to play a central part of such future treatment strategies. Prosthetic networks are synthetic sensor/effector devices or molecular prostheses which, upon integration into cells and functional connection to their metabolism, monitor disease-relevant metabolites, process off-level concentrations and coordinate adjusted diagnostic, preventive or therapeutic responses in a seamless, automatic and self-sufficient manner. Using a synthetic biology approach and capitalizing on our pioneering prosthetic network designed to control urate homeostasis and treat the tumour lysis syndrome as well as gouty arthritis, ProNet is a highly integrated, multiparallel and interdisciplinary effort to provide a series of prosthetic sensor/effector circuits for precise trigger-control of therapeutic transgenes. ProNet will focus on providing novel treatment opportunities for diabetes and obesity, two core pathologies of the metabolic syndrome, which is on its way to become the top epidemic of the 21st century. ProNet may provide new opportunities for the treatment strategies of the future thereby making the classic therapy of taking pills and getting injections in specified amounts and at particular times likely to become a thing of the past.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ProteinSeq"><Rcn>102470</Rcn><Nid>10373</Nid><HI>Uppsala Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Sensitive, specific high-throughput plasma proteome analysis via ProteinSeq</Name><PI>Dag Ake Ulf Landegren</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Despite increasing interest in biomarkers to diagnose and distinguish diseases and select treatment few new protein biomarkers are being successfully validated. Important explanations for the limited success are poor specificity and sensitivity of detection of plasma proteins using current assays, and inability to analyze large numbers of markers and samples.  Improved assays should provide access to plasma protein biomarkers at levels below current detection thresholds, potentially reflecting disease processes anywhere in the body at early stages. They should also distinguish closely similar protein variants. The assays should furthermore assess numerous markers in parallel with limited consumption of biobank samples.
The aim of this project is to enable investigations of protein biomarkers at entirely new levels of performance. The basis of the proposal is our expertise in molecular tools and specifically an approach to protein analysis that addresses the above requirements.
This technology is now ready to be scaled for large-volume, high-performance assays with the following characteristics: 1) Unsurpassed specificity via simultaneous detection of three epitopes on any target protein. 2) Amplifiable DNA strands form upon specific detection, permitting ultrasensitive detection. 3) Only appropriate reagent combinations result in amplifiable reporter strands, overcoming obstacles to multiplex protein detection. 4) Tag sequences in the amplified DNA strands identify the detected proteins and the investigated samples, allowing digital information of protein abundance to be retrieved via next generation DNA sequencing of multiplex reactions for large numbers of patients in single runs.

Also the phylogenetic relationships and the emergence order of major eukaryotic lineages remain unresolved, despite progress in phylogenomic analyses based on genome and transcriptome data across the eukaryotic tree. However, this information is biased towards multicellular taxa. Yet, environmental molecular analyses have uncovered a vast diversity of protists (broadly, microbial eukaryotes), many of which have uncertain phylogenetic position. Phylogenomics also suggests that endosymbiosis (e.g. mitochondrial acquisition) played a key role in eukaryotic evolution, shaping their genomes and leading to innovations. The first eukaryotes likely evolved in anoxic or transition-to-oxic (suboxic) environments, which may hold clues as to the occurring selective constraints, prior to colonizing new niches thanks to oxygen-respiring mitochondria. Despite so, little is known about the diversity and mode of evolution of eukaryotes in suboxic worlds, including microbial mats and stromatolites, where many inter-species interactions are likely to exist. I propose an integrative interdisciplinary approach to gain significant knowledge about early eukaryotic evolution according to the following hypotheses: i) High diversity suboxic environments, such as microbial mats, hide novel divergent protist lineages. ii) The study of natural fossilization processes of microbial eukaryotes in calcifying microbial mats such as stromatolites will lead to the definition of biosignatures in the past fossil record and to establish reference dates for the origin of eukaryotes and/or particular eukaryotic taxa. iii) Phylogenomic analysis of divergent protist lineages from suboxic environments will help resolving the eukaryotic tree of life and dating major splits in eukaryotic lineages. iv) Protist symbiosis with prokaryotes is widespread in suboxic worlds and that (endo)symbiotic-gene transfer has an important impact in protist evolution.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,039,812</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="QSIS"><Rcn>94450</Rcn><Nid>11533</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Role of Quorum Sensing mechanisms in the Immune System s regulation</Name><PI>Antonio Angelo Bastos Alves De Freitas</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The homeostatic control of lymphocyte numbers provides the immune system with a basic mechanism that shapes the repertoire of the immune-competent cells and therefore, the capacity to respond to exogenous antigens as well as to maintain self-tolerance. Homeostatic mechanisms will also enable the re-establishment of the immune system following disruption (irradiation or chemotherapy). During the process of restoration, the immune system can be reset at a new equilibrium overcoming any of its previous malfunctions. This capacity of homeostatic regulation may therefore be used in potential therapeutic strategies to radically modify lymphocyte repertoires, immune responses, autoimmune disease and allergy. We now postulate that control of lymphocyte numbers may be achieved by the ability of lymphocytes to perceive the density of their own populations. Lymphocytes may use quorum-sensing mechanisms to coordinate their gene expression according to the density of their population, as long as lymphocytes have (a) a mean of assessing the number of components they interact with and (b) a standard response once a threshold number of components is detected. To address the role of quorum-sensing in the Immune System this project aims: 1) To study the role of quorum-sensing mechanisms in the homeostasis of natural activated IgM-secreting and memory B cell populations, by studying the role of secreted IgG in these processes. 2) To determine the role of quorum-sensing mechanisms associated with the homeostasis of na&#195;&#175;ve and regulatory CD4+ T cells, by studying the role of IL-2 titers in T cell homeostasis.

My
laboratory has described a new mechanism for such cell renewal in yeast, in which damaged
protein aggregates are transported out of the daughter buds along actin cables to preserve
youthfulness. Such spatial protein quality control (SQC) is a Sir2p-dependent process and by establishing the global genetic interaction network of SIR2, we identified the
polarisome as the machinery required for mitotic segregation and translocation of protein
aggregates. In addition, we found that the fusion of smaller aggregates into large inclusion
bodies, a process that has been suggested to reduce the toxicity of such aggregates, requires
actin cables and their nucleation at the septin ring. Sir2p controls damage segregation by
affecting deacetylation and the activity of the chaperonin CCT, enhancing actin folding and
polymerization. Considering that CCT has been implicated in mitigating
aggregation/toxicity of polyglutamine proteins, e.g. huntingtin, and that actin cables is
affecting formation, fusion, and resolution of aggregates, we hypothesize that CCT
deacetylation may underlie Sirt1&#194;&#191;s (mammalian orthologues of Sir2p) documented beneficial
effects in several neurodegenerative disorders caused by proteotoxic aggregates. This project
is aimed at approaching this hypothesis and to elucidate, on a genome-wide scale, how the
cell tether, sort, fuse, and detoxify aggregates with the help of CCT, actin cables, and the
polarity machinery. This will be accomplished by combining the power of synthetic genetic
array analysis, high-content imaging, genome wide proximity ligand assays, and microfluidics.
Using such approaches, the project seeks to decipher the machineries of the spatial quality
control network as a means to identify new therapeutic targets that may retard or postpone
the development of age-related maladies, including neurodegenerative disorders.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,371,262</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RADMED"><Rcn>104425</Rcn><Nid>11075</Nid><HI>Universiteit Maastricht, Netherlands</HI><Name>Radical Medicine: Redefining Oxidative Stress</Name><PI>Harald Horst Heinz Wilhem Schmidt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Oxidative stress, an excess of radical and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been suggested as a major disease mechanism. However, the major clinical trials using anti-oxidants have been failures, even suggesting serious side effects. Here, I propose completely different approaches: First, instead of letting radicals form and then scavenge them we will identify their diseases-relevant sources and prevent their formation or specifically repair the damage caused by ROS. Second, we will differentiate beneficial signalling roles of ROS. In combination, this will result in unprecedented precision and molecular specificity. In 2010, I submitted a somewhat related proposal to the ERC and received a comment as being &#226;&#128;&#156;too focused on essential hypertension&#226;&#128;&#157;. This proposal has a much broader focus and impact beyond cardiovascular diseases. In the past months we achieved major breakthroughs by identifying a radical/ROS source (NOX4) as fundamental mechanism in stroke, the fastest growing and soon no 1 cause of death. We are also developing in phase II a radical formation inhibitor for neurotrauma. Moreover, our basic research facilitated the development of drug classes re-activating an oxidatively damaged signalling receptor, now in phase III. Further, we identified angiogenesis as a radical/ROS-dependent and protective (!) signalling event. This proposal is just the beginning: our basic science will open up new fields and leap forward in personalized medicine with groundbreaking technologies and approaches. We will contribute to the diagnosis and early identification of patients at risk and to monitor their successful treatment (in vitro/blood-based); to the localization of disease processes (in vivo/molecular imaging) before the onset of symptoms; and to a new generation of more effective, predictable, and mechanism-based drugs.

We will study how new traits such as drugR arise rapidly using Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans. The work explores the ground-breaking concept that alterations in genome ploidy are prevalent in drugR isolates because these genome states promote persistence and drug resistance.
We recently found that C. albicans, thought to be an &#226;&#128;&#156;obligate diploid&#226;&#128;&#157;, can form haploids. This represents a major paradigm shift both technologically and conceptually. We are poised to exploit this unique opportunity to reinvent genomic approaches for C. albicans by leveraging next generation sequencing, high throughput analyses and more traditional genetics. Because haploids are much less fit than heterozygous diploids, our working hypothesis is that changes in ploidy, including whole genome ploidy and aneuploidy, occur frequently under drug stress and that they make major contributions to the rapid appearance of genotypic and phenotypic diversity, in part by promoting persistence.
The objectives of this proposal are to develop next-generation technologies that leverage haploids; to characterize the conditions and genes that promote ploidy transitions, especially in the presence of drug, in vitro and in vivo and to analyze their fitness consequences. This multi-disciplinary research program will integrate = approaches at the genetic, genomic, molecular, cellular and population levels and includes computational approaches to model evolutionary processes.
The project will lead to unparalleled advances in tools for the research community, and important insights concerning how diversity arises rapidly.

The latter is of paramount importance in order to develop efficacious therapies against tumors carrying Ras oncogenes - an achievement that could save thousands of lives worldwide.

To date it has proven impossible to target the RAS proteins directly and it is unclear whether combined targeting of downstream pathways that RAS controls will prove effective. We have previously probed the unique vulnerabilities of RAS mutant cancer cells using synthetic lethal genome-wide screening approaches. This has led to the identification of a transcriptional programme controlled by GATA2 that is selectively essential for RAS mutant lung cancer cell survival. Deletion of GATA2 leads to dramatic regression of RAS induced in lung cancer in mouse models. Although GATA2 itself is likely to be undruggable, combined suppression of two GATA2 regulated pathways, ROCK and the proteasome, with clinically approved inhibitors causes marked tumour clearance.
We propose to investigate the ability of these promising targeting strategies to impact on various RAS induced cancers and also to investigate mechanistic aspects of this dependency on GATA2 function. We will test the effect of GATA2 deletion or ROCK/proteasome combination therapy on RAS mutant tumour maintenance in the setting of p53 loss, both in lung and pancreatic cancer. In addition, we will determine the mechanisms involved in the dependency of RAS mutant cancers on these pathways in vivo, including investigating effects on the interaction of the tumour with host tissues, with a view to finding improved means of targeting these tumours and avoiding the development of resistance to these therapies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,496,221</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RATLAND"><Rcn>111228</Rcn><Nid>10117</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Understanding Auditory Information Processing in Naturalistic Environments</Name><PI>Israel Nelken</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Studies of sensory processing in awake mammals are often limited to simple perceptual decisions, such as detecting the differences between two similar stimuli. However, such sensory tasks are usually limited by peripheral information, and do not tap into the special processing capabilities of the cortex. I hypothesize that neuronal responses in auditory cortex represent ethologically-relevant quantities that optimally summarize knowledge about the current scene and that allow behaviourally-relevant predictions of its future development. In order to study the role of such mechanisms in controlling behaviour, it is necessary to develop new technological and methodological tools.
I will develop a semi-natural living environment for rats that will make it possible to train multiple animals to perform behavioural tasks while continuously recording the electrical activity of their brains. Neural activity will be recorded continuously using telemetry inside the environment, or periodically outside it with chronic imaging techniques. Brain activity will be manipulated with optogenetic techniques. This methodology will minimize human intervention, increasing the reproducibility of behavioral and electrophysiological data collection while reducing the number of animals used.
Various amount of information about the states of the environment will be communicated to the rats with sounds. I will apply a new theory that rigorously quantifies the balance between information and reward. The theory will make it possible to deduce what the rats believe about the environment from their behavior, and to correlate these beliefs with neural activity.
Hearing disorders are a major cause of reduction of quality of life, especially in the elderly population. Better understanding of auditory processing in real-world scenarios is a crucial step for the future development of better tools and therapies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RECMITMEI"><Rcn>98874</Rcn><Nid>12794</Nid><HI>The Francis Crick Institute Limited, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Regulating recombination in mitotic and meiotic cells</Name><PI>Simon Joseph Boulton</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>DNA is a highly reactive molecule that is subject to deliberate, spontaneous and environmental damage. One of the most catastrophic lesions in DNA is the double-strand break (DSB), which if left unrepaired can result in cell death, infertility, genome instability and cancer. Homologous recombination (HR) is a largely error-free mechanism of DSB repair that utilizes an intact sister or homologous chromosome as a repair template. Despite considerable progress in understanding the mechanisms of HR, very little is known about how this process is regulated. My lab has made a number of seminal discoveries that have improved our understanding of how HR is regulated in mitotic and meiotic cells. In this ERC proposal, we plan to elucidate the mechanisms that control HR events in mitotic cells and regulate HR pathway choice during meiotic recombination. We will place particular emphasis on defining the roles of RTEL1 and HELQ1 in regulating HR in mitotic and meiotic cells and will determine how dysfunction of these genes contributes to tumorigenesis. Biochemistry and proteomic approaches will be employed to determine how the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway counteracts error-prone repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), thus favouring HR repair in S-phase. The use of NHEJ inhibitors as a potential treatment of FA will be tested in existing mouse models of FA. Finally, genetic screens and proteomic analysis of HR regulators will be performed in C. elegans to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the choice between crossover and non-crossover pathways during meiotic HR.  Thus, in the work proposed here, my lab will make use of multiple experimental approaches to elucidate the mechanisms for control of HR and the consequences of dysregulated HR on human disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,379,104</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REDOX"><Rcn>102471</Rcn><Nid>10372</Nid><HI>University Of Dundee, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Reporter models for the Evaluation of Diseases involving OXidative stress</Name><PI>Charles Roland Wolf</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Perturbations in cellular redox status are implicated in many human diseases, yet there is an extreme lack of knowledge about the effects of oxidative stress in vivo, mainly due to difficulties in measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo and the absence of experimental models.  REDOX will use novel transgenic technologies to develop mouse models that report on ROS in vivo, allowing spatio-temporal monitoring of different types of oxidative stress, ultimately simultaneously in a complex reporter line, and clarifying its role in the aetiology of disease and pathways of drug &amp; chemical toxicity. These models will reveal oxidative stress as a primary cause, or a consequence, of the disease process.  Reporters will be driven by endogenous genes regulated by different forms of oxidative stress and, uniquely, we will exploit the sophisticated redox sensing systems in bacteria to discern different types of ROS. In a sophisticated system we will express 3 reporters from the same stress regulated promotor, generating a polycistronic mRNA by use of the FMDV 2A sequence, which cleaves the nascent polypeptide to yield the endogenous gene product and individual reporters. LacZ will be used as an in situ reporter, luciferase for imaging, and a secreted protein, eg hCG, as a non-invasive biomarker in blood or urine. The in vivo role of oxidative stress in disease aetiology, and the potential of novel anti-oxidants to prevent such diseases, will be evaluated in these models. A further novel aspect will be to generate ES cells from the reporter lines, and create genetically-driven disease models which reflect inherited human diseases.  REDOX combines ambitious experimental systems with sophisticated novel technologies to create models to define the role of oxidative stress in human disease, offering a new approach in defining and testing of disease prevention and therapeutic interventions while reducing the number of animals required."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,486,524</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REFINE"><Rcn>107187</Rcn><Nid>9516</Nid><HI>Universitaet Bern, Switzerland</HI><Name>Phenotypic plasticity, animal welfare, and the validity of animal experiments</Name><PI>Hanno W&#195;&#188;rbel</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Using animals for research is a privilege granted by society to scientists on the explicit understanding that such use will provide significant new knowledge, and no unnecessary harm will be imposed on the animals. However, a high prevalence of abnormal behaviour and other signs of distress in animals housed under standard laboratory conditions, and poor reproducibility of experimental results, suggest that current practice needs to improve to guarantee sound science. Recently we have shown in mice that standard housing conditions may interfere with behavioural control mechanisms expressed as overt behavioural disorders. These findings question both the animals&#226;&#128;&#153; welfare and the validity of research conducted with them. Furthermore, we have shown that current practice of standardisation may compromise the external validity of experimental results, resulting in poor reproducibility and spurious results. The overall hypothesis underlying this project is that both impaired welfare and poor reproducibility are caused by a failure to account for fundamental principles of phenotypic plasticity, whereby animal welfare is impaired when the animals&#226;&#128;&#153; adaptive plasticity is overtaxed, and reproducibility is compromised when phenotypic variation is standardised away. Based on this framework, the project, therefore, aims to systematically assess environmental effects on the welfare of laboratory animals and on the validity and reproducibility of animal experiments, using the mouse as a model species. The new results should greatly advance our understanding of environmental effects on the quality of life of laboratory animals and on the quality of science conducted with them. They should help to reconcile laboratory animal science with the biological principles of phenotypic plasticity, thereby providing significant new knowledge for effective Refinement of animal research. This should benefit the science as well as the animals in the best meaning of the 3R concept.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,333,140</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REJOIND"><Rcn>104817</Rcn><Nid>12487</Nid><HI>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</HI><Name>The manufacturing of a biological tissue: REgeneration of the JOINt by Developmental engineering</Name><PI>Frank Prosper J Luyten</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The general aim of REJOIND is to provide proof-of-principle for the in vitro manufacturing of a growing bone, with a bioartificial growth plate as a &#226;&#128;&#156;driving engine&#226;&#128;&#157; at its core. To achieve this, we propose a developmental engineering approach, based on the modular design of in vitro processes consisting of sequential units corresponding to in vivo developmental stages.  These processes follow a gradual and coordinated progression of tissue growth and cell differentiation that leads to organization of cells into intermediate tissue forms. At every step of the developmental engineering process, computational models will be applied, in order to form a  quantitative foundation for every process and to optimize these. After establishment of a manufacturing process of a growth plate, REJOIND will combine this tissue with osteoblasts or articular chondrocytes to build osteochondral tissues or bioartificial joints. Ultimately, REJOIND aims to achieve an autonomous process of in vitro tissue growth allowing guided size expansion. A close interaction between biologists and engineers will make this possible. Pre-clinical applications that will be explored in animal models range from the repair of deep osteochondral defects in a joint surface, to a total joint replacement for small arthritic joints. We expect that a number of these implants will provide a cartilaginous template for bone formation, therefore some will be tested in vivo in appropriate models for healing of long bone defects. In conclusion, REJOIND aims to provide evidence that through the use of developmental engineering, we can build a tissue in vitro, moving the boundary from manufacturing and control at the cellular level to tissue organization and function. This methodology will result in a more reliable in vivo outcome of tissue engineered products, and thus a more predictable and sustainable clinical outcome in the patient."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,057,673</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REM NETWORKS"><Rcn>103160</Rcn><Nid>10631</Nid><HI>European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany</HI><Name>"Exploring the interface between cell metabolism and gene regulation: from mRNA interactomes to ""REM Networks"""</Name><PI>Matthias Werner Hentze</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The question of how (intermediary) metabolism and the regulation of gene expression are inter-connected represents one of the central challenges for the next decade of research. This proposal aims to take a decisive stab at this question, exploiting hidden gems from the literature and modern day technologies.

Some metabolic enzymes have been caught &#226;&#128;&#156;moonlighting&#226;&#128;&#157; as RNA-binding proteins and, intriguingly, their RNA-binding activities appear to be under the control of metabolites and/or cofactors of these enzymes. Moonlighting enzymes could thus act as metabolite-controlled RNA regulators in RNA-enzyme-metabolite, or &#226;&#128;&#156;REM&#226;&#128;&#157; networks, imposing post-transcriptional influence on gene expression in metabolite-dependent ways. The riboswitches found in bacteria offer a precedent for how metabolites can have a direct effect on RNA metabolism.

Within this proposal, we describe how we plan to uncover &#226;&#128;&#156;all&#226;&#128;&#157; the mRNA-binding proteins (the mRNA interactomes) of eukaryotic cells in vivo, a feat which would have been impossible until recently. Following the determination of the mRNA interactomes of yeast and three strategically chosen mammalian cell lines, we will focus our follow-up analyses on the RNA-binding enzymes of intermediary metabolism of these interactomes: decipher their bound RNA targets, learn how different metabolic states and metabolites affect the RNA-enzyme interactions and, most importantly, establish the physiological importance of the studied REM networks.

The determination of mRNA interactomes will generate an unprecedented resource for the RNA biology community. We undertake this work with the motivation to uncover a key principle of how metabolism and gene expression may be connected, opening a new field of investigation for different disciplines in biomedical research, and unveiling a level of cellular regulation that would have broad implications for our understanding of basic biology and disease.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,186</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REPBLOCK"><Rcn>106974</Rcn><Nid>12844</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>SITE-SPECIFIC DNA REPLICATION PERTURBATION AND ITS EFFECTS ON CHROMOSOME SEGREGATION</Name><PI>Ian David Hickson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Challenges to the stable maintenance of the human genome can come from both endogenous and exogenous
sources. However, one of the major threats to genome stability occurs during normal DNA metabolism. The
genome is particularly susceptible to perturbation during the S-phase of the cell cycle when DNA replication
occurs. This is because DNA replication forks can encounter chemical adducts, DNA secondary structures,
topological constraints or bound proteins that hinder their progression. In actively proliferating cells, such as
stem cells, replication perturbation can lead to fork stalling, breakage or collapse. These scenarios can, in
turn, generate deleterious chromosomal rearrangements that have the potential to initiate human disease.
Despite recent advances in our understanding of the biochemical process of DNA replication, the precise
details of the events occurring at sites where replication forks have been perturbed remain poorly
characterised. This is because in-depth analysis of the perturbation of replication represents a major technical
challenge, principally because adducts and lesions generated by DNA damaging agents are randomly
distributed throughout the genome at sites that cannot be controlled or predicted. To overcome this technical
limitation, we have developed systems for site-specific perturbation of DNA replication that can be
transferred to any locus in any cell type. The aim is to define how replication fork perturbation is detected
and engaged by cellular stress-response factors, and then tolerated or repaired. This highly integrated
proposal, and the pioneering technologies that will be used to fulfil our ambitious aims, will have significant
implications for the understanding not only of replication perturbation and its effects on chromosome
dynamics in mitosis, but also of the role of replication stress in the aetiology of cancer and premature ageing.
It will open up new horizons both in and across these fields of research."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,456,760</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REPLENICHE"><Rcn>102958</Rcn><Nid>11083</Nid><HI>Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Cell cycle regulation of ES cell identity and reprogramming potential</Name><PI>Amanda Fisher</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) and germ (EG) cells differ from other stem cells in several respects. They display a characteristically &#226;&#128;&#152;compressed&#226;&#128;&#153; cell cycle in which G1 is shortened, contain a high proportion of cells in DNA synthesis (S)-phase and lack several cell cycle checkpoints. This unusual cell cycle signature is important for maintaining their identity since cell cycle arrest, or lengthening, results in irreversible differentiation, and somatic cells assume this unusual signature when successfully reprogrammed.

We have shown that ES and EG cells rapidly convert somatic cells towards pluripotency in transient heterokaryons, and this can be enhanced by genetic modification or using ES cells enriched at G2-phase. On the other hand, mouse epiblast stem (EpiS) and ES cells that lack specific repressor activities (such as Polycomb) although pluripotent, do notdominantly convert somatic cells and show increased doubling times. To determine the importance of cell cycle control for pluripotent self-renewal, we have optimised elutriation to allow the isolation of ES, EG and EpiS cells at progressive stages of the cell cycle. Pilot studies show changes in the levels of modified histones as ES cells transit the cell cycle, and increased levels of specific reprogramming factors during G2-phase. We will extend these analyses genome wide (using ChIP and RNA Seq, and high throughput proteomics) and use fluorescent microscopy to document changes in chromatin dynamics during ES cell cycle, and during somatic cell reprogramming. This will be achieved using novel micro-fluidic approaches to generate heterokaryons between ES, EG, EpiS and lymphocytes. The importance of cell cycle stage and its relevance during early events in successful reprogramming will be tested in heterokaryon and hybrid assays using conditional mutant cells, RNAi-based approaches and cell cycle inhibitors to block critical components."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,038,170</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RESET"><Rcn>98758</Rcn><Nid>8744</Nid><HI>Istituto Di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Italy</HI><Name>Dreaming of no more renal dialysis: how self-derived tissue and cells can replace renal function</Name><PI>Giuseppe Remuzzi</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"For chronic kidney diseases there is little chance that the vast majority of the world&#194;&#191;s population will have access to renal replacement therapy with dialysis. There is yet no adequate alternative with curative intent than allo-transplantation. This approach is seriously impaired by eventually limited graft survival and by the scarce availability of donors. We propose an innovative strategy that would help to simultaneously overwhelm the reduced access to dialysis, the need for organs for transplantation, the avoidance of patient exposure to immunosuppressants. The overall focus is based on the idea of generating new kidneys by tissue engineering technologies starting from a whole-kidney scaffold with intact three-dimensional geometry and vasculature created by de-cellularization of a kidney harvested from the patient with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Repopulation of the kidney scaffold could be achieved with patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated by reprogramming to a pluripotent status of somatic cells. After regeneration, the kidney will be transplanted in the same patient. Thereafter, the same procedures will be repeated with the contralateral native injured kidney, after in vivo assessment of the proper functional performance of the newly generated transplanted organ.
This goal will be pursued through the three steps introductory to the development of the best strategy for translating the proposed frontier research to patients with CKD:
1.Create an intact whole-kidney scaffold by de-cellularization of a rodent kidney and validate the
procedure with a human kidney.
2. Attempt to reconstruct the organ by reseeding the rodent and human whole-kidney scaffolds
with iPS cells generated by reprogramming adult dermal fibroblasts to a pluripotent status.
3. Deeply characterize the function of the new rodent and human kidneys by in vivo and in vitro
techniques."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RESIST"><Rcn>98818</Rcn><Nid>11624</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Resistance systems and population structure of parasites</Name><PI>Paul Hermann Schmid</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The study of parasitism is important for human welfare but also addresses basic scientific questions cutting across biological disciplines. Traditionally, studies of host-parasite interactions have used various scenarios of how genotypes of the two parties interact based on well-developed theory. Yet, one of the most striking observations is the huge variation in resistance systems across organisms. We lack an appreciation of the diversity of these resistance systems and how they affect, in turn, the parasites. Here, it is proposed to investigate the hypothesis that variation in gene expression is a key element that defines an alternative, flexible and highly adaptable resistance system. The project attempts to unify genomic studies of defence mechanisms with questions of evolutionary ecology of host-parasite interactions. Therefore, the study focuses on an ecologically well-studied system of hosts (Bombus spp.) and their prevalent trypanosome infections (Crithidia). In this system, a highly genetically polymorphic parasite is kept in check by a host with seemingly conserved immune effectors (e.g. anti-microbial peptides, AMPs). Their expression varies depending on the host-parasite pairing, suggesting that variation of the synergistic mixture of expressed defence elements might be crucial and could affect parasite population structure in turn. In the project, experiments and cutting-edge molecular methods will be applied to a natural host-parasite system."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,100,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="REVOLUTION"><Rcn>89087</Rcn><Nid>13056</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>RNA silencing in regulation and evolution</Name><PI>David Baulcombe</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Small RNA is a specificity determinant of silencing mechanisms that can target RNA through base pairing to affect RNA stability and translation. This targeting process, directly or indirectly, can also target DNA and chromatin to introduce epigenetic modifications. In plants there are many   hundreds of thousands - of different small silencing RNAs (sRNAs) produced from many thousands of loci. These sRNAs have enormous potential to influence genetic and epigenetic regulation because, from analysis of transgenes, it is clear that RNA silencing can have diverse effects. There can be RNA-mediated signalling between cells and complex interaction networks of RNA molecules with positive feedback and amplification loops.  In addition there can be epigenetic effects that, once induced, can persist between generations.  In REVOLUTION the aim is to find out which of the endogenous sRNAs have the various RNA silencing properties revealed by transgenes. The aim is then to integrate these findings into a systems level understanding of regulation and evolution in Arabidopsis. The role of these sRNA systems will be investigated in plants subjected to hormone and stress treatments. We shall also investigate the role of these sRNAs in natural variation between genotypes of plant and their effect in hybrids between these plants. In the final stages of the work it is intended to explore the various effects of endogenous sRNAs in plants other than Arabidopsis including tomato.  This work will provide a new level of understanding of the mechanisms affecting gene expression in plants. This fundamental new understanding will affect crop science through conventional breeding and genetic engineering. In addition because RNA silencing takes place in animals including vertebrates there will be relevance of this work beyond plants.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,298,433</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RISKYREWARDS"><Rcn>103848</Rcn><Nid>10580</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Neuronal processing of risky rewards</Name><PI>Robert Wolfram Schultz</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Background: Rewards are important positive factors for our survival, reproduction and quality of life. They produce learning, constitute goals of voluntary behaviour and are outcomes of behavioural choices. However, in most natural situations rewards are probabilistic and uncertain. Thus investigations into the neurobiological foundations of motivated behaviour should address reward uncertainty. We aim to answer the most basic and important question on reward uncertainty, namely how does the brain take the uncertainty into account when producing optimal decisions?

Objectives: We aim to identify neuronal signals that carry information about risky rewards that is crucial for reward valuation and affects economic choices. We achieve this objective by relating the activity of single neurons in monkeys to normal behaviour in controlled behavioural tasks. We translate the knowledge gained from primate neurophysiology to humans by studying functional magnetic resonance responses (fMRI) in specific human brain structures during comparable behavioural tasks.

Significance: The experiments will systematically advance the knowledge about neuronal reward signals, explore the role of neuronal risk processing in decision-making and formally test a crucial axiom of economic decision theory. The experiments are sufficiently close together to be conceptually tractable and mutually supportive, and sufficiently spread out to cover basic neuronal mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty. The work is based on fundamental concepts of economic choice theory and animal learning theory. The multidisciplinary approach will reveal basic reward risk mechanisms, inform, validate, challenge and select theories of normal behaviour, contribute to the foundations of neuroeconomics and provide necessary knowledge for investigating pathological reward and risk processes in human addiction, gambling and mental disorders."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,466,916</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RNA-MAPS"><Rcn>102472</Rcn><Nid>10371</Nid><HI>Fundacio Centre De Regulacio Genomica, Spain</HI><Name>Uncovering and understanding RNA through Massively Parallel Sequencing</Name><PI>Roderic Guig&#195;&#179;</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The overarching goal of the proposal presented here is the use of massively parallel sequencing for the identification of novel genetic and epigenetic factors playing role in RNA processing. Specifically, we plan to focus on the role of long non-coding RNAs and histone modifications in splicing regulation during cell differentiation. Towards that end, we plan to monitor RNA and chromatin changes across many time points through RNASeq and ChIPSeq in two cell differentiation models: 1) the induced transdifferentiation of human pre-B cells into macrophages, and 2) organ morphogenesis during fly development. By investigating, through these time course experiments, patterns of molecular co-variation&#226;&#128;&#148;for instance, between inclusion levels of alternative exons and histone modifications&#226;&#128;&#148;we can learn how these factors participate, and eventually cooperate, to modulate the condition specific abundance of the alternative splice forms. We plan therefore to develop statistical methods to infer significant patterns of molecular co-variation through the analysis of datasets profiling RNA and chromatin structure across many data points. Based on these findings, we plan to develop a mathematical model of splicing in which the relative abundance of alternative splice forms is predicted from the relevant genetic and epigenetic factors. To facilitate the storage, organization, access, and analysis of the data produced through the project we propose to develop a robust, efficient, and scalable software system. The system will be open source, so that it can be used and enhanced by other researchers.

Early cardiovascular disease can be treated effectively and at ever-lower costs. This has raised hopes that if large groups of individuals who are at an increased risk could be identified earlier, morbidity and mortality from the disease could potentially be reduced. New risk questionnaires, biomarkers and computed tomography imaging technology (CT) have identified undiagnosed increased risks in asymptomatic people. However, it is unknown whether such screening for subclinical disease improves outcomes enough to justify the associated adverse effects and costs of the new strategies.
Benefits are only to be expected if large groups of asymptomatic people can be reached. Moreover, evidence can only be shown unambiguously in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We therefore propose a large-scale population-based screening trial, in which we will invite 330,800 men and women (from population-based registries) to measure their waist circumference and fill out a risk questionnaire. 39,000 persons at elevated risk will then be randomised to either: a) no testing, b) be screened using the classic tests (lipids, glucose, blood pressure) or c) be screened using a CT scan of the coronary arteries. The first objective of the trial is to establish whether inviting (and subsequently selecting high-risk) asymptomatic men and women for a &#226;&#128;&#152;classic&#226;&#128;&#153; risk factor assessment, followed by early and intensive medical intervention in subjects at increased risk, will decrease coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and morbidity by 15% or more within five years. The second objective is to establish whether the coronary calcium score using CT will improve outcomes with another 15% for asymptomatic persons. The third objective is to model the natural history of atherosclerotic plaques and CHD risk, to estimate effects, adverse effects and costs, and to guide public health policies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,298,999</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ROOTS"><Rcn>103542</Rcn><Nid>11418</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Groningen, Netherlands</HI><Name>Role of telomeres and stem cells in ageing</Name><PI>Peter Lansdorp</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The impact of a globally ageing population cannot be overstated. It is expected that by the year 2025 over a billion individuals will be over 60 years of age. In order to develop strategies aimed to restore and maintain function in ageing individuals, a better understanding of the molecular pathways and biological processes that are involved in ageing and age-related disorders is urgently needed. One of the major mechanisms implicated in the decline of tissue function and ageing is the loss of tissue stem cells. This proposal is aimed at developing a better understanding of two fundamental aspects of stem cell biology: the molecular mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and differentiation and the role of telomere attrition and numerical chromosomal abnormalities in stem cell depletion. For both areas we propose to take advantage of recent improvements in DNA sequencing technology. The first area of interest is the role of sister chromatids in parental (stem) cells on gene expression in daughter cells. For such studies we have developed DNA sequencing techniques that allow identification of specific sister chromatids in single daughter cells using parental DNA template strand sequences. Studies in this area will address an aspect of cell biology that has not been subject to direct experimentation before. For studies on the role of telomere attrition and numerical chromosomal abnormalities in ageing we will use material from humans participating in the LifeLines project in Groningen (160,000 individuals) as well as suitable mouse models. Such studies will employ novel single cell sequencing techniques and telomere length measurements. We are specifically interested to measure telomere dysfunction and aneuploidy in stem cells and more differentiated cells, to identify genetic and other factors regulating human leukocyte telomere length and to study the role of telomere attrition in various leukocytes in relation to normal human ageing and pathology."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RUBICAN"><Rcn>102087</Rcn><Nid>10426</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>RNF20 and H2B ubiquitination: linking chromatin dynamics, transcriptional control and cancer</Name><PI>Moshe Oren</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Chromatin modifications play a major role in regulating genome function. Perturbations in such modifications can contribute to neoplastic processes. We will focus on a specific chromatin modification: histone H2B monoubiquitylation. The significance of monoubiquitylated H2B (H2Bub) will be studied by manipulating RNF20, the major E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for H2B ubiquitylation as part of a heteromeric complex with RNF40.
In one major line of research, we will assess the biochemistry of RNF20/H2Bub. The effects of RNF20/H2B on gene expression will be explored through identification of proteins that interact with H2Bub and through in vitro incorporation of H2Bub into nucleosomes. Effects of H2Bub on transcription elongation will be studied by a new high resolution ChIP-seq method (NET-seq). Based on recent ChIP-seq data, we will also explore links between H2B and regulation of splicing. Furthermore, we will investigate the regulatory crosstalk between H2Bub and microRNAs.
The other major line of research will explore the biology of RNF20/H2Bub, with particular emphasis on cancer-related processes. This will be addressed through a combination of cell culture models and mouse models, including constitutive and conditional RNF20 knockout mice. The contribution of RNF20/H2Bub to various differentiation programs, with particular emphasis on embryonic stem cell differentiation, will also be investigated. In addition, we will study the impact of RNF20/H2Bub on NF-kB activity and on inflammatory responses; this will combine in vitro and in vivo systems, with emphasis on inflammation-related cancer. Finally, we will monitor changes in RNF20, RNF40 and H2Bub status in human tumors and investigate underlying mechanisms.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RealLifeCancer"><Rcn>111230</Rcn><Nid>10114</Nid><HI>Academisch Medisch Centrum Bij De Universiteit Van Amsterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Challenging the gaps in global cancer concepts by a real life tumor: human childhood neuroblastoma</Name><PI>Rogier Versteeg</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The successes of cancer research stem from the identification of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes and the study of their pathways in animal and cell line models. Confronting these models with &#226;&#128;&#152;real life&#226;&#128;&#153; human cancer has often been a challenge. This grant aims at integral understanding of the aggressive childhood tumor neuroblastoma. Starting point is a huge database for this tumor. We established mRNA, miRNA, CGH and SNP profiles for a series of neuroblastoma, and sequenced their whole genomes. Over 1500 mRNA profiles of cell lines with manipulated gene expression complete this resource. A novel bioinformatic platform integrated all molecular and clinical data. Several research topics have emerged: (1) Recurrent mutations were detected in neuronal growth cone genes. We will investigate whether failed neuritogenesis is oncogenic; (2) Contrary to the paradigm that cancer is caused by gene mutations, our data suggest that human tumours equally much result from chromosomal gains and losses. They proportionally change the expression of hundreds of otherwise intact genes. We will investigate how copy number changes activate oncogenic pathways. (3) Each neuroblastoma includes two cell types, which at low frequency convert into each other. They differ in mesenchymal and neuro-epithelial character, cancer pathway activation, motility and drug sensitivity and thereby are at the crossroads of cancer stem cell-, drug resistance- and metastasis-research. Transgene expression could induce transitions between both cell types in vitro, which will allow us to elucidate the wiring of both states. (4) Neuroblastoma can go in remission upon treatment, but often relapse as fatal therapy resistant tumour. This plasticity may stem from resistant mesenchymal cells, inter-conversion of cell types and continued chromosomal copy number changes. We will target pathways essential to each cell type to contain plasticity and identify therapeutic options to prepare for clinical testing.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,803</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RegenerateAcross"><Rcn>103814</Rcn><Nid>9258</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Dresden, Germany</HI><Name>A Cross Species Approach to Understand the Mechanism and Evolution of Limb Regeneration Capacity</Name><PI>Elly Margaret Tanaka</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Limb regeneration capacity varies among vertebrates, ranging from full regeneration in salamanders, to stage-restricted premetamorphic regeneration in frogs, to finger-tip regeneration in newborn mice and humans.
The molecular and cellular basis for these differences in regeneration ability is not known and it is still unclear if these different regenerative events are tied by some common mechanisms with progressive restriction due to extracellular signals or cell intrinsic changes.
Connective tissue fibroblasts or their progenitors play a key role in regenerating the patterned salamander limb.  They harbor critical positional information and can reconstitute not only the connective tissue but also a complete, patterned skeleton.  In contrast, such cells typically contribute to scar tissue during mammalian wound healing.  Their role in mouse finger tip regeneration is unknown.
I seek to determine the differences in fibroblast biology that account for the differences in regeneration between salamander, frog and mouse.  To define the differences in composition of the connective tissue population, I will perform parallel lineage tracing of different fibroblast populations and their progenitors during wound healing and regeneration in salamander, frog and mouse.  To determine differences in cell intrinsic potential versus extracellular cues required for regeneration I will perform cross-species transplantation of lineage-labeled cells between salamander and frog coupled with expression profiling to identify molecular changes that occur in cells in a regenerative versus non-regenerative context.  Finally I will use this expression profiling and our molecular knowledge of limb regeneration factors to test whether frog and mouse cells can acquire regenerative traits at the cellular level by the forced exposure to intracellular and extracellular regeneration cues or by the downregulation of putative inhibitory factors.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,447,600</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="RegenerativeTherapy"><Rcn>99939</Rcn><Nid>8887</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Cell and gene therapy approaches for inherited diseases with unsatisfying or no therapeutic option</Name><PI>Marina Cavazzana-Calvo</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We have developed the tools and experimental models and have provided the proof of principle that gene modified autologous haematopoietic stem cells can restore a complete immunological system in vivo in a particular form of SCID. We are pursuing these efforts applying this strategy to several other diseases : two lentivirus protocols for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Thalassemia and sickle cell disease, are developed in our Clinical Investigation Centre. In 2010, we plan to initiate two other gene therapy trials for two primary immunodeficiencies (SCID-X1 and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). Our expertise in translational medicine has now been used to transfer into clinics a new gene therapy protocol for a devastating  inherited skin disease : dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. To complement these approaches, we optimize HLA-mismatched haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). They are an important therapeutic option for children with primary immunodeficiencies but the delayed reconstitution of the T-cell compartment following T-cell depleted HSCT remains a major clinical concern thus drastically limiting its broader clinical application. In order to speed-up the immunological reconstitution in this setting, we try to pre-clinically develop a new approach able to generate a large quantity of T-cellular precursors from a fraction of the donor CD34+ stem cells shortly cultured on Notch delta 4 ligand. This strategy could ideally provide the recipient with a pool of diverse T-cells within the first month after transplantation conferring T-cellular immunity before de novo thymopoiesis takes place.
The results obtained with this procedure are so important that we think to extend its use to the transduction of HSC for the gene therapy trials.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,397,215</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-10-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-09-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="ReproPARK"><Rcn>188504</Rcn><Nid>12198</Nid><HI>Ospedale San Raffaele Srl, Italy</HI><Name>New experimental therapeutic approaches for Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease by direct DA neuronal reprogramming</Name><PI>Vania Broccoli</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Neurodegenerative diseases cause a significant burden on the elderly population in Europe. Parkinson&#226;&#128;&#153;s disease (PD) affects 1.2 million people in Europe and with the increasing life expectancy this number will rise, putting more pressure on health care. Treatment of PD is only symptomatic, and therefore, there is an urgent need for more efficient therapies. Degeneration of mesencephalic DA neurons triggers the initial phases of PD, which raises the concept that cell replacement might represent a long-term restorative option for this neuropathology. Indeed, previous studies in PD patients have indicated that cell therapy has the potential to significantly sustain an enduring symptomatic relief. However, these studies suffered for lacking an ideal source of transplantable human DA neurons. Only recently the generation of induced stem cells (iPSCs) by the reprogramming of somatic cells has disclosed the possibility to generate individual specific neurons with a high therapeutic potential. We have recently developed a methodology that promotes transdifferentiation of mouse and human fibroblasts into functional induced dopaminergic neuronal (iDAN) cells. iDAN cells display sophisticated neuronal properties including pacemaking firing activity, synaptic integration, activity-dependent dopamine release and D2 functional autoreceptors. Therefore, iDAN cells offer an unprecedented cellular source with ideal features for cell therapy in PD, since they can be generated from the patients in high amounts. Here, we propose to strengthen the technology in the human setting and decipher the molecular events. Next, we will elaborate methods of in vivo reprogramming promoting neuronal transdifferentiation locally in the mouse brain. Finally, autologous transplantations of iDAN cells in parkinsonian monkeys will be attempted. Overall, this project will enhance cell reprogramming technologies with the ambition to generate a superior cellular source for transplantations in PD patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,415,767</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Ribogenes"><Rcn>90069</Rcn><Nid>9627</Nid><HI>Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Germany</HI><Name>The role of noncoding RNA in sense and antisense or orientation in epigenetic control of rRNA genes</Name><PI>Ingrid Grummt</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a significant role in the control of gene expression and epigenetic regulation. It seems that ncRNAs might be numerous and highly adapted in roles that require specific nucleic acid recognition without complex catalysis, such as in guiding RNA modifications or in directing post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure. Our previous work has revealed that NoRC, a chromatin remodeling complex that triggers heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing of a fraction of rRNA genes, is associated with 100-250 nt RNAs that originate from the intergenic spacer (IGS) separating rDNA repeats. Furthermore, a fraction of rDNA is transcribed in antisense orientation. Both IGS RNA and antisense transcripts display a growth- and tissue-specific expression pattern. The goal of this project is to decipher the role of NoRC-associated RNA in alterations of chromatin structure and epigenetic control of rDNA. Our research will focus on the synthesis, regulation, and processing of intergenic and antisense transcripts in response to cell growth and differentiation as well as on the role of NoRC-associated RNA in epigenetic regulation of rRNA genes.   The following points will be addressed: (1) Deciphering the mechanism underlying RNA-directed establishment of specific epigenetic marks and formation of silent chromatin domains, (2) Functional analysis of posttranscriptional modifications that regulate RNA binding and NoRC activity, (3) Identification of non-ribosomal target genes of NoRC, and (4) Elucidation of the link between transcriptional activity and active demethylation of the rDNA promoter. Given the fact that basic regulatory principles are conserved throughout evolution, this work will have a great impact on our understanding of RNA-directed silencing mechanisms and will reveal how epigenetic defects cause human diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>831,756</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Rubinet"><Rcn>98839</Rcn><Nid>11429</Nid><HI>Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Regulation of cell growth and division by selective degradation mechanisms</Name><PI>Matthias Peter</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Cell growth and division are tightly regulated by phosphorylation and selective degradation of cellular components. Whereas autophagy is mainly responsible to eliminate long-lived proteins and organelles, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) rapidly degrades proteins when fast adaptation is needed. Defects in these degradation systems accounts for numerous human diseases, including cancer, muscle dystrophies, viral and bacterial infections and neurodegeneration. While rapid progress has been made in the identification of UPS and autophagy components, little is known about their regulation and the molecular mechanisms that ensure substrate specificity. We therefore propose an interdisciplinary combination of biochemistry, cell and structural biology, genetics, RNAi-screening, quantitative microscopy and microfluidic technology to tackle these questions in yeast and mammalian cells.
E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes are important UPS components that specifically bind substrates via dedicated adaptors. In particular, cullin-based E3-ligases control cell growth and division, but much needs to be learned about their regulation and the identity and function of their key substrates. Moreover, we uncovered a function of RING-H2 E3-ligases in MAP-kinase networks, providing a new link between phosphorylation and the UPS. Finally, while autophagy can selectively remove protein aggregates and damaged or excess organelles, the underlying mechanisms that provide specificity to this process are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that ubiquitin may also serve as a recognition signal for selective autophagy. We will thus investigate the roles of ubiquitin and specific autophagy substrate-adaptors, and focus on the molecular crosstalk between selective autophagy and the UPS.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,426,976</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SABIP"><Rcn>89301</Rcn><Nid>9195</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Oxford, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Silks as Biomimetic Ideals for Polymers: SABIP</Name><PI>Fritz Vollrath</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Silk offers an attractive combination of strength and toughness coupled with environmentally benign processing and degradation.

Currently, the only high resolution crystal structures available for the ribosome functional complexes are bacterial ribosomes containing mRNA, tRNAs in E, P and A sites and several translation factors. Recently, we have determined at medium resolution the first eukaryotic ribosome structure.  Saccharomyces cerevisaiae ribosomes have been chosen for the first step of the study because they have been extensively investigated in our laboratory by biochemical methods and by x-ray analysis.
Step One: We will improve the quality of the crystals and determine the ribosome structure of yeast at atomic resolution (about 3&#195;&#133; resolution). These conditions will be used for an investigation of the ribosome functional complexes in order to better understand the detailed mechanism of the translocation of large molecules (tRNA and mRNA) on the ribosome.
Step Two: Ribosomes from human HeLa cells will be investigated via crystallization and x-ray structure determination. Ribosome functional complexes developed on yeast systems will be used as models for the creation and structural investigation of human ribosome complexes. Available biochemical data will provide a framework for the interpretation of structural information which will be obtained.
The aims:
To determine the atomic resolution crystal structure of the yeast ribosome as a model for all eukaryotic ribosome x-ray studies.
To obtain crystals and determine the structure of 80S ribosome from HeLa cells.
To determine the structure of the ribosome complexes with mRNA and tRNA in ratcheted and non-ratcheted states in order to describe the mechanism of translocation.
To determine structure of the ribosome initiation complex with an internal ribosomal entry site mRNA.
To obtain crystals and to determine the structures of 40S initiation complexes."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,466,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SCG"><Rcn>91132</Rcn><Nid>9793</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Systematic Chemical Genetic Interrogation of Biological Networks</Name><PI>Michael David Tyers</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Recent genome-scale studies have revealed the massive redundancies and functional interconnectivities encoded by the genome. For example, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is predicted to harbor 200,000 synthetic lethal interactions. This genetic density has profound implications for both understanding the architecture of living systems and drug discovery. In particular, the dense connections of biological networks mandate a multi-node strategy to selectively manipulate any given biological response, whether it be to probe system level properties or for therapeutic intervention in human disease. By analogy to Ehrlich s  magic bullet  concept, we term this approach the  magic shotgun . We propose to systematically identify chemical-genetic interactions that selectively disrupt any specific mutant genotype and chemical-chemical interactions that selectively kill pathogenic species.

It is usually related with age and is one of the leading causes of blindness. The increase in light scatter in the lens reduces the contrast in the retinal images severely degrading vision. The current solution is to perform surgery to remove the natural lens that is substituted by an artificial intraocular lens. This is a successful procedure restoring good quality of vision in most patients. However, in many situations it would be incredible advantageous to actually &#226;&#128;&#156;see&#226;&#128;&#157; through a cataractous eye. The optics of the eye is affected by two factors: aberrations and scatter. In the last decade, correcting optical aberrations in the eye was accomplished by using adaptive optics techniques. This permitted to obtain high resolution images of the retina and also to improve vision. However, the possibility of correcting scatter in the eye was never considered before. We propose here the use of spatial and temporal advanced photonics techniques for imaging through the turbid media of the cataractous lens. We envision two direct applications of this technology: a dedicated fundus camera to register images of the retina in patients affected by cataracts and a novel type of opto-electronics spectacles restoring some vision in cataract patients. The fundus camera would offer clinicians the unique opportunity to determine if there is any retinal pathology underneath the cataractous eye. The scatter-correcting goggles would be useful in those cases where surgery were not possible for any reason or as a temporarily relieve until the surgery is performed. The same type of technology could be applied in the case of normal eyes with lower levels of scatter but desiring to achieve a better than normal vision for some specific tasks.

In these children, obesity is a primary indicator for development of type 2 diabetes and possibly cancer. I present a research program, SELECTionPREDISPOSED, to identify novel obesity-risk genes as tools for detection of early childhood obesity making possible a selective prevention program in predisposed children. I will use records and blood samples from children and their parents in the Mother-Child Cohort of Norway, the Health Survey of Nord-Tr&#195;&#184;ndelag and the Norwegian Birth Registry and cross-correlate the databases for genetic research. I hypothesize that children large at birth with enhanced infantile growth may be predisposed to obesity by genetic factors. Obesity-linked genes are likely to include a mix of variants associated with glucose, insulin and fat metabolism and may be identifiable in population studies using biobanks and end-point registries. The state-of-the-art approach is to identify diabetes- or obesity-associated genes in subjects with disease. My approach is to investigate subsets of children with high and low birth weights and BMIs at age six. Using cutting-edge genetic techniques like GWAS, copy-number variation and massive parallel exome and epigenome sequencing I will correlate the genetic information with clinical data in large national end-point registries by a case-control design subsequent replication in large data sets and control for environmental confounders by cross-correlation to the national birth registry. I want to change the field by working with predisposed children in order to influence the ratio between those that may and may not develop obesity and diabetes. In this way my team will develop contextual tools of a groundbreaking nature.

During T cell development a highly diverse T cell receptor repertoire is probed against a matching array of self-antigens. While the generation of the T cell receptor repertoire relies on unique genetic recombination mechanisms, the corresponding molecular principles underlying the generation of TCR ligands - self-peptide/MHC complexes - are less well understood; recent data indicate that novel principles of epigenetic control are employed. This proposal aims at understanding a unique feature of thymic epithelial cells (TECs), namely the expression of a multitude of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), a phenomenon termed promiscuous gene expression (pGE) in the context of self-tolerance. The integrative approach of this proposal has 4 main objectives (i) a characterization of the molecular control of different pools of pGE beyond the role of the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) in relation to the developmental biology of TECs (ii) a comprehensive and comparative analysis of expression patterns of TRAs in single cells of different species in relation to epigenetic signatures and higher chromatin order, (iii) translating these findings to the cellular dynamics and topology of the thymic medullary compartment, e.g. individual mTEC clones in situ (iv) the modelling of these different levels of analysis by a system biology approach, e.g. testing our hypothesis that clusters of TRAs in the genome represent an &#226;&#128;&#156;operational unit&#226;&#128;&#157; of pGE. We expect from these studies new basic insights into a fascinating and still arcane aspect of the vertebrate immune system, which will also contribute to our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of human autoimmune diseases.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,014,560</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SELFCC"><Rcn>107063</Rcn><Nid>10886</Nid><HI>University Of Dundee, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Chromosome self-clearing completes sister chromatid separation</Name><PI>Tomoyuki Tanaka</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"In this research program, we propose the new concept that sister chromatid separation in mitosis is completed as a result of the dynamic intrinsic structural changes of chromosomes, i.e. through cycles of regional chromosome stretching and recoiling, which we call the self-clearing mechanism of chromosomes. By developing several novel methods, we will establish this new concept and demonstrate that the self-clearing of chromosomes is an essential mechanism allowing complete removal of sister chromatid cohesion, and that it is a fundamentally conserved function from yeast to vertebrates. To maintain genetic integrity, eukaryotic cells must duplicate their chromosomes and subsequently segregate them to opposite poles of the cell, prior to cell division. Cohesion is established between sister chromatids during S phase and marks sister pairs to ensure proper chromosome segregation in the next mitosis. However, the cohesion must be eventually removed to allow sister chromatids to separate and segregate to opposite poles. Although recent studies have revealed how the removal of cohesion is initiated, it is still elusive how this removal is completed. Our project will address mechanisms promoting this process and will open up a new direction of research, regarding dynamic chromosome organization, in particular its compaction and condensation. At present, the structural basis for chromosome compaction and condensation is poorly understood. Our project will shed new light on this inscrutable scientific problem by revealing the process of chromosome self-clearing. The outcome of our research will give important clues to fundamental mechanisms for chromosome segregation and will contribute to our understanding of human diseases, such as cancer and congenital disorders, which are characterized by chromosome instability and aneuploidy."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,490,464</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SENSORIMOTOR"><Rcn>103283</Rcn><Nid>9937</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>Synaptic Mechanisms of Cortical Sensorimotor Integration</Name><PI>Carl Christian Holger Petersen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Animals actively acquire sensory information. Incoming sensory signals must therefore be processed in the context of self-generated motor commands in order to generate useful sensory percepts. Equally, sensory information is an essential guide during movement. The neuronal circuits and synaptic mechanisms underlying sensorimotor integration in the mammalian brain are currently poorly understood.
The mouse whisker sensorimotor system is developing into a useful model for studying active sensory perception offering the possibility for causal and mechanistic insight into the molecular, synaptic, cellular and network functions underlying simple sensorimotor behaviors. Utilizing cutting edge technology, here I propose a concerted experimental research program, which will provide data on fundamental aspects of cortical function during active whisker sensory perception:
1. Functional mapping of the mouse sensorimotor cortex through combination of optogenetics to control cortical activity and optical imaging to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical activity in awake mice during execution of object localisation and texture discrimination tasks.
2. Two-photon targeted whole-cell recordings and optogenetic manipulation will be used to explore the role of specific classes of excitatory neocortical neurons with identified long-range axonal projections during execution of object localisation and texture discrimination tasks.
3. The roles of genetically-defined classes of neocortical GABAergic neurons during these whisker-dependent tasks will be explored through combination of optogenetics and two-photon targeted whole-cell recordings.
Together these investigations will define key organising principles for the functional operation of cortical circuits involved in active whisker sensory perception. Such a causal and mechanistic description of simple mammalian sensorimotor behaviors will form an essential step towards investigating mouse models of human brain diseases."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,340,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SERRACO"><Rcn>102469</Rcn><Nid>12518</Nid><HI>Institute Of Experimental Medicine - Hungarian Academy Of Sciences, Hungary</HI><Name>Modulation of cortical activity by median raphe neuronal assemblies with identified behavioural effects</Name><PI>Tam&#195;&#161;s Freund</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Cortical operations are built up from states associated with distinct behaviour-dependent network activity patterns that subserve information aquisition, encoding, memory consolidation and retrieval. Thus, they can be considered as manifestations of different processing modes. Groups of modulatory, largely monoaminergic neurons located in subcortical nuclei innervating all forebrain areas are indispensable for the generation, stabilization and termination of cortical activity states. In recent years the concept of subcortical modulation has been expanded by the discovery of a fast type of modulatory action driving the rapid readjustment of cortical activity and associated behaviours. Thus, cortical networks are under the influence of a tonic, slow, as well as a phasic, rapid component of subcortical modulation that are acting in parallel. Results from our laboratory revealed that the median raphe (MR) nucleus, one of the main sources of serotonergic innervation of the limbic system , besides the non-synaptic diffuse action, also exerts a fast type of modulation via the selective innervation of cortical GABAergic interneurons. This selective effect on local inhibition may be ideal for the synchronous resetting of the target principal cell circuits, or for the continuous tuning of their activity. These discoveries, together with the methodological advances of recent years, enable us to map the neuronal network mechanisms behind transitions of brain states, as well as associated behaviours, induced by subcortical inputs. We will focus on the MR &#226;&#128;&#147; limbic connection with the aim to unravel the physiological, pharmacological and anatomical features of MR neuronal assemblies, both the slow- and fast-acting, as well as the serotonergic and glutamatergic components (together with their cortical target circuits) that will have been shown - using optic stimulation of ChR2/eGFP virus-infected MR neurons - to evoke characteristic behaviours, such as anxiety and conditioned fear."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,700,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SET-NET"><Rcn>102090</Rcn><Nid>10424</Nid><HI>Biomedical Sciences Research Center Alexander Fleming, Greece</HI><Name>Enzymatic and genomic targets of histone modifying enzymes and their role in liver metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis</Name><PI>Ioannis Talianidis</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"In this proposal we will study the role of histone methytransferases Set9, PR-SET7, Smyd2, Smyd3 and the demethylase LSD1 in hepatocarcinogenesis and in the regulation of hepatic metabolic pathways.
The hypothesis raised here suggests that the function of histone modifying enzymes is realized through 4 overlapping regulatory layers: i. via modifications of chromatin, ii. via modifications of recently identified transcription factor substrates, iii. via influencing the hepatic transcription factor crossregulatory circuitry, and iv. via modification of each other.
To dissect the role of these regulatory layers and determine their contribution in the control of hepatic metabolic pathways, and in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, our activities will involve: i. Generation of relevant KO and transgenic mouse models, ii. Functional characterization of novel non-histone and histone substrates, iii. Analysis of novel cross-regulatory protein modifications affecting the activity of the enzymes and iv. the identification of their genomic targets and associated chromatin modifications using global approaches.
The work is expected to provide important insights into a previously unanticipated network of protein methylation-directed regulatory modules, potentially operating in multiple biological pathways such as liver development, metabolism, apoptosis and carcinogenesis.

In the post-genomic era, one would expect that the discovery and the optimization of the gene networks controlling key agronomic traits could contribute to another level of yield improvement. In this scenario, leader alleles will be identified and combined to produce new plant prototypes.

Our proposal aims to investigate unisexual flowers development and parthenocarpy in Cucurbitaceae species and to produce new plant prototypes adapted to specific growing conditions. The rationale behind choosing plants from this family as a model system is justified by the widespread of sex morphs and the major role of many species of this family in food security.

Our recent work on sex determination which led to the isolation of the first naturally occurring sex determination genes in plants, has set the ground for this project. The proposal relies on integrative analyses of datasets that will be obtained from the combination of different &#226;&#128;&#156;omics&#226;&#128;&#157; and genetic tools. Specific objectives include the (i) Determination of the gene networks controlling unisexual flower development and fruit shape, (ii) Comparative analysis of the sex genes in Cucurbitaceae species of different sexual morphs (iii) Determination of the gene networks controlling parthenocarpy and (iv) Production of new plant prototypes of major and orphan cucurbits and detailed phenotyping for yield. Outcomes will be transferred to the major Cucurbitaceae, melon, watermelon, cucumber and zucchini, as well as the orphan crop, bottle gourd.

Integrins are ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric adhesion receptors consisting of &#206;&#177; and &#206;&#178; subunits. They exhibit two striking properties; they can regulate their affinity for ligands and assemble large signalling hubs called adhesomes. Both properties depend on the &#206;&#177; and &#206;&#178; cytoplasmic tails; when integrins switch from inactive to active conformations their weakly associated tails separate and recruit adhesion proteins leading to adhesome assembly. How active integrins revert to the inactive state, and how the weak &#206;&#177;/&#206;&#178; tail association is maintained is largely unknown. The mechanistic contribution of individual integrin classes to the recruitment of proteins to the adhesome and how adhesome signalling is induced is also unclear. In this proposal we will address these fundamental questions in 4 specific aims. In the first aim we will identify proteins that keep integrin tails associated and define the roles of their tail binding with respect to integrin inactivation and turn over. In the second aim we will utilize high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry to define how different integrins assemble adhesomes with common and specific components that signal in highly regulated manners. Our third aim will determine how integrin tails nucleate an adhesion complex that expedites further interactions with multiple binding partners by performing crosslinking proteomics of adhesion proteins bound to different &#206;&#178; integrin tails in vitro. In the fourth aim we will use genetically engineered mice to determine how ubiquitously expressed proteins of the adhesome perform organ- and cell type-specific functions. Completion of these aims will help define the fundamental mechanisms whereby integrins control their complex signalling networks.

For this purpose, synaptically connected pairs of molecular layer interneurons will be studied in cerebellar slices. Presynaptic calcium transients will be elicited at individual presumptive presynaptic release sites using targeted photorelease of the calcium precursor DM-nitrophen. Using this new approach several questions will be addressed including the degree of postsynaptic receptor saturation, the size and nature of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, and kinetics of vesicle recycling.
This approach will be first developed for the GABAergic synapses between interneurons but will be later extended to study the glutamatergic synapses between granule cells and interneurons.
Next we shall develop methods to selectively activate presynaptic ionotropic receptors by localized photolysis of precursors of neurotransmitters, while recording either the resulting current or the resulting calcium signal. In this manner we shall investigate, at the single site level, the presence and functional properties of presynaptic GABAA and glutamate receptors.
Finally we will investigate the functional significance of presynaptic receptor signaling in vivo by using calcium imaging with genetically targeted calcium indicators. Using appropriate stimulation protocols we will determine whether these receptors can be activated either via autocrine or paracrine release of neurotransmitters."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,480</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SMI-DDR"><Rcn>98949</Rcn><Nid>11843</Nid><HI>University Of Sussex, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Single Molecule Imaging of the DNA Damage Response in Live Cells</Name><PI>Antony Carr</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Accurate DNA replication is key to maintaining genomic stability. Replication is immensely complex requiring error-free duplication of several billion bases each time a human cell divides. The DNA replication machinery must deal with a wide range of DNA damage, aberrant secondary structures and DNA:protein complexes; obstacles that cause replication forks to arrest. Arrested replication complexes are actively stabilised by checkpoint pathways, but in some cases component proteins still dissociate from the site of DNA incorporation, resulting in fork &#194;&#191;collapse&#194;&#191;. Collapsed forks can be restarted by homologous recombination (HR)-based processes, but are strongly associated with gross chromosomal rearrangements. Thus, the advantage gained by restarting a collapsed fork comes at the expense of an increased potential for genome instability.
Structural, biochemical, and molecular techniques identified the main components and regulators of these processes, but are inherently limited to studying the system in bulk, thereby averaging events and limiting our understanding of the dynamics and behaviour of molecular participants.

Its diversion towards the wrong targets is involved in human conditions ranging from drug addiction to pathological gambling and obesity. Incentive learning has been studied from a behavioral standpoint and only few of the underlying molecular mechanisms have been identified. We propose innovative approaches to characterize at the molecular and cellular level incentive memory traces , i.e. stable alterations in identified neuronal populations. We focus on the striatum, a brain region crucial for incentive learning, where dopamine encodes reward-related signals. Dopamine controls the flow of information through glutamatergic synapses and its long-lasting adaptations. It regulates the balance between striatal output pathways, which underlies action selection , i.e. behavioral choices in response to a given combination of internal state and external cues and context. We will address two important issues: What are the signaling mechanisms involved in the formation and reconsolidation of incentive memory traces induced by DA and glutamate? In which neuronal populations are these traces formed and what are their time-dependent modifications? The program uses a variety of approaches including novel mouse genetic models and approaches for visualizing striatal neurons in vivo. If successful, these methods have a strong potential for more general applicability.

The central thesis of this application is that our understanding of evolution and ecology is restricted by a failure to consider organisms in their social context. Novel analytical and technical approaches now enable a new generation of studies of organisms in their proper social context, and the quantification of the effects of social interactions. This proposal s central objective is to understand the dependence of a series of ecological processes on the social behaviour of interacting organisms, using replicate populations of model organisms for field population biology, tits (Parus). The research has four major aims: (1) To understand the causes and consequences of variation in social behaviour, using both individual (nodal) and population (network) approaches; (2) to conduct quantitative and molecular genetic analyses of social phenotypes, in particular considering the role of indirect genetic effects on both social and non-social phenotypes; (3) to conduct experimental manipulations, at a range of scales, of the social environment of individuals, and hence test their effect on population structure and dispersal; (4) to combine these approaches to understand how social interactions modulate the processes of dispersal and natural selection, and how they contribute to explaining fitness variance in these species. This combined approach, applied to one of the best studied populations of vertebrates in the world, will lead to major advances in our understanding of the determinants and forces acting on sociality, and in our understanding of the importance of social behaviour in modulating key ecological and evolutionary processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,485,013</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPATIALDYNAMICS"><Rcn>89170</Rcn><Nid>9851</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Ecological, molecular, and evolutionary spatial dynamics</Name><PI>Ilkka Aulis Hanski</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The study of wild populations will benefit of increasing integration of ecological, molecular, genetic, and evolutionary approaches. The Glanville fritillary butterfly has a classic metapopulation in a network of 4,000 habitat patches in the &#195;&#133;land Islands, Finland, within an area of 50 by 70 km, across which population surveys have been conducted since 1993. Taking advantage of the opportunity to sample a few larvae from full-sib groups of gregarious larvae in hundreds of local populations, this project involves large-scale phenotyping and genotyping of individuals across the large metapopulation. The aim is to advance our general understanding of the genetic basis of variation in individual performance and life-time reproductive success (fitness), and the role of ongoing natural selection in population dynamics of species living in fragmented landscapes. For genotyping, we select ~1,000 SNPs from annotated genes in the recently sequenced transcriptome of this species. The same SNPs will be used to construct a pedigree for the entire metapopulation for 4 years. Two broad questions will be addressed:   (1) Genetic basis of variation in dispersal, related life-history traits, and life-time reproductive success. This will be studied with association analyses, correlating individual phenotypes and genotypes to identify molecular variation with consequences for individual performance and fitness; and with pedigree analyses of natural populations, relating life-time reproductive success of individual larval groups to their phenotypic and genotypic composition.   (2) Spatio-temporal population dynamics, the role of ongoing natural selection and consequences for regional adaptation. The purpose is to investigate the causes and consequences of spatio-temporal variation in population dynamics, including the role of ongoing natural selection.

The broad objective of our project is to understand the relative importance of processes and factors that govern the composition and dynamics of species-rich communities. Advances in this issue have important implications for efforts to protect terrestrial biodiversity from climate and land use change. Surprisingly, although most processes which are thought to contribute to species coexistence have a strong spatial component, the rich source of information on spatial patterns has not been used. To accomplish our goal, we take a radically different approach than previous attempts and adopt a spatially explicit perspective that will allow us to take significant steps towards a Unified Spatial Theory of Biodiversity. We use the best data sets available, i.e., 25-50 ha mega-plots of tropical forests each comprising several hundred of species and &gt;100000 trees that are monitored and censuses every 5 years. We proceed in three steps. (1) We quantify the highly complex spatial structures found in these forests using state-of-the-art techniques in spatial pattern analysis. (2) We build a range of individual-based spatially-explicit simulation models ranging from  pure  neutral models to detailed process-based models of tropical forest, such as FORMIND. (3) We use pattern-oriented modelling to confront these simulation models with the set of patterns identified in (1) to identify the most parsimonious models that account simultaneously for all (spatial) patterns. We anticipate that the new spatial perspective and innovative computer modelling techniques will allow for a major break through in this important challenge at the frontier of ecological research, and open up new horizons for understanding and conservation of biodiversity.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,177,664</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SPATONC"><Rcn>106863</Rcn><Nid>9571</Nid><HI>Max Planck Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Wissenschaften E.v., Germany</HI><Name>Systems analysis of pancreatic tumor cell phenotype dependence on the spatial regulation of oncogenic Ras signaling</Name><PI>Philippe Igor Henri Bastiaens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Over the last several years me and my team have uncovered the reaction cycles that dynamically maintain the spatial organization of the Ras proto-oncogene products on cellular membranes.

Plants may shift their ranges independent of their co-evolved aboveground and belowground biota, however little is known about how these communities re-assemble in the new range and how that process influences community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Thus far, predictions on species occurrences have been based exclusively on how niche conditions shift to higher latitudes and altitudes. Here, I will make the next step towards predicting how terrestrial systems respond to climate warming by evaluating interactions between plants, aboveground and belowground multi-trophic communities in the original and new ranges. My overall aim is to determine how aboveground and belowground multi-trophic level communities become disjointed and concomitantly re-assembled during plant range shifts. I will determine consequences for community dynamics and ecosystem functioning in the new range. My overall hypothesis is that due to time-lags in range shifts between plants, and their aboveground and belowground biota, novel communities may develop in the new range that will alter functioning of ecosystems, their stability and resilience. I will study range shifting plant species and determine: 1) aboveground-belowground multi-trophic community composition, 2) specificity of soil-borne pathogens and root-feeding nematodes, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and decomposer organisms, 3) bottom-up and top-down control of these biota by soil communities, and 4) dynamics, stability and resilience of original and novel communities and ecosystem functions under current and future climate conditions.

The design principles underlying the dynamic organisation and function of the microtubule cytoskeleton are not understood. Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we will determine the rules that govern which combination of mechano-chemical elements gives rise to specific large-scale organisation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. We will reconstitute the architecture of bipolar spindles that are essential for the segregation of the genetic material during cell division. For the in vitro reconstitutions, we will use candidate proteins suggested to be crucial by the literature and we will identify as yet unknown proteins with critical activities. We will investigate key fundamental questions: In which region of the multidimensional biochemical parameter space is bipolarity encoded, which is essential for successful cell division? What are the molecular mechanisms that determine size scaling of spindles or of spindle substructures? How do chromosomes position themselves correctly within spindles and how are spindles positioned properly within cells? To validate that the answers obtained from our in vitro reconstitutions are also applicable to the cytoskeleton in vivo, the reconstituted systems will be quantitatively compared to living cells at the global and single molecule level. The results of our experiments will develop theoretical models of cytoskeleton architecture and function. The overall goal of the project is to understand at a mechanistic level how the self-organised architecture of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and its collective dynamic and mechanical properties, derive from the complex interplay between its mechano-chemical constituents.

Our recent studies have addressed the molecular basis for transformation and demonstrated the essential role of sumoylation of the PML moiety of PML/RARA, relaxed DNA-binding specificity, binding to RXRA, for both transcriptional repression and transformation in primary cells, uncovering an unexpected level of complexity for in vivo transformation. We have also explored PML nuclear bodies (NB) formation, enigmatic structures that are disrupted by PML/RARA expression, restored by either RA or arsenic and may thus contribute to transformation/response. Exploring the actual basis for therapy response, we have provide some evidence that PML/RARA degradation and loss of leukaemia-initiating cells, rather than differentiation, is key to APL clearance.
We propose to address the following issues: i) genetically uncouple differentiation from APL eradication ii) model transformation and therapy response iii) analyse the regulation and role of PML NBs iv) explore other models where degradation of the driving oncogene may eradicate the disease through loss of LIC activity.
These studies should not only provide a complete model for APL pathogenesis and treatment response, but also open new avenues in the field of PML nuclear body biogenesis and function, as well as transcriptional activation/degradation coupling. The proposed research could provide generally applicable strategies for a variety of malignancies that are similarly driven by fusion proteins. As previously, in the APL and Adult T cell leukaemia models, our studies could also yield new directly clinically applicable therapeutic strategies."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STEMCARDIOVASC"><Rcn>110774</Rcn><Nid>10184</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>Human Pluripotent Stem Cells: the new heart patient?</Name><PI>Christine Lindsay Mummery</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The ability to generate pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by reprogramming somatic tissues is arguably the greatest breakthrough in biomedical science of the last decade.

Identification and subsequent study of such adult stem cells depends strictly on the availability of molecular markers. To date, a paucity of single definitive markers has complicated the study of the biology of these rare cells. Our interest in the role of the Wnt pathway in intestinal homeostasis and cancer has led us to exhaustively define the Wnt target gene program shared between these two processes. Within this program, the cell surface receptor-encoding Lgr5 represented a candidate stem cell marker for the intestine. The creation of Lgr5-genetic mouse models subsequently allowed us to definitively identify the Lgr5+ cells as the intestinal stem cells. These stem cells divide every day, yet persist throughout life. Using the same mouse models, we have found that Lgr5 marks stem cells in a variety of other tissues. For two family members with similarly restricted expression domains, Lgr4 and -6, comparable genetic tools have been generated. In this proposal, I aim to exploit these unique genetic tools to study primary adult stem cells in health and disease. This should allow us to outline unique and common characteristics of individual stem cell types, and  possibly- define the minimum molecular determinants of stemness. Specifically, I aim: 1. To make a complete inventory of adult stem cells expressing Lgr4, Lgr5 and/or Lgr6 using the transgenic mouse models. 2. To FACS-purify stem cells from selected tissues, and detail their molecular and metabolic characteristics. 3. To genetically define the biological role of the Lgr-family receptors in adult stem cells by gene knockout. 4. To translate these findings to the equivalent human tissues using antibody-based histology and FACS technology. 5. To explore the usefulness of the Lgr proteins as markers of cancer stem cells in human solid tumors.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,106,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STEMRD"><Rcn>110795</Rcn><Nid>10177</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Generation of stem cell derived photoreceptors for the treatment and modelling of retinal degeneration</Name><PI>Robin Raihan Ali</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"Retinal degenerations leading to loss of photoreceptors are a major cause of untreatable blindness in the EU. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 1 in 10 people over 60 yrs. Currently no treatments restore lost photoreceptor cells and visual function and thus there is a need for new therapeutic approaches. We have shown previously that transplantation of rod precursor cells at a specific stage of development results in integration and differentiation into rod photoreceptors (Nature, 2006) and that this can improve vision in mouse models of visual dysfunction (Nature, 2012). These studies provide proof-of-concept for effective transplantation of neurons and the basis for ES cell-derived photoreceptor transplantation. Importantly, these results are only achieved using photoreceptor precursor cells that are specified to differentiate into photoreceptors, but are not mature photoreceptors at the time of transplantation. The objective of this proposal is to determine if ES/iPS cell-derived photoreceptors can be utilised as a therapeutic source of cells to repair the degenerate retina and to model photoreceptor disorders. We will build on our achievements in the field of donor photoreceptor cell transplantation and determine if mouse and human ES cells have the potential to provide an efficient source of rod photoreceptor precursors for restoring vision. A key requirement for the development of retinal stem cell therapy is effective generation and transplantation of ES-derived cone photoreceptor precursors. We will modulate differentiation pathways in order to enrich for cone precursors and investigate their ability to restore visual responses in animal models of cone dysfunction. Finally, we will develop protocols for generating mature photoreceptor cells with outer segments from human iPS cells in order to model photoreceptor disease."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,438,482</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-11-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-10-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STEMRENEWAL"><Rcn>89858</Rcn><Nid>11882</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>Identification of a new mechanism of stem cell self-renewal; direct implications on self-repair and tumor initiating cells in the brain</Name><PI>Patrik Ernfors</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The self-renewing nature of stem cells is a consequence of their ability to proliferate indefinitely while maintaining pluripotency. Mechanisms of pluripotency are well known but mechanisms controlling stem cell proliferation are unknown. Proliferation of somatic cells takes place in G1 cell cycle phase. We have identified that embryonic and peripheral neural stem cell proliferation is regulated by an entirely new mechanism involving chromatin remodeling and operating in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle (Andang et al., Nature 2009). This involves the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway proteins. The DDR pathway is activated physiologically by GABA acting by the GABAA receptor leading to Cl- influx, cell swelling, and by unknown mechanism, activation of the PI3K related kinases ATR/ATM which phosphorylates histone H2AX. Combined, the data suggests that the DDR pathway is operating in a ligand-dependent manner under normal physiological conditions and that it may serve as a new molecular mechanism regulating cell proliferation in eukaryotic cells. We propose a homeostatic mechanism of stem cell proliferation where negative feedback control of the cell cycle adjusts stem cell numbers. The demonstration of normal, physiological, ligand-induced activation of these pathways in stem cell niches opens fundamentally new insight into the mechanisms of stem cell proliferation and surveillance against cancer. Once characterized, we propose that these mechanisms may be exploited to induce self repair following brain damage and to manipulate cell survival in tumor initiating cells of the brain (that share many characteristics with stem cells). The potential benefit of this proposed research could be vast, involving potentially a unifying mechanism how all stem cell niches in the embryo and in the adult individual is regulated and can be manipulated."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,492,593</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STEPS"><Rcn>107501</Rcn><Nid>9505</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Padova, Italy</HI><Name>Signalling compartmentalization and vesicle Trafficking at the Phagocytic Synapses</Name><PI>Antonella Viola</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>A key feature of the immune response is its specificity and macrophages must be able to discriminate precisely between an infectious stimulus and a non-infectious one and tune their response in accordance with the molecular context in which the target particle is recognized. In recent years, scientists have proposed the concept of the phagocytic synapse, to stress the fact that a particle does not engage only one receptor on the cell surface; instead, an array of receptors interacts with a specific pathogen, either sequentially or simultaneously. Indeed, the tightly controlled and specific responses of macrophages require the establishing of checkpoints for signalling and the phagocytic synapse represent an exquisite site for cross-talk among several signalling pathways. Although we can describe detailed signalling pathways for most of the single receptors acting at the phagocytic synapse, we still do not know how these pathways are integrated during the various phases of macrophage responses. An integrated view of phagocytic synapse signalling would allow us to understand the contribution of each ligand-receptor pair to macrophage dysfunctions in pathology and to design novel immunotherapeutic strategies.
The aim of STePS is to provide a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions leading to the orchestration of phagocytic synapses for phagocytosis and activation, two events crucial for immune responses to pathogens as well as for inflammation. In particular, we will focus on three fundamental aspects that bring together the fields of immunology and cell biology: establishment of dynamic platforms for recognition and signalling at the plasma membrane; vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane; signalling compartmentalization for specific cell functions. Importantly, these mechanisms will be analyzed in the context of physiological and pathological conditions, thus providing answers to both basic and translational biomedical research questions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,350,342</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="STOCHPOP"><Rcn>98687</Rcn><Nid>11844</Nid><HI>Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet Ntnu, Norway</HI><Name>Stochastic Population Biology in a Fluctuating Environment</Name><PI>Bernt-Erik S&#195;&#166;ther</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of this project is to produce a new synthesis integrating ecological and evolutionary processes. This synthetic approach is based on the fundamental premise that the effects of environmental stochasticity are essential for the understanding of biological processes at every time scale because all natural populations are exposed to a fluctuating environment. Following my recent advances in the development of stochastic population models I will in this proposal address three questions. First, I will examine to whether the ecological effects of a fluctuating environment can be predicted from some basic set of characters distributing species along a slow-fast continuum of life history variation. Secondly, I will using my own long-term study systems partition selection on fitness-related traits into different hierarchical components, which all must be estimated for predicting the rate of evolutionary changes in quantitative characters. Thirdly, I will examine to what extent using a comparative approach how the strength of fluctuating selection caused by environmental change is predictable from basic life history characteristics. I expect that any emerging patterns arising from the evaluation of these hypotheses will represent a major break-through in evolutionary biology because it will enable identification of general principles and processes that affect the rate of change of populations both at ecological and evolutionary time scales and hence provide tools for development of quantitative predictions for the expected rate of Darwinian evolution in fluctuating environments.

Candida frequently causes oral and vaginal thrush, and life-threatening infections in intensive care patients. These infections drain European finances through lost working days and extended patient hospitalization. A major goal is to understand how this fungus interacts with its human host and how these interactions contribute to pathogenesis. This will enhance efforts to develop accurate diagnostics for systemic candidiasis. Candida pathogenomics has advanced rapidly in the last decade. Nevertheless, our understanding of fungus-host interactions remains rudimentary. Therefore, our Grand Challenge is to exploit advanced new tools to accurately capture the spatial and temporal regulation of fungal molecular responses in lesions during disease progression. My laboratory is uniquely placed to address this challenge using a powerful combination of new, state-of-the-art technologies. Laser capture microscopy, ultrasensitive microarray technologies and 2D-MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry will be used to define the C. albicans transcriptome and infectome, both spatially and temporally, across fungal lesions during disease progression. C. albicans infections will be imaged with a novel ultrasensitive reporter to confirm the dynamic regulation of specific cellular processes during disease progression. Then precise molecular tools will be used to establish the relative contributions of these processes to the infection process, and to explore candidate diagnostic targets identified during this programme.

Legionella utilizes a type IV secretion system, encoded by the dot/icm gene cluster, to secrete circa 300 effectors that highjack host cellular function to allow the bacterium to live intracellularly inside macrophages. Although the molecular basis of effector function has been elucidated for a small number of effectors, there remain a large number of effectors for which no function has been ascribed. Moreover, when function is known, the host target to which the effector binds has not always been identified. Finally, when effector function and target are known, the molecular basis of effector-target interaction often remains to be determined. This proposal aims to address these issues using a structural biology approach. Another issue addressed by this proposal is the structural and molecular characterisation of the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system responsible for effector secretion through the double membrane of Legionella. Therefore, we propose here three complementary lines of research: i- using a structural biology approach, we will determine the structures of functionally-uncharacterised Legionella effectors in order to derive their function; any function derived from structure will be validated by Professor Craig Roy, a leading researcher in the field of Legionella infection. ii- when/once the effector&#226;&#128;&#153;s target is known, we will investigate the molecular basis of effector-target interaction by determining the structure of the binary effector-target complexes. iii- we will investigate the structure of the secretion apparatus that is responsible for secreting effectors through the Legionnella membrane. This proposal will greatly enhance our knowledge of the various mechanisms used by pathogenic bacteria to develop intra-cellularly in humans, and provide the basis for drug design efforts aiming at neutralizing Legionella infection.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,475,317</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SUMOBRAIN"><Rcn>90355</Rcn><Nid>11507</Nid><HI>University Of Bristol, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Mechanisms and consequences of synaptic SUMOylation in health and disease</Name><PI>Jeremy Martin Henley</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Synaptic protein SUMOylation is a completely new and exciting field of investigation. This application will investigate the roles of SUMOylation in normal and pathological synaptic transmission. The functional and pathophysiological implications for synaptic protein SUMOylation are far-reaching. SUMOylation has already been implicated in a diverse array of synaptopathies. Therefore, better understanding of the regulation and consequences of synaptic SUMOylation is of fundamental importance. The starting hypothesis is that targeted SUMOylation of pre- and postsynaptic proteins regulates synaptic transmission and can be neuroprotective through the reduction of excitotoxicity. The main proposal objectives are to: 1) Identify and functionally characterise novel synaptic SUMOylated substrates.  2) Define how SUMOylation regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release.  3) Determine the activity-dependence of SUMO and SUMO specific protease (SENP) trafficking to synapses. 4) Elucidate the role of SUMOylation in regulating protein   protein interactions at synapses.  5) Define the roles of synaptic protein SUMOylation in ischaemia. These ambitious objectives directly address important challenges at the frontier of our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms regulating synaptic function and will open up new avenues for future basic and translational research. Novel tools and techniques will be used to test my hypotheses by identifying which synaptic proteins are SUMOylated and investigating the underlying mechanisms and downstream effects of SUMOylation in both normal neurones and in in vitro neuropathological models.

Ubiquitylation typically targets individual proteins, and high selectivity is achieved by a plethora of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ligases. Much less is known regarding how modification by the ubiquitin-related protein SUMO influences the function of substrates and how specificity is provided. Surprisingly, although SUMOylation affects roughly 10% of all yeast proteins, only very few enzymes participate in the pathway. Moreover, although SUMOylation is essential for viability, mutants defective in SUMOylation of individual substrates usually lack deleterious phenotypes. We recently solved this puzzle as we found that SUMOylation frequently targets protein groups (&#226;&#128;&#156;protein group modification&#226;&#128;&#157;) rather than individual substrates; single modifications are often redundant or additive as SUMO functions as intermolecular &#226;&#128;&#156;glue&#226;&#128;&#157;, thereby stabilizing protein complexes. Hence, the traditional view that a single PTM on a given protein mediates a specific function does not seem to apply for many SUMO modifications.
Entirely divergent from previous approaches we will thus focus for the first time specifically on protein group SUMOylation and its special requirements for specificity, induction and termination. Initially found for proteins of homologous recombination and nucleotide excision DNA repair, we will expand the concept of protein group SUMOylation with a focus on pathways relevant for cellular regulation and which are of medical importance. We will define the substrate repertoire of SUMO ligases, characterize their substrate targeting properties, and design novel tools aimed to address the function of protein group SUMOylation. We expect that our work will finally put studies of this important modifier on a solid basis and will break new ground in areas of cellular regulation and cell biology in general."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,475,254</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SUMOSTRESS"><Rcn>105939</Rcn><Nid>9331</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Integrating the activities of SUMO in gene expression, inflammation and cancer</Name><PI>Anne Dejean</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Sumoylation of proteins has emerged as a central regulatory mechanism influencing a wide range of cellular processes and is notably a key pathway facilitating cellular response to stress. Gene expression appears to be particularly regulated by sumoylation as many known SUMO substrates are transcription factors and cofactors. Moreover, key chromatin proteins, including the core histones, figure among the SUMO targets. The emerging paradigm for the proposed work is that sumoylation controls multiple aspects of chromatin structure and that sumoylated proteins are principal and instructive components of a dynamic chromatin scaffold that can respond to external cues. According to this view, sumoylation is expected to impact both global and specific transcriptional programs thereby affecting constitutive and inducible gene expression.
The goal of this project is to define the role of sumoylation-mediated gene control in stress response and to analyze the impact of dysregulation of this pathway in inflammation and cancer with a primary focus on the intestinal tract. Our specific aims are to 1) Identify stress-regulated molecular players of the SUMO pathway, 2) Define the genome-wide organization of the SUMO chromatin landscape and its plasticity upon stress, 3) Probe the role of sumoylation in normal and pathological inflammatory response with an emphasis on acute and chronic colitis, 4) Explore the possible implication of the SUMO pathway in colon cancer.
This project is supported by a wealth of preliminary data based on genomic approaches and mouse models for partial or complete loss of sumoylation. We expect our study to bring innovative concepts on sumoylation&#226;&#128;&#153;s role in normal and disease states. Novel regulators of sumoylation will be identified, unsuspected transcriptional networks will be uncovered, determinants of human malignancies and inflammatory diseases will potentially be identified, with a view toward therapeutic strategies seeking to manipulate sumoylation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,996</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SURVIVE"><Rcn>109003</Rcn><Nid>10313</Nid><HI>Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Netherlands</HI><Name>Integrating cancer detection and SURgery Via molecular Imaging</Name><PI>Cornelis Jan Hadde Van De Velde</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The ambitious aim of this ERC-advanced grant proposal is to develop strategies that will connect cancer detection and surgery via tumor-specific molecular imaging techniques.

Fine-tuning the relation between tumor diagnosis, neoadjuvant treatment, preoperative planning and minimally invasive image-guided surgery will likely improve radical oncologic surgery while reducing surgical morbidity in cancer patients.

The mechanistic aim of the proposal is to develop an integrated multimodal imaging strategy that will more accurately connect tumor biology with surgical resection approaches via the use of tumor-specific molecular imaging agents.

Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in Rhizobium-legume interactions is a major contributor to the combined nitrogen pool in the biosphere. It takes place in root nodules where giant plant cells host the nitrogen fixing bacteria. In Medicago nodules both the plant cells and the bacteria are polyploids and incapable for cell division. These polyploid plant cells produce hundreds of symbiotic peptides (symPEPs) that provoke terminal differentiation of bacteria in symbiosis and exhibit broad range antimicrobial activities in vitro. Permanent generation of polyploid cells is essential for the nodule development. It will be studied whether the complete genome is duplicated in consecutive endocycles, how different ploidy levels affect DNA methylation and expression profile and whether polyploidy is required for the expression of symPEP genes.

The other half of cardiac mortality occurs suddenly, essentially due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
The main objectives of SYMPHONY are (i) to advance our fundamental understanding in the mechanisms underlying SCD and electrical dyssynchrony in HF, with a strong focus on the specialized ventricular conduction network, and (ii) to improve current preventive, diagnostic and treatment methods for these life-threatening cardiac electrical disorders.
SYMPHONY is a multidisciplinary project that will benefit from a wide array of state-of-the-art methodologies and expertise, both in fundamental and clinical sciences. A large mammalian species, the sheep, will be used for a detailed characterization of the properties of the conduction network in health and disease. Importantly, a limited number of explanted human hearts will be available on which all these techniques will equally be applicable. From our clinical work, SYMPHONY will benefit from cutting edge tools in epicardial and catheter mapping allowing simultaneous mapping of the Purkinje system and ventricular substrate.

Integrin based adhesion has been shown to participate in numerous processes in living cells, which sense, via their adhesions, multiple environmental cues, integrate them, and develop a complex, multi-parametric response. However, due to their intrinsic molecular complexity the specific functional roles of different components of the adhesion site are still poorly understood. To address this issue, we will utilize current knowledge of the modular nature of focal adhesions and related integrin-mediated extracellular matrix contacts to develop &#226;&#128;&#156;synthetic cell&#226;&#128;&#157; models, consisting of large lipid vesicles, functionalized by transmembrane integrins, various integrin-binding proteins and specific sets of scaffolding and signaling proteins of the adhesion sites. The one-by-one loading of these vesicles by micro-injection with these proteins will allow tight control of the system composition and complexity, and testing of the effect of compositional and environmental variations on the adhesion and signaling features. The &#226;&#128;&#156;synthetic cells&#226;&#128;&#157; will be plated on adhesive matrices displaying specific spatial, chemical and mechanical features for testing their chemical and mechanical sensing capabilities. The datasets produced in these experiments will provide a solid basis for reverse engineering perturbations of living cells, in which specific functional pathways will be targeted and/or modified to modulate living cells' functionality.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,499,799</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SYNGENE"><Rcn>104243</Rcn><Nid>11563</Nid><HI>Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Germany</HI><Name>Global Mapping of Synthetic Genetic Interactions in Drosophila</Name><PI>Michael Boutros</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The genetics underlying phenotype-genotype relationships during development and disease is often complex with many genes contributing to a particular phenotypic outcome. While forward genetic screens have uncovered many mutations that are limiting at a particular stage or tissue, the majority of genes in most genomes remain genetically untouched. Recent studies in model organisms, in particular in yeast, have provided evidence for the existence of pervasive genetic interactions with large effects on many phenotypes. Such genetic factors have been rather difficult to identify in classical loss-of-function screens due to buffering and other compensatory mechanisms, therefore requiring novel methodological approaches.

The systematic analysis of synthetic genetic interactions also revealed how biological systems achieve a high level of complexity with a limited repertoire of components. Large-scale studies yeast have taken advantage of deletion strains to construct matrices of quantitative interaction profiles and infer gene function. However, comparable approaches in higher organisms have been difficult to implement in a robust manner.

We here propose to create the first systematic synthetic genetic interaction map of a metazoan cell.  Based on methods that we recently pioneered, we will quantitatively measure genetic interactions between genes on a genome scale using Drosophila cells as a model. We will utilize the map to globally dissect the interaction between processes with a focus on signaling networks.  Furthermore, we will follow-up on selected interactions by in-depth characterization.  Synthetic genetic interactions will be further analyzed in vivo in tissues to complement the cell-based approaches. The project will advance new experimental and computational approaches applicable also to human cells and provide fundamental insights into the cellular circuitries that govern many processes in a metazoan cell.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SYNTHPHOTO"><Rcn>110618</Rcn><Nid>10196</Nid><HI>The University Of Sheffield, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Powering cells with light: the synthetic biology of photosynthesis</Name><PI>Christopher Hunter</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Billions of tonnes of chlorophylls are synthesised every year, then incorporated into the photosynthetic complexes that harvest and trap the solar energy that powers the biosphere. An understanding of the mechanisms that deliver chlorophylls to the growing photosynthetic apparatus is important for fundamental reasons, and also for future exploitation of photosynthesis as an energy source.

The SYNTHPHOTO project comprises two interlinked sections: the first (SP1) will provide a step change in our knowledge of photosystem assembly by showing how newly-synthesised pigments emerging from the (bacterio)chlorophyll synthases encounter the membrane-embedded assembly machinery and form the growing photosynthetic unit. Innovations in atomic force microscopy will provide the first nanoscale mapping information on the membrane location of the assembly machinery, and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry will quantify every component in the assembly pathway.

SP2 will harness this knowledge for the design and construction of new biological and bioinspired light-gathering and energy-trapping systems. The synthetic biology approach of SP2 will splice genes for pigment and assembly pathways from a variety of bacteria, reconfiguring the photosynthetic apparatus for enhanced spectral coverage. SP2 will explore the potential for &#226;&#128;&#152;bottom-up&#226;&#128;&#153; redesign and in vivo production of tailored arrays of photosynthetic complexes and enzymes. Building hybrid photosystems in SP2 augments the aims of SP1 by testing the adaptability of the native biosynthetic machinery, providing a new level of understanding of pigment biosynthesis and photosystem assembly pathways.

The overall aim of SYNTHPHOTO is to discover the mechanisms of assembly of the bacterial photosynthetic apparatus, and to harness this understanding for the design, development and implementation of new biological and bioinspired light-gathering and energy trapping systems.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,484,955</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SYNVGLUT"><Rcn>94187</Rcn><Nid>11303</Nid><HI>Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Vesicular glutamate transporters as molecular regulators of neural communication</Name><PI>Christian Rosenmund</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This proposal describes experiments aimed at defining the multiple roles of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) in central synapses. Classically, VGLUTs transport glutamate from the cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles. Deletion of these genes disrupts synaptic glutamate release and their expression suffices to determine neurons as glutamatergic. We recently discovered that VGLUTs control additional key parameters such as quantal size and vesicular release probability, suggesting that they are fundamental regulators of synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity. To study these novel functions, we will first address whether the number of VGLUTs per vesicle (VGLUT content) can affect the amount of stored glutamate and in addition, the probability of vesicle release. We will subsequently explore the underlying mechanisms. Second, we will test the hypothesis that different VGLUT paralogs contribute to functional differences in discrete synapse populations, as implied by our preliminary data and the distribution pattern of the two main paralogs VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the brain. Subsequently, we will perform structure function studies on VGLUTs in native synapses to identify the underlying molecular interactions. Finally, the little understood VGLUT3 paralog is expressed mainly in subclasses of cholinergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons, but no evidence exists that demonstrates VGLUT3 s role in glutamate release. We will address whether VGLUT3 is used to co-release glutamate with other neurotransmitters, and will test whether presence of glutamate in synaptic vesicles interferes with the storage or release of other neurotransmitters. Our studies will yield important insights into how these transporters operate, and how modulation of VGLUTs affects synaptic encoding and brain function. Because of observed profound regulation of VGLUTs in schizophrenia, depression and Parkinsons disease, these findings will also contribute to diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,413,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SYSCHEMBIOL"><Rcn>98011</Rcn><Nid>12876</Nid><HI>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Germany</HI><Name>Systems Chemical Biology- Chemical Biological Perturbation and Dissection of Dynamic Biological Systems</Name><PI>Herbert Waldmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>In Systems Chemical Biology research small drug-like molecules are employed to analyze the construction, wiring and spatiotemporal regulation of protein networks in dynamic biological systems.

Such network reconstructions form the foundation for systems analysis of metabolic functions in health and disease.  Over the past ten years, a series of genome-scale reconstructions have been built for microorganisms.  They have been demonstrated to be useful for developing a deeper understanding of physiological processes, drive discovery through computer generated hypothesis relating to missing parts of a network, to interpret the consequences of gene knock outs, and for metabolic engineering and bioprocess purposes.  With build-35 of the human genome sequence it has proved to be possible to initiate the build of a similar genome-scale reconstruction of metabolism in man.  Thus an era of systems biology analysis of human metabolic functions has just been opened, in an analogous fashion as happened for microorganisms about 10 years ago.  This proposal describes a program that will lead this new era.  Our three overall objectives are: 1) to continue to build the metabolic reconstruction in an iterative fashion as has been done for microorganisms in the past, 2) to deploy existing computer algorithms to systematically fill in gaps in our knowledge base about human metabolism, and 3) to use the reconstruction high-throughput data analysis and to begin the effort of drug screening and discovery for metabolic interventions.  The PI has been active in this field for over 25 years, and, in fact, has been a leader in developing reconstruction technology, the computer methods that are used to characterize them, and bring them to practical uses.  He has been particularly active in training young scientist in this field and been involved in translational research and company startups.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,399,634</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SecMessBiofilm"><Rcn>94576</Rcn><Nid>12070</Nid><HI>Humboldt-Universitaet Zu Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Cyclic-di-GMP: New Concepts in Second Messenger Signaling and Bacterial Biofilm Formation</Name><PI>Regine Hengge</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Biofilms represent a multicellular lifestyle of bacteria that causes serious biomedical and technological problems. Biofilm developmental involves an inhibition of motility and an induction of adhesins at the cell surface and culminates in complex structures, in which bacteria are embedded in an extracellular matrix, which renders them resistant against antibiotics and host immune systems. The overall objective of the proposed project is to clarify nature and nurture in bacterial biofilm formation, i.e. to reveal the underlying genetic control network and its integration with environmentally responsive pathways that influence biofilm composition and architecture. The major working hypothesis of this proposal is that the ubiquitously biofilm-stimulating second messenger c-di-GMP and the many proteins associated with its synthesis, degradation and action are mainly responsible for this integration (i) by providing the molecular switches that establish the metastable states characteristic for biofilm development, and (ii) by integrating many of the environmental signals that modulate biofilm composition and architecture. Even in single species, c-di-GMP is produced and degraded by multiple diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF domain proteins) and phosphodiesterases (EAL domain proteins), respectively. This project will elucidate the regulation, function, cooperation and targets of all 29 GGDEF/EAL domain proteins during the entire series of molecular events that generates a biofilm of the model organism Escherichia coli, which includes commensals as well as important pathogens. As c-di-GMP is used by virtually all bacteria, understanding its production and mode of action will open new and general perspectives for interference with bacterial biofilm formation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,998,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SelSweep"><Rcn>94112</Rcn><Nid>9379</Nid><HI>Wageningen University, Netherlands</HI><Name>Molecular characterization of genetic factors in the pig under selection during speciation, domestication and breeding</Name><PI>Martinus Antonius Mathilda Groenen</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>I will analyze the changes in the genome of the pig during speciation, domestication and selection at the molecular level. Domestication and selection have resulted in a large number of distinct breeds worldwide with very distinct characteristics. Unique are also the availability of 12 closely related pig species that have diverged over a time span of 1 to 10 million years. Furthermore, the availability of a high quality genome sequence of the pig by the end of 2009 and the recent advances in next generation sequencing technology makes the SelSweep proposal extremely timely. Within the SelSweep project I will explore the genes and genomic regions that are and have been under strong selection during speciation, early domestication and during subsequent development of specific breeds in the pig. The results of the project will substantially advance our knowledge of evolutionary biology at the molecular level. Moreover, knowledge about the genes affected by selection opens up new directions for further improvement of this important livestock species. The direct sequencing of individuals from a variety of populations using next generation sequencing enables an unbiased capture of the full breadth of genetic variation in the porcine genome addressing both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as copy number variants (CNVs). The analysis will be done using a previously established porcine HapMap population consisting of domestic breeds from China, Europe and the US, wild boar populations from across the world as well as museum samples representing ancient pig populations.

This has profound implications because senses determine how animals find and discriminate between mates or prey, avoid potential predators, and locate better microhabitats.  For example, changed visual environments will cause predictable evolutionary changes in visual contrast to predator and prey, in turn causing evolutionary changes in visually based mate and prey choice, evolution in microhabitat selection (which affects the light environment and hence visual contrast) and evolution in the visual system.  I propose to test a series of predictions about evolution of  these four suites of traits by (1) experimental evolution experiments over 15 generations in laboratory guppy populations under three different light environments to test predictions about changes in male colour patterns, female preferences for male patterns, and changes in the guppy colour vision system and (2) 15 generation guppy evolution experiments to test for co-option of prey-search cues as mate choice cues and evolution of the other trait suites  The EU has 80% of the world's Sensory Ecologists and I will consolidate and make the EU lead obvious by encouraging collaborations between disparate groups and encouraging young scientists.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,592,504</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Silent HIV"><Rcn>94442</Rcn><Nid>11667</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Paving the way toward HIV eradication/control</Name><PI>Monsef Benkirane</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Human Immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, infects primarily cells of the immune system. The outcome of HIV-1 infection results from complex interactions between viral proteins and host cell factors (ref). In most cases, HIV-1 successfully hijacks cellular pathways and bypasses cellular restriction factors for optimal replication leading to continuous rounds of infection, replication and cell death (ref). Continuous viral replication causes the loss of CD4+T cells and progression to immunodeficiency in infected individuals. However, in certain situations virus replication can be successfully controlled. First, HAART (Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy) treatment revealed the existence of a pool of resting memory CD4+ T cells harbouring integrated but silent HIV-1 provirus. Although this situation occurs in a small number of cells, it suggests that intracellular defence mechanisms can be effective against HIV. This long lived viral reservoir is believed to be the major obstacle against HIV-1 eradication by HAART. Second, HIV-infected individuals who are able to control their virus to undetectable levels for many years in absence of any treatment have been identified and referred to as Elite HIV controllers EC . Again, this is a rare situation observed in 0.5% of infected patients. Still, it demonstrates that it is possible to naturally and effectively control HIV replication and disease progression. A common feature of these two situations is that virus replication is controlled at the gene expression level. A major challenge in the HIV field is to understand how these naturally occurring situations where intracellular defence and/or immune response win the battle against HIV. Our project aim at identifying the host factors and define the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of virus replication both in HAART-treated and in EC patients.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,019,500</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Sip-Vol+"><Rcn>106468</Rcn><Nid>9508</Nid><HI>Eesti Maaulikool, Estonia</HI><Name>Stress-Induced Plant Volatiles in Biosphere-Atmosphere System</Name><PI>&#195;&#188;lo Niinemets</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Vegetation forms a key interface between Earth surface and atmosphere. The important role of vegetation carbon, water and energy exchanges is well established, but the overall impact of plant trace gas (VOC) emission for large-scale Earth processes is poorly understood. Although it is widely accepted that VOCs play major roles in the formation of ozone, secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and cloud condensation nuclei (CNN) with potentially profound impacts on air quality and Earth radiative balance, the research has so far focused only on constitutive emissions from species considered &#226;&#128;&#156;emitters&#226;&#128;&#157;. However, differently from constitutive VOCs emitted only by certain species, all plant species can be triggered to emit induced VOCs under abiotic and biotic stress. So far, induced high-reactivity VOCs are not considered in global VOC budget, and thus, this proposal tests the key assumption that VOC emissions worldwide have been vastly underestimated. As global change is resulting in higher level of stress in Earth ecosystems, the relevance of induced emissions is further expected to gain in importance. The current project has the overall objective to evaluate the effect of plant-generated VOC emissions on air composition and environment under global change, with particular emphasis on the role of VOCs induced in response to environmental stress. The study first quantifies the VOC production vs. stress severity relationships across species with differing stress tolerance and advances and parameterizes the qualitative induced VOC model developed by PI. The novel quantitative model is further verified by flux measurements and scaled up to regional and global scales to assess the contribution of induced emissions to overall VOC budget, and study the feedbacks between stress, ozone, SOA and CNN formation and the Earth climate using an hierarchy of available models. This highly cross-disciplinary project is expected to result in key contributions in two research fields of major significance: plant stress tolerance from molecules to globe and the role of vegetation component in atmospheric reactivity and Earth climate. The first part of the study provides fundamental insight into the stress responsiveness of plants with differing tolerance to environmental limitations, extending &#226;&#128;&#156;leaf economics spectrum&#226;&#128;&#157;, a hotspot of current plant ecology research.

Recently the role of the sirtuin cofactor gene family received a lot of attention in this context, as their beneficial impact on longevity was linked to effects on metabolic control. Most sirtuins catalyze deacetylation reactions that are tightly linked to cellular energy (NAD+) levels. To ascertain the tissue-specific contributions of sirtuins in metabolism, we propose here to: 1) identify novel deacetylation targets for the sirtuins; 2) generate and characterize genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) with somatic mutations in the 7 sirtuin genes in liver, muscle and adipose tissue, key metabolic tissues; 3) study mouse models with natural genetic variation in sirtuin expression, such as found in genetic reference populations (GRPs), like the BxD recombinant inbred mouse lines; and 4) validate the relevance of sirtuin signaling for human metabolism through clinical genetic studies. As the goal is to progress towards the treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases in humans, GEMMs are optimized to study the actions of isolated genetic loci and are thus insufficient to characterize polygenic networks and genetic interactions. Moreover environmental factors can impact on the manifestations of the genotype or phenocopy the genetically produced phenotype. Thus, to dissect complex genetic traits, experimental models, like GRPs, that imitate the genetic structure of human populations provide complimentary information to that obtained from GEMMs. As we will combine data generated using directional genetic strategies in GEMMs with a high-throughput phenogenomic analysis of GRPs, our approach merges the benefits of clear-cut results of single gene perturbations in a given tissue with subtle alterations that result from natural innumerable allelic variants. This will ultimately favor the definition of the role of the sirtuins in metabolic homeostasis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,485,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Social life"><Rcn>94363</Rcn><Nid>12072</Nid><HI>Universite De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>The evolution of social life and division of labour</Name><PI>Laurent Keller</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The hallmark of social insect colonies is reproductive division of labour which is often associated with dramatic morphological and behavioural differences between queens, workers and males. The aim of this proposal is three-fold. First, we will use our recently developed fiducial identification system to investigate the general principles of social organisation and division of labour. The video tracking of workers labelled with markers derived from the augmented reality library ARTag allows us for the first time to distinguish up to 2000 individuals and precisely locate them every 500ms, hence allowing large-scale experiments addressing the question of how the behaviour of individual workers is influenced by the joint effects of environmental factors and social interactions. The second related aim is to investigate how the level of altruism within colonies and the reliability of communication systems are shaped by colony kin structure. Because it is not possible to conduct artificial evolution with social insects we will use a new experimental system consisting of colonies of small mobile robots with simple vision and communication abilities. This system permits to conduct hundreds of generations of experimental evolution in colonies with variable group composition to identify the factors affecting the evolution of altruism and communication. Finally, we will complement these studies with a genetic perspective using a remarkable genetic social polymorphism that we recently discovered in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. The advent of new ultra high-throughput sequencing techniques will allow us to document the steps involved in the evolution of this genetic social polymorphism and test the suggestion that the chromosome involved in the social polymorphism has the properties of a sex chromosome.

For local disease, exogenous energy will be used to to release drugs entrapped within nanoparticles circulating through the tumor. This will be achieved via a combination of Focused Ultrasound, and drug nanocarriers that are sensitive to bio-effects of ultrasound.
The drug &#194;&#191;magic bullet&#194;&#191; is at the heart of Pharma&#194;&#191;s business model. However, targeted drug delivery is increasingly being recognized as a key limiting factor of drug efficacy. Nanotechnologies are providing new formulations as well as novel methods for targeting. The combination of nanotechnologies and external triggering will provide novel technologies to achieve spatio-temporal control of drug delivery. The effect of ultrasound in tissue allows the local deposition of drugs from nanocarriers circulating in the blood, and/or their local activation. This is the case when using nanocarriers sensitive to mechanical forces and/or to small temperature elevations. Extravasation and membrane permeability are also enhanced by ultrasound. This new field of Image Guided Drug Delivery opens up opportunities for Pharma to expand applications for their existing small drugs (e.g. doxorubicin, cisplatin, irinitecan) in cancer by altered pharmacokinetics.  This project intends to develop new focused ultrasound methods for drug delivery, based on local control of temperature and pressure, and by monitoring and validating intracellular uptake in real time using optical and MRI methods. The developed FUS methods will be applied to treatment of liver cancer using nanocarriers containing well known chemotherapeutica, via animal models, as well as in the clinic.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-12-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-11-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SpaceRadarPollinator"><Rcn>185402</Rcn><Nid>11961</Nid><HI>Queen Mary And Westfield College, University Of London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Space use by bees&#226;&#128;&#147; radar tracking of spatial movement patterns of key pollinators</Name><PI>Lars Chittka</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Current radar tracking technology to monitor insect movements in space allows us to catch only glimpses of their spatial movements &#226;&#128;&#147; it is severely constrained by the restricted range that can be covered, the fact that individuals can only be tracked one at a time, and the lack of a height dimension. Here we propose ground-breaking technology advances to make insect telemetry fit for the 21st century, to answer multiple fundamental questions in pollinator space use and its implications for the plants they pollinate. We will work towards transponder miniaturisation to make application to a large number of insect species viable; we will develop radar technology to allow coverage of areas of up to 10km2 and the exploration of the 3rd dimension of insect flight, and we will adapt the equipment so that multiple individuals can be traced simultaneously. We will identify the rules of bee movements at the landscape scale, and the extent to which they use familiar landmarks and learnt vectors to link multiple locations. We will explore whether speed-accuracy tradeoffs are relevant in landmark navigation. Natural resource exploration and exploitation will be monitored over the entire foraging career of select individuals, and we will quantify individual differences in space use. Tracking bees in three dimensions will allow us to ask whether looking at the landscape from above aids efficient navigation. The tracking of multiple bees simultaneously will allow us to monitor competitive interactions as well as the possibility of social learning in space use. For the first time we will also track the spatial movement strategies of queens and males to see how they interface the search for mates with the need to forage efficiently. Our findings will have wide-ranging applications not just for the understanding of pollinator space use, but also for the conservation, management, and the understanding of mating patterns in the plants they pollinate.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>3,438,922</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SpeciationGenetics"><Rcn>188496</Rcn><Nid>12192</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The genomic architecture of speciation in tropical butterflies</Name><PI>Christopher Jiggins</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>These are exciting times for speciation research with a wealth of recent theoretical and empirical advances, but there is much we still do not understand. The Heliconius butterflies offer an excellent opportunity to gain novel insights into the genetic architecture of speciation and its genomic consequences, by integrating genomic data with the well-studied ecological and behavioural processes that underlie speciation in this group. Here I will bring together two lines of recent research in speciation, a) the evolution of genetic architectures, such as clustering of barrier genes, that facilitate divergence in the face of gene flow and b) the genomic patterns of divergence. First, I will apply large-scale whole genome resequencing to study divergence and gene flow between species, and test whether speciation proceeds through divergence of gradually expanding genomic islands under divergent selection. I will also develop novel theory to interpret these patterns. Second, I will test whether loci controlling behavioural and ecological traits that cause reproductive isolation are clustered in the genome, using a genome-wide quantitative trait analysis of reproductive isolation in two hybridizing species pairs. Third, I will investigate the role of chromosomal rearrangements in reducing between-species recombination rate where species hybridize, and directly study their influence on recombination rate. Overall, the project will integrate information on the distribution of genes controlling ecological, behavioural and genetic differences between species with patterns of recombination, in order to understand the process of genome divergence and adaptive radiation. This work will offer new insights into speciation, a process fundamental to evolution and biodiversity, but also has wider implications for our understanding of the processes that drive genome evolution.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,988</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="StAdvInn"><Rcn>108238</Rcn><Nid>10938</Nid><HI>University Of Rijeka Medical Faculty, Croatia</HI><Name>Strengthening adaptive immunity via innate immunity: enhancing the CD8 T cell response by using the NKG2D ligand expressed in a herpesvirus vector</Name><PI>Stipan Jonjic</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>CD8+ T cells play a key role in the control of infections by intracellular pathogens. Recently, several top-notch studies provided ample evidence that NK cells are important in the regulation of CD8+ T cell response. NKG2D is an activating NK cell receptor which plays a role in the adaptive immune response by co-stimulating CD8+ T cells. Due to unique pattern of immune response, live attenuated CMVs are attractive candidates as vaccine vectors for a number of clinically relevant infections. The main idea behind this project stems from our preliminary data which suggest that a recombinant CMV vector expressing NKG2D ligand has a tremendous potential for subverting viral immunoevasion and boosting the efficiency of CD8 T cell response.
During the project we plan to systematically investigate the impact of all major innate immunity players on the CD8+ T cell response. A special focus will be given in obtaining new knowledge on the maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells during latent infection. This study will also provide novel insights on the role of NKG2D in both NK and T cell immunity. In order to test our hypothesis in vivo, we will employ state-of-the-art technology used in herpesvirus genetics coupled with high-end immune monitoring. Ultimately, we will translate our results to a human CMV vector, in order to gauge the impact of NKG2D signaling on immune response in a humanized mouse model.
We believe that the significance of the proposed study is enormous since stimulating CD8+ T cells has been widely recognized as a method of choice for vaccine development. There are relatively large number of pathogens for which the immunity acquired post-infection does not fully shelter against re-infection and disease. Therefore, we are in a desperate need for vaccines which offer superior protection compared to the one following natural infection. This study will provide groundbreaking information which will set the stage for the development of new vaccines and vaccine vectors.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,754,897</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Stem cells for DMD"><Rcn>90078</Rcn><Nid>13030</Nid><HI>The University Of Manchester, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Novel strategies for the cell therapy of muscular dystrophies</Name><PI>Giulio Cossu</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims to develop an effective cell therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). To reach this goal we plan to transfer a human artificial  chromosome containing the whole dystrophin locus into dystrophic mesoangioblasts. As the transfer is inefficient and requires selection, it is impossible to use primary cells that would undergo senescence during selection. Therefore we need to reversibly immortalize DMD patient mesoangioblasts by the combined use of lentiviral vectors expressing either floxed human telomerase (h-Tert) or floxed Bmi1 (and also the Herpes Simplex Thymidine Kinase, HSTK). Immortal clones, selected for proper expression of h-Tert and Bmi1 and maintenance of a mesoangioblast phenotype, will be transfected with a human artificial chromosome expressing human dystrophin. Expressing clones will be selected and characterized. Before transplantation, selected clones will be infected with an adenoviral vector expressing the Cre recombinase and then treated with Gancyclovir. Transduced and selected cells will be transplanted into mdx/SCID (dystrophic and immune deficient) mice and the extent of dystrophin reconstitution and consequent functional benefit will be evaluated. In addition, the possible immune reaction to the transgenes or novel antigens generated by the experimental strategy will be monitored by an in vitro assay utilizing donor s dendritic cells and T lymphocytes.  Finally this strategy will be repeated in Golden Retriever dystrophic dogs, the closest animal model to DMD. Dog mesoangioblasts will be reversibly immortalized, transduced with the dystrophin HAC and, after viral excision and GC selection, transplanted in the same dogs from which they had been directly isolated.  Dystrophin expression, functional amelioration and possible toxic and immune reactions will be monitored. This project will  therefore cover all pre-clinical experimentation and would set the stage for immediate clinical translation.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,900,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="StemCellGerontoGenes"><Rcn>109029</Rcn><Nid>10309</Nid><HI>Leibniz-Institut Fur Alternsforschung - Fritz-Lipmann-Institut Ev (Fli) Leibniz Institute On Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute Ev (Fli), Germany</HI><Name>Longevity and aging associated genes that control self-renewal and function of adult stem cells during aging</Name><PI>Karl Lenhard Rudolph</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Adult stem cells are essential for the lifelong maintenance and regeneration of various organs and tissues. Experimental and clinical data indicate that the functional capacity of adult stem cells in organ regeneration declines during aging. Molecular mechanisms that cause impairments in stem cell function during aging remain to be delineated. Genetic analyses identified a growing number of genes and genetic loci that are associated with longevity and aging in model organisms and humans. For most of these associations the molecular mechanisms and its functional relevance for mammalian aging remain unknown. In many cases of genetic loci associations, the responsible genes have not even been identified. A bottleneck in our understanding of aging remains to identify functionally relevant genes and molecular mechanisms from this growing list of genetic association with aging. Emerging experimental data indicate that aging/longevity-associated genes influence the functional reserve of adult stem cells. Here, I propose to develop and lead a research program analyzing longevity and aging associated genes and gene loci by reverse genetic approaches. In vivo and ex vivo RNAi will identify genes and molecular mechanisms that affect the function of stem cells in aging mice or genetically engineered mice modeling accelerated accumulation of molecular damages and stem cell dysfunction. Analysis of primary human stem cells from young vs. old donors will delineate whether the identified genes and mechanisms are conserved in humans. Reverse genetic approaches of aging/longevity-associated genes have not been conducted in adult mammalian stem cells. Our group gained significant expertise in analyzing molecular mechanisms of stem cell maintenance and function as well as in conducting RNAi screens in different murine stem cell compartments. Our studies will delineate novel mechanisms of stem cell aging and its implication for defects in organ homeostasis and regeneration during aging.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,498,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="StemDNAFate"><Rcn>107502</Rcn><Nid>9575</Nid><HI>Institut Pasteur, France</HI><Name>Genetic and Epigenetic Regulation of Stem Cell Fate</Name><PI>Shahragim Tajbakhsh</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Stem cells play crucial roles in establishing and repairing tissues, yet our knowledge of their properties, how they assure organogenesis and effect regeneration in distinct physiological contexts remains limited. A major challenge in stem cell biology is investigating these cells in their natural state in vivo, and obtaining highly pure and sufficient quantities for characterisation.

Skeletal myogenesis provides an excellent paradigm to investigate stem cell function and regenerative biology because of its accessibility, and its striking ability to regenerate efficiently. Futhermore, the same individual can undergo multiple rounds of muscle injury thereby permitting the long term study of stem cell turnover and homeostasis after inflicted trauma without life threatening consequences or complex surgical procedures.

The objective of this research programme is to identify mouse stem cell properties and understand how they regulate cell fate choice in different contexts by modulating their modes of cell divisions. Specifically, biased DNA segregation, which has been reported in diverse organisms from bacteria to vertebrates and is thus an evolutionary ancient phenomenon, will be investigated. Notably, we developed genetic tools that allow us to isolate prospectively those cells that execute asymmetric vs. symmetric cell divisions during regeneration, and directly linked cell fates with biased DNA segregation. The use of innovative nucleotides, micropatterns to mimic the niche, epigenetic, genetic and single cell transcriptomics strategies comprise a multi-pronged strategy to uncover the underlying mechanisms that govern asymmetric cell fates and biased DNA segregation. This knowledge will be projected to tissuegenesis using complementary clonal lineage tracing and live imaging of cell divisions in vivo. These studies aim to identify the diverse modes of stem cell divisions during tissuegenesis, information that can significantly impact on regenerative medicine.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,494,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SyStematics"><Rcn>109101</Rcn><Nid>9307</Nid><HI>Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, France</HI><Name>Dynamics and Homeostasis of Germinal Zones in the Adult Vertebrate Brain</Name><PI>Laure Bally-Cuif</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing and multipotent progenitors generating neurons and glia in the adult vertebrate brain. The success of NSC maintenance and mobilization varies widely among species, brain territories, pathological conditions and individual environment, with important physiological impacts. On these grounds, our proposal aims to define the cellular, molecular and systems components controlling the formation of NSC-containing GZs and sustaining the dynamics of GZ reservoirs during an animal&#226;&#128;&#153;s life, in the context of environmental challenge. We will rely on a novel and powerful model system, the dorsal telencephalon of the adult zebrafish, which harbors a large and superficially located GZ, enriched in NSCs and capable of efficient NSC recruitment. Our previous work highlighted the general relevance of this model, which harbors, like in mammals, quiescent NSCs of glial identity, and can be subject along life to pathological attrition, silencing, or amplification. This system was also instrumental in our identification of Notch signaling as a key control factor of NSC quiescence, a major parameter of GZ equilibrium. To dissect the mechanistic fundaments underlying homeostasis of this GZ, we propose here a combination of cutting edge approaches including the genetic modification and profiling of single NSCs in situ, the mathematical modeling of NSC clonal behavior in physiological and pathological states, and the development of novel optical tools to image for the first time the behavior of NSC populations and in intact, live adult vertebrate. This multidisciplinary and multi-scale approach will reveal the single-cell and population rules governing GZ dynamics, robustness and drifts in healthy and diseased conditions, and will feed these mechanisms with molecular support. More generally, it will generate a quantitative framework to probe the molecular and cellular effects of pathological and environmental challenges on NSC behavior.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,855</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-09-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-08-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SysArc"><Rcn>89109</Rcn><Nid>12839</Nid><HI>Wageningen University, Netherlands</HI><Name>Systems Biology to understand Plant Architecture</Name><PI>Ben J.G.

This lack of strictly hierarchical control mechanisms poses a challenge to developmental biologists: the outcome of interaction networks with extensive feedbacks is not intuitive and must be analyzed with analytical tools. Here, I propose a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches to study control mechanisms of plant architecture and their emergent properties. The plant hormone auxin appears to be a major player in developmental patterning and architecture. We and others have shown previously that auxin distribution patterns can self-organize and elaborate different architectures by principles of self-organization. We have discovered that the PLETHORA transcription factors, which form instructive gradients during root development, are involved in early embryo and shoot development as well, and that they constitute a  principal component  of plant development. Excitingly, PLETHORA genes are regulated by auxin accumulation but they feed back on the most important actors that determine auxin distribution, the PIN proteins. The dynamics of this PLETHORA-PIN loop can display emergent properties that may explain the majority of principal patterning events that determine root and shoot specification as well as branching. Here, I propose to investigate this feedback system in detail using (1) molecular genetic approaches, (2) computer modelling and (3) functional genomics approaches. The projected outcomes are a deep understanding of major control mechanisms for tissue pattern and organismal architecture and general insights into genetic information encoding using tangled hierarchies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,240,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SysStemCell"><Rcn>185407</Rcn><Nid>12364</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Regulatory transcriptional networks orchestrating mouse pluripotent embryonic stem cells</Name><PI>Hendrik Gerard Stunnenberg</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The lack of a quantitative framework around the dynamics of gene expression and its determinants represents a major hurdle for capturing transcription regulation into regulatory models. Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) provide an excellent cellular model to quantitatively define the principles of gene regulation at the biochemical and (epi)genetic level. In SysStemCell, I will focus on two distinct mouse pluripotent cell states. My recent studies have shown that the epigenome and transcriptome of ESCs maintained in serum-free medium complemented with two kinase inhibitors and LIF (&#226;&#128;&#152;2i ESC&#226;&#128;&#153;) are distinct from classical ESCs cultured in the presence of serum and LIF (&#226;&#128;&#152;serum ESC&#226;&#128;&#153;).  Importantly, the 2i ESCs reflect pre-implantation stage ICM cells whereas the widely studied serum cells reflect post-implantation ESCs. These two distinct pluripotent states are interconvertible in vitro, providing an unique and accessible model to explore the regulation of the pre- to post-implantation phase of early embryonic development. I will combine state-of-the-art proteomics and chromatin-based methods, including a novel in vivo UV femtosecond laser crosslinking approach, and in depths bioinformatics in an iterative manner to define the full compendium of transcription (co)factors (TF) and TF-modules that define the two cell states. The dynamics of long- and short-range interactions between these modules will be assessed and correlated with the epigenetic state and chromatin structure. Novel and existing factors will be assessed for their role in differentiation from 2i to serum and reverse programming using knockout and forced expression strategies. Collectively, my studies will provide an invaluable resource for the community and a deep insight in the mechanisms and general principles that orchestrate gene expression in particular in the hitherto unexplored transition at implantation during early mouse development.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="SystemsHox.ch"><Rcn>89774</Rcn><Nid>12974</Nid><HI>Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>A System Approach to Hox Genes Regulation in Vertebrates</Name><PI>Denis Duboule</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The aim of this grant is to understand the relationships between genomic topology and the control of transcription, using the HoxD locus as a paradigm. We will take a system approach in the mouse, combining tools of genetics, evolutionary genomics and biochemistry to try and model various modes of large-scale gene regulations occurring during development. The results will tell us about the mechanistic bases of global gene regulation and how such regulations evolved, by integrating these mechanisms into the evolutionnary contexts of the respective structures. The approach will make use of our unique collection of mutants at this locus along with both transcript profiling and quantitation, ChIP of several proteins (modifications thereof-) indicative of chromatin states, chromosome conformation capture (4C) and transgenesis after phylogenetic footprint. To keep datasets within reasonable scales and allow for their integration into a single model structures, we will focus on a 2 Mb large DNA interval centered around the HoxD locus, which contains range of conserved non-coding DNA sequences and includes a gene-rich island, flanked by two large gene-deserts bordered again by gene-rich regions. We will conduct systematic analyses of these multiple parameters in various embryonic tissues, at different times where and when Hox genes are required. The massive datasets generated (ca 15 different points for transcript quantification, profiling, chromatin modifications, 4C, from ca 10 different tissues at 3 developmental times, from as many as 20 mutant strains) will feed mechanistic models accounting for the modalities of these regulations. Models will be compared to one another to try and reconstitute the evolution of these regulations.

Yet, in conjunction with the first successful results in the clinic, severe adverse events linked to the gene transfer protocol were reported. Recently, we provided proof-of-principle of two new powerful strategies to improve the efficacy and safety of gene transfer: 1) regulating transgene expression by exploiting cellular microRNAs; 2) targeting integration at predetermined sites of the genome by forcing homologous recombination with designer Zinc finger nucleases. Here we will investigate the microRNA network regulating hematopoiesis and exploit the new knowledge to develop vectors with stringently controlled expression throughout the hematopoietic lineages. We will develop Zinc finger nuclease-based vectors that insert the transgene with high efficiency and specificity either downstream to its own endogenous promoter or into a safe genomic harbor that allows for robust expression without interference on the neighboring genes. By combining these strategies we will provide radically improved gene transfer platforms. Furthermore, we will exploit these technologies for the generation and genetic correction of induced pluripotent stem cells, providing a potentially unlimited source of patient-derived vector free gene corrected multipotent stem cells for future applications of regenerative medicine. The new gene therapy strategies will be tested in pre-clinical models of leukodystrophies and immunodeficiencies, for which we have extensive experience, and should enter a clinical trial for at least one such disease by the end of the proposed funding period.

Using larger cohorts of TB patients and controls than previous studies, together with complementary analytical approaches of modular, pathway and gene level analysis, we identified a striking interferon (IFN)-inducible neutrophil-driven signature of active TB. This IFN-inducible gene signature correlated with extent of radiographic disease and was represented by Type I IFN as well as IFN-gamma-inducible genes. We propose to apply the knowledge obtained from our study of human TB to study in depth the potential role of Type I IFNs and Type I IFN-inducible genes in TB pathogenesis in susceptible genetic strains of mice infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) strains. We propose to develop a modular tool to study complex transcriptional data in blood from mouse models of disease, as has been done for human disease, to allow accurate comparison of mouse models with human TB, and allow rapid analysis of the immune response at the transcriptional level to reflect pathogenesis, but also in the study of MTb-infected mice where potential pathways of pathogenesis have been perturbed. Based on our findings in human TB we propose to test the hypothesis that Type I IFN and genes induced by this pathway during TB, including Tripartite motif-containing proteins (TRIMs), are important determinants of pathogenesis. This will be achieved by their elimination or perturbation in susceptible TB models and in MTb-infected macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils to define molecular mechanisms contributing to their role in TB pathogenesis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,522,491</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TEL STEM CELL"><Rcn>90366</Rcn><Nid>11215</Nid><HI>Fundacion Centro Nacional De Investigaciones Oncologicas Carlos Iii, Spain</HI><Name>FROM TELOMERE CHROMATIN TO STEM CELL BIOLOGY</Name><PI>Maria A.

Telomeres consist of tandem TTAGGG repeats bound to a 6-protein complex known as shelterin. More recently, telomeres have been also shown to contain long non-coding telomeric RNAs (TelRNAs or TERRAs), which are associated to the telomeric chromatin and have been proposed to be potential regulators of telomerase activity and telomere length. In addition, telomeric chromatin is enriched in epigenetic marks characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin, such as histone trimethylation (H3K9 and H4K20 tri-methylation) and DNA hypermethylation, which act as negative regulators of telomere length. Telomere length defects are associated to both cancer and aging processes, and have been recently shown to have a profound effect on stem cell behaviour. Here, we propose to determine the role of both genetic and epigenetic telomere regulators in cancer and aging by generating new mouse models.

Among the fundamental roles of telomeres is their role in meiosis, the process by which parental genomes are recombined and halved, allowing the generation of genetic diversity via sexual reproduction. As cells progress from mitotic to meiotic cycles, telomere functions change radically as all telomeres gather to a small region of the nuclear periphery near the centrosome to form the telomere bouquet . While this bouquet is widely conserved, the challenges of manipulating meiosis in most eukaryotes has made bouquet function a matter of speculation until recently. We utilize the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to study telomeres, as this organism provides a powerful combination of genetic manipulability and striking conservation of chromosomal structure/function with human. Recently, we made the unexpected discovery that the bouquet controls the behavior of meiotic centrosomes and spindles. Furthermore, we find that the bouquet is required not only for proper spindle formation, but also for attachment of meiotic chromosomes to the spindle via their centromeres. Using molecular genetics, quantitative live analysis and biochemistry, we propose to define the mechanisms by which the gathered telomeres control spindle behavior. We will also investigate what aspect of the telomere confers proper centromere-spindle attachment and what goes wrong at centromeres in cells lacking the bouquet. These studies will illuminate mechanisms of communication between chromosomes and the spindle apparatus that should be widely conserved among eukaryotes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,451,943</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TERNANOMED"><Rcn>94409</Rcn><Nid>12698</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; Paris-Sud, France</HI><Name>TERPENOYLATION: AN ORIGINAL CONCEPT FOR THE DISCOVERY OF NEW NANOMEDICINES</Name><PI>Patrick Couvreur</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Terpenoids are a group of natural compounds that are extraordinary diverse in chemistry, structure and function. Most of the natural terpenoids are flexible and biocompatible biopolymers, having physico-chemical characteristics able to adapt to a wide variety of biologically active compounds. Surprisingly, they have never been used previously in the nanotechnology field for drug delivery and targeting purposes, except very recently by us to design squalene-based nanoassemblies. Thus, the current project aims to develop terpenoid-based nanoassemblies to improve the treatment of severe diseases incl. cancer, infectious and metabolic diseases. The conceptual approach is to chemically link a terpenoid to a biologically active drug molecule in order to allow the resulting bioconjugate to self-assemble as nanoparticles in water. Noteworthy, the nature of the polyterpenoid (ie. number of isoprenoid units) may be adapted to the hydrophilic/lipophilic character of the drug molecule to be transported, whereas the nature of the linkage (ester, amide, disulfide bonds etc.) will be selected according to the enzymatic content of the targeted diseased area. From the ratio between drug s and polyterpene s molecular weights, it is deduced that the drug loading will be dramatically improved as compared to the currently available nanomedicines. In other words, the pro-drug will form the nanomedicine by selfaggregation without the need of any other transporter material. The project will involve the following interdisciplinary aspects:(i) synthesis of drug/polyterpene bioconjugates,(ii)design of the nanoassemblies and their functionalization with recognition ligands,(iii)cell and tissue imaging and(iv)pharmacological evaluation in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo.

Telomeric DNA is maintained by the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase. Most normal human somatic cells express only very low levels of telomerase and telomeres shorten with continuous cell division cycles. Ultimately, short telomeres activate a DNA damage response that leads to a permanent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Reactivation of telomerase is a key requisite for human cancer cells to attain unlimited proliferation potential.    The key questions that need to be tackled in the telomere field are (1) how telomeres protect from DNA repair activities, (2) how recruitment and regulation of telomerase is mediated by telomere structure, (3) how cell cycle arrest occurs upon telomere shortening, and (4) how telomeres regulate their heterochromatic state. In all four areas, important progress is expected in the near future.   We recently made the unexpected discovery that telomeres are transcribed into TElomeric Repeat containing RNA (TERRA) and that this RNA is an integral part of telomeric heterochromatin. Our working hypothesis is that the telomere is an RNA-dependent machine, and that several if not most of its crucial functions are regulated by TERRA. In this proposal we will explore TERRA functions, by elucidating its biogenesis, by identifying its protein partners and by genetic manipulation of the expression of TERRA and TERRA binding proteins. This work should provide fundamental insight into how our chromosome ends function. The gained knowledge may also provide novel avenues on how to manipulate telomere function and dysfunction in cancer cells and other diseased tissue.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,385,047</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TERRAINCOGNITA"><Rcn>94139</Rcn><Nid>11396</Nid><HI>Universitaetsspital Basel, Switzerland</HI><Name>T cell receptor &#206;&#177;&#206;&#178;: in control of signal initiation and T cell fate</Name><PI>Ed Palmer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>One of the central mysteries of immunology is self-tolerance. How does the human body select ~10e12 T lymphocytes, that are reactive to foreign pathogens but tolerant to normal cellular constituents of the host? Over the last few years, my laboratory identified 2 fundamental mechanisms used by thymocytes to establish T cell tolerance. We demonstrated that the affinity threshold for negative selection is a constant for all thymocytes expressing MHC I restricted TCRs. This binding affinity threshold (KD H 6 &#194;&#188;M; estimated T1/2 H 2 sec) is the fundamental biophysical parameter used by TCRs to delete autoimmune T cells. We also established how the TCR generates distinct signals for positive and negative selection. At the selection threshold, a small increase in ligand affinity for the T-cell antigen receptor leads to a marked change in the activation and subcellular localization of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling intermediates. The ability to compartmentalize signaling molecules differentially within the cell endows the thymocyte with the ability to convert a small change in analogue input (affinity) into a digital output (positive versus negative selection) and provides the molecular basis for central tolerance. In the present application, we plan to fully understand 1-how the biophysical events during antigen binding to the TCR initiate an intracellular signal; 2-how these signals program an unambiguous cell fate and 3-how the system fails, when an autoimmune T cell is generated and activated. We will use a combination of transgenic and knockout mice, biochemistry and molecular imaging to fully define how the TCR functions as a molecular switch.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,930,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="THCB2011"><Rcn>104484</Rcn><Nid>8784</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The evolution and development of cooperation in mammalian societies</Name><PI>Timothy Hugh Clutton-Brock</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"The aim of this project is to understand the distribution and evolution of cooperative behaviour and social organisation in mammals.

Our system model is the Natural Killer (NK) cell. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms by which these players of innate immunity achieve tolerance to self and participate to immune responses. Multidisciplinary approaches will be combined to achieve groundbreaking results at nanoscopic and macroscopic scales on the following issues:
- How NK cells are educated to self-tolerance?
- How NK cells distinguish their targets from normal cells?
- How NK cells participate to immunological memory?
THINK (THe Immune function of Natural Killer cells) is a challenging project supported by an array of preliminary data obtained by our team of investigators in various fields of expertise:
- innate immunity and NK cells in human and mouse models
- random insertional mutagenesis in the mouse
- genome-wide epigenetic, transcriptomic and RNAi analysis and
- state-of-the-art optical imaging techniques from intravital biphoton microscopy to the quantification of proteins in nano-sized areas of the cell.
THINK is thus a multidisciplinary project that bridges disciplines: immunology, biophysics, genetics and epigenetics. In a scientific perspective, we think that this project will open new technological and scholar horizons, in reassessing the actual concepts on the links between innate immunity, tissue homeostasis and stress response. In a clinical and translational perspective, we also think that this project will help to design innovative NK cell-based therapies and immunomonitoring protocols.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TICE"><Rcn>89111</Rcn><Nid>12053</Nid><HI>Universitetet I Tromsoe, Norway</HI><Name>TRANSCRIPTOMICS IN CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY</Name><PI>Eiliv Lund</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>NOWAC is the first prospective study with a globolomic design. This is an extension of the current cohort study with its questionnaire information and biological material for analysis of biomarkers, proteomics and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The design of NOWAC adds biological material for analysis of the transcriptome in prospectively collected buffered peripheral blood samples, the postgenome biobank. Further, both peripheral blood and tumor tissue are collected from breast cancer patients diagnosed within the cohort together with matched controls. The latter biological material gives a new multidimensional design with a unique biological material at the end-point. The transcriptomic analysis will include both mRNA and miRNA as new technology (microarray and massive parallel sequencing) allows large scale studies. miRNAs could be promising markers for pathways analysis related to the carcinogenic process and for diagnosis and screening tests of breast cancer. These high-troughput technologies have analyses challenges both in bioinformatics and biostatistics therefore success depends on the development of new analytical strategies.This novel design is the observational counterpart to systems biology, or systems epidemiology. Systems epidemiology will seek to understand biological processes by integrating observational derived pathways information into the current prospective design. A true interdisciplinary approach has been implemented. The upside is the potential for an improved understanding of causality in epidemiology by opening up for quantification of traditional criteria of biological plausibility in a more complete biological model.  The postgenome biobank with 50 000 participants out of the 172 000 participants in NOWAC and its unique national design and richness of biological material makes it a very strong case for interdisciplinary collaboration based on a population-based study representative of the real and complex lifestyle environment.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,300,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TIMESIGNAL"><Rcn>94143</Rcn><Nid>11534</Nid><HI>Universit&#195;&#169; De Gen&#195;&#168;ve, Switzerland</HI><Name>Signalling within the mammalian circadian timing system</Name><PI>Ulrich Schibler</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The main objective of this interdisciplinary research project is to elucidate regulatory mechanisms through which the circadian timing system coordinates temporal physiology. This system has a hierarchical architecture, in that a master clock in the brain s suprachiasmatic nucleus synchronizes subsidiary oscillators in nearly all body cells. The establishment of phase coherence is obviously of utmost importance in the coordination of circadian physiology. While recent studies have identified feeding cycles, hormone rhythms, and body temperature oscillations as timing cues for peripheral clocks, the molecular makeup of the involved signalling mechanisms is largely unknown. Using liver and cultured cells as model systems, we will employ two innovative strategies for the elucidation of relevant signalling pathways. (1) STAR-Prom (Synthetic TAndem Repeat-PROmoter display), a technique developed in our laboratory, will hopefully identify most if not all immediate early transcription factors activated in cultured cells by rhythmic blood-borne and temperature-dependent signals. (2) A transgenic mouse model with conditionally active liver clocks will be explored in the genome-wide identification of coding and non-coding transcripts whose rhythmic accumulation is system-driven. The in vivo significance of the components emerging from these approaches will be assessed via RNA interference. Thus, relevant siRNAs will be injected into the tail vein of mice, and their effect on the phase of circadian liver gene expression will be monitored in freely moving mice by using whole body fluorescence imaging. Physiologically important components will serve as entry points for the identification of upstream and downstream constituents in the corresponding signal transduction cascades.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,360,136</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TOPAS"><Rcn>89289</Rcn><Nid>9849</Nid><HI>Julius-Maximilians Universitaet Wuerzburg, Germany</HI><Name>Towards the Quantal Nature of Receptor/cAMP Signals</Name><PI>Martin Lohse</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Most drugs act via cell surface receptors. Some receptors signal to ion channels, while others regulate 2nd messengers, most importantly cAMP. Ion channels can be resolved at the single channel level using patch clamp analysis; they switch between discrete ""on"" and ""off"" states. In contrast, current techniques to analyze cAMP-signals are quite global and generally require destruction of the sample. Therefore, the activation mechanisms and switching behaviour of receptors signalling to cAMP are largely unknown. This project postulates minimal quantal cAMP-signals that are triggered by individual receptors. We aim to discover these quantal cAMP-signals, to characterize their temporal and spatial patterns, and to determine factors that influence them. To do so, we will develop a microscopic technology to image cAMP-signals with high sensitivity and resolution. We have already developed a first generation of cAMP-sensors that can be expressed in cells and respond to cAMP with a change in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We will carry this technology to the sensitivity required for the postulated quantal cAMP-signals and - develop new FRET-sensors for cAMP with much greater brightness, amplitude and sensitivity, - build a specially designed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope to image the sub-membrane region of intact cells, - apply the technology to systems of increasing biological complexity: (a) isolated thyroid cells, where cAMP-signals can be compartmentalized, (b) intact thyroid follicles, where cAMP-signals can be triggered from various cellular sites, and (c) individual neurons in Drosophila brain, which are involved in a defined learning process. We believe that the ability to analyze 2nd messenger responses from individual receptors will open the way to a molecular understanding of receptor function and cAMP-signalling and provide a widely applicable technology and a mechanistic basis for receptor-directed drug development."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,493,358</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRACTAR"><Rcn>98705</Rcn><Nid>9128</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Tracking and Targeting a T-DNA Vector for Precise Engineering of Plant Genomes</Name><PI>Avraham Albert Levy</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>DNA introduced into a cell usually integrates, if at all, at random in the genome. In order for gene targeting to take place, a small vector must scan a huge genome that is packaged in chromatin, identify and bind the target, and engage in strand exchange. This formidable task is likely to be rate limiting. Our goal is to study the process of genome scanning by the vector, to track it from the time of transformation through genome integration and to assist the vector to identify the homologous target.  Our tools are particle imaging and tracking, molecular analysis of integration events, and manipulation of the integration process through protein recognition chemistry. Two main approaches will be used to assist homologous integration: first, by protein bridging (proteins that would bind both target and vector), and second by chromatin remodeling. Second, we propose to analyze the connection between chromatin structure and DNA integration. We will analyze how nucleosome positioning affects patterns of DNA integration. In addition, we will stimulate chromatin remodeling in an attempt to facilitate target invasion by the incoming vector. Parallel assays will be built upon fluorescence and genetic markers to correlate between the mode of search and integration per se.

DNA damage in genes can give rise to harmful mutations, but it can also directly obstruct the progress of transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), thereby blocking gene expression. Not surprisingly, repair pathways have evolved that specifically target lesions that stop RNAPII during its journey across a gene, so-called transcription-coupled repair pathways. As an alternative and &#194;&#191;last resort&#194;&#191;, damage-stalled RNAPII can also be permanently removed by ubiquitylation/degradation, clearing the gene for repair by other means. Together, transcription-coupled repair and RNAPII ubiquitylation constitute an essential axis in the response to DNA damage.
Conversely, while transcription is essential and therefore protected by a variety of mechanisms, it also itself comes at a cost for genome integrity. For example, high levels of transcription are correlated with breaks at fragile chromosome sites, mutagenesis and elevated levels of DNA recombination. Research into how the genome-destabilizing effects of transcription are minimized is still at an early stage, but insight into this research area is essential for our general appreciation of the regulatory mechanisms at play in the interface between transcription and other DNA-related processes, as well as for the understanding of processes underlying genome instability.
This proposal describes how funding from the ERC will enable us to use a multi-disciplinary approach to shed new light on fundamental and disease-relevant processes, which are crucial for maintaining genome integrity during active transcription.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,950,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRANSIT"><Rcn>98645</Rcn><Nid>8921</Nid><HI>Max Planck Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Wissenschaften E.v., Germany</HI><Name>Mechanism of Regulated Transcription Initiation</Name><PI>Patrick Cramer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"The regulation of gene transcription governs eukaryotic cell growth and differentiation. Despite its importance, transcription regulation is not understood at a mechanistic level. Regulation occurs mainly during initiation, when the enzyme RNA polymerase II (Pol II) assembles with ~50 polypeptides on promoter DNA. Regulatory signals are transmitted by the 25-subunit Mediator, and convert the initiation complex into a productive elongation complex. Ten years after the solution of the Pol II structure (Cramer et al., Science 2000, 2001), elongation is understood, but the structure and regulatory control of the initiation complex remain largely unknown. Here I propose to solve this central problem of molecular genetics and obtain a movie that shows how a gene is activated. Our recent structure of Pol II with initiation factor TFIIB (Kostrewa et al. Nature 2009) provides the starting point for the proposed risky and challenging structure-function analysis of regulated initiation. First, we will determine structures of Pol II in the initiating state. Second, we will solve the structure of the essential, gene-regulatory 7-subunit head module of the Mediator core. Third, we will establish &#194;&#191;nascent transcriptome analysis&#194;&#191; as a novel technique that measures mRNA synthesis rates globally, and will use it to probe the mechanisms of regulated initiation by structure-based mutagenesis in vivo. Expected results will open new horizons for investigating the function of eukaryotic genomes, and will have a strong impact on biomedicine, since deregulated transcription underlies many diseases, including cancers and certain metabolic dysfunctions.

I will overcome this situation by exploiting two biological facts. First, RNAs that are important in tissue function are a subset of the global mass, but are always associated with the ribosomal machinery and as such should be identified. Second, gene expression is the outcome of dynamic fluctuations that with time create a unique expression pattern. We need to dynamically label cell populations that undergo stress and follow them to generate a gene expression signature. To achieve my goal, I will consider: 1. Translational stress generated by viral infection or accumulation of misfolded proteins; 2. human CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets which are key to orchestrate immune responses; 3. EIF6 model of metabolic reprogramming.
1. Activation of eIF2alpha phosphorylation by viral infection generates a translational response in which silent mRNAs containing upstream ORFs (uORF) are translated. I will exploit this observation to construct the first in vivo reporter model of translational stress. We will label genetically cells that have translational stress, to identify all the changes that a single cell undergoes after viral infection/accumulation of undegraded proteins.
2. I will selectively sequence for the first time mRNAs and ncRNAs associated with the ribosomal machinery in human cells with a defined functional status.
3. Spectacular data have shown that translation factor eIF6 regulates tumorigenesis by inducing a profound metabolic reprogramming. This observation suggests that, in vivo, translation acts upstream of transcription. We will model how a short translational input results in a complex epigenetic change.

This will assist key stage decision making before costly clinical trials are commenced. Skin diseases represent a significant health burden. Non-melanoma skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most common human malignancies. Genetic skin diseases, or genodermatoses, are heritable conditions comprising nearly 300 distinct often rare clinical entities, which affect ~30M people in Europe i.e. ~7% of the entire population (http://geneskin.idi.it/homepgs/rareg.php). Thus, genodermatoses have important medical and social implications and have very limited therapeutic possibilities. This proposal will develop preclinical models which can be used to identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of skin cancer and to explore novel approaches to gene and cell therapy. Organotypical tissue engineered skin constructs combining normal, malignant and diseased epithelial, mesenchymal and connective tissue elements will first be used to examine the effect of tumour microenvironment on cancer cell invasion. Then constructs mimicking 1. intraepithelial, 2. well and 3. poorly differentiated SCCs will be used as surface xenotransplants. Optimisation will examine the contribution of adipocyte and mesenchymal stem cells. A set of genes identified as a characteristic SCC signature by extensive previous studies will then be genetically manipulated to examine the effects of up and down regulation of these genes in tumour progression and invasion. The effects of novel small molecules will also be tested. Surface xenotransplants of organotypical cultures of genetically diseased keratinocytes will be established to assess the long term outcomes of comparing ex vivo gene therapy with protein and cell therapy.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,999,999</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TREEPEACE"><Rcn>111590</Rcn><Nid>8734</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Recherche Agronomique, France</HI><Name>From Holocene to Anthropocene: the pace of microevolution in trees</Name><PI>Antoine Kremer</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"There are widespread concerns that trees, due to their long life-span, are not able to cope with the rapid ongoing climate change.

This project challenges these views and explores the pace at which evolutionary change has taken place during past gradual and under current rapid environmental change.  It builds on the reconstruction of evolutionary trajectories during the Holocene and Anthropocene to infer evolutionary rates, taking temperate oaks as a case study. The project assembles insights and contributions from paleobotany, ecology, ecophysiology, genetics, genomics and evolution in a generic framework for the assessment and prediction of rates of evolution at different hierarchical levels (genome to phenome).

This process generates ""transgressive"" traits that are outside the parental range. Transgressive phenotypes  in hybrids may involve complementation of genetic differences between the two parents, heterozygous advantage, genetic rearrangements and, from our recent work, epigenetic effects associated with RNA silencing.
TRIBE will investigate these effects using tomato for which there is a recently published full genome sequences and for which there are well characterised genetic resources based on hybrids between cultivated tomato and its wild relatives. We propose to map the genome and epigenome of F2-F4 generation hybrids between S. lycopersicum and its wild relative S. pennelli and, in parallel, to find out the level of expression of all genes including those producing small silencing RNAs. These data will provide the first systematic analysis of genomes, their expression and epigenetic modifications in the four post hybridisation generations.
TRIBE will also explore details of epigenetic mechanisms associated with transgressive traits with a view to their enhancement or suppression to facilitate conventional plant breeding involving wide crosses between crops and their wild relatives. It will also explore the possibility that there is a legacy of epigenetic marks in tomato that have been induced by ancestral hybridisation events.
The final outcome of TRIBE will be a test of the hypothesis that hybridisation is important in evolution because it allows not only the formation of new combinations of genes: it is also a process that induces new heritable variation via epigenetic and RNA silencing based mechanisms. It will generate information that will be central to the the exploitation of hybrids in breeding of crops.It will also generate new information about evolutionary mechanisms that can be integrated into our understanding of the tree of life."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,487,857</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TRIPOD"><Rcn>108480</Rcn><Nid>10849</Nid><HI>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, France</HI><Name>Deciphering the regulatory T cell repertoire: towards biomarkers and biotherapies for autoimmune diseases</Name><PI>David Robert Klatzmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is a breakthrough in immunology: it revolutionises our understanding of autoimmune disease (AID) pathophysiology and treatment opportunities. Treg numbers or function is defective in most mouse and human AIDs and their restoration induces clinical improvement, as we recently showed using low-dose IL-2 to induce Tregs in patients with AID.
The TRiPoD project is based on 3 well supported assertions:
- Tregs have huge therapeutic potential
- Deep understanding of the Treg T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is key to exploiting this potential
- Deep sequencing technologies required for this purpose have come of age
TRiPoD aims (i) to decipher the Treg repertoire against insulin and myelin at high resolution, (ii) to discover biomarkers for AIDs, and (iii) to develop therapies based on engineered Tregs.
Deep sequencing of TCRs from insulin- and myelin-specific Tregs generated in vitro will identify dominant TCRs and antigen-specific Treg signatures. These will be analysed during thymocyte differentiation, at steady state and during disease progression, in mice and humans. Their potential as biomarkers (e.g. a Treg TCR specific for insulin for monitoring type 1 diabetes [T1D]) will be tested in experimental models and in clinical trials of IL-2 in T1D and multiple sclerosis (MS).
We will also generate antigen-specific Tregs expressing the dominant TCRs and investigate their therapeutic properties.
Ultimately, TRiPoD will contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of T1D and MS, identify novel biomarkers for the follow-up of patients at high risk of, or with T1D or MS, and generate novel therapeutics for clinical development.
More generally, our results and new approaches developed in TRiPoD should pioneer biomarker discovery and biotherapies in other immunopathologies.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TROJA"><Rcn>90167</Rcn><Nid>13108</Nid><HI>Aarhus Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>Targeting Receptors Of Jointly Assembled Ligand-Drug Constructs</Name><PI>S&#195;&#184;ren Kragh Moestrup</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The TROJA proposal is an investigative bioengineering study of the exploitation of specific endocytic receptors for targeting small molecule drugs to specific cells in order to improve medical therapy. This is a new approach with scientific roots in the basic research on endocytic receptors and protein expression carried out in the laboratory of the applicant. The major line of the proposal concerns the construction of combinatory drugs for targeting the haptoglobin (Hp)-hemoglobin receptor CD163 (Kristiansen et al., Nature 409:198-201) expressed in the monocyte-macrophage system. The platform may apply to a broad spectrum of diseases such as inflammatory diseases, various infections and certain cancers which all have CD163-expressing macrophages or malignant derivatives as key cell type in the pathogenesis of the disease. Dependent of the above-mentioned diseases to be treated, the drugs are intended to have anti-inflammatory, microbiotic or cytostatic effects. Efficacy of the combinatory drug will be investigated in monocytes/macrophages, CD163-transfected cells and as well as in suitable animal models including transgenic animals. Another and minor line of the proposal concerns the construction of combinatory drugs for targeting a very recently discovered Hp-Hb receptor expressed in trypanosomes (Vanhollebeke et al., Science, in press) causing sleeping sickness. Both lines of this research proposal will take advantage of established recombinant protein expression methods and chemical coupling technology to construct jointly assembled ligand-drugs complexes. In terms of drug efficacy and toxicity, the aim is to design combinatory products that remain largely inactive in their receptor-binding form, but upon release in the cells or parasites the active small molecule components become active. The discovery of such a Trojan horse platform for cellular drug entry may have major implications for future drug development and for new applications of existent drugs.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,400,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2014-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TUDOR"><Rcn>94130</Rcn><Nid>11305</Nid><HI>Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany</HI><Name>Towards Understanding the Structure and Dynamics of Receptor Proteins</Name><PI>Klaus Peter Hofmann</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"Upon binding an agonist, the seven transmembrane (TM) helical bundle of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) undergoes conformational changes that catalyze nucleotide exchange within bound G proteins. In rhodopsin, the agonist arises from light-induced isomerization of the retinal ligand, but an active conformation (Ops*) can also be adopted by the opsin apoprotein. We recently solved the structure of Ops* in complex with a peptide from the C-terminal &#194;&#177;-5 helix of the G protein. Considering this structure and previous work, we postulate a mechanism by which the 40 &#195;&#133; gap between the retinal and the nucleotide binding site is bridged. First, TM5 and TM6 engage in new interactions to form a mitt-like structure into which the G-protein &#194;&#177;-5 helix can bind. Second, the bound &#194;&#177;-5 helix switches into a new position, thereby acting as a transmission rod to the nucleotide binding site. In the proposed project, we will test this mechanism and explore the underlying protein dynamics by: - determining the structure of the receptor in complex with longer peptides, and if possible, with the G holoprotein, - measuring conformational changes on the timescale of receptor activation (ms) and expand computational modelling of the respective transitory complexes, - determining the underlying backbone dynamics and fluctuations on the ps-ns time scale by experimentation and molecular dynamics. Some of the necessary methodologies are available, while others must be developed or made available through collaborations. Rhodopsin is the ideal model system for studying signal transduction mechanisms. Our novel multi-prong approach, while risky, will enormously improve our understanding of GPCR signalling mechanisms.

Current cardiovascular and cancer therapies are often insufficient, unsuccessful or not suitable for all patients. Inhibition of angiogenesis is already used in the clinics, but with limited success. On the other hand, stimulation of the growth of blood vessels, angiogenesis, and of arteriogenesis, the growth of (collateral) arteries, has been unsuccessfully tried for the treatment of tissue ischemia. The aim of this research plan is to reveal new disease-related functions of endothelial growth factors and their signal transduction in cancer and cardiovascular disease and to establish preclinical models of effective therapy based on new knowledge of the biology of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), angiopoietins (Ang), angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. We will embark on new studies based on our novel discoveries on the crosstalk between endothelial growth factor pathways in tumor angiogenesis, the involvement of lymphatic vessels in the development of obesity and associated inflammation, and on the striking effects of VEGF-B on cardiac muscle and vessels. We will develop molecular genetic and iPS cell derived models, and use functional genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, viral gene delivery and blocking reagents from human antibody libraries for our studies that should be of high priority in basic science and medicine.

In this process, the molecules are released upon stimulation by a nanomachine forming a fusion pore that connects the vesicular lumen to the extracellular space. Similar fusion events are also essential for intracellular transport mechanisms and virus-induced fusion.
Here I propose a multidisciplinary approach using highly innovative techniques to determine the nanomechanical mechanism of fusion pore formation. The proposal is based on the hypothesis that the vesicle fusion nanomachine is formed by the mechanical interactions of the SNARE proteins synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 and that the fusion pore is opened by intra-membrane movement of the transmembrane domains. I will combine fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy with detection of individual fusion events using microfabricated electrochemical detector arrays to demonstrate that fusion pore formation is produced directly by a conformational change in the SNARE complex. I will estimate the energies that are needed to pull the synaptobrevin C terminus into the hydrophobic membrane core and the forces that are generated by the SNARE complex for wild type and a set of specific mutations using molecular dynamics simulations. I will determine how these energies and forces relate to inhibition and facilitation of experimentally observed fusion, performing patch clamp capacitance measurements of vesicle fusion in chromaffin cells expressing wild type and mutated SNARE proteins. Based on these results I will develop a detailed picture of the molecular steps, the energies, and the forces exerted by the molecular nanomachine of fusion pore formation and will ultimately generate a molecular movie of this fundamental biological process.

The ability to switch between diverse modes of migration enables tumors to adapt to micro-environmental conditions and to metastasize. The critical pathways and cellular processes underlying the plasticity of tumor cell motility have only begun to be identified.
Endocytosis, originally thought of as a device to internalize nutrients and membrane-bound molecules, is emerging as a connectivity infrastructure (which we call ""the Endocytic Matrix"") of different cellular networks necessary for the execution of various cellular programs. A primary role of the Endocytic Matrix is the delivery of space- and time-resolved signals to the cell, and it is thus essential for the execution of polarized functions during cell migration. The molecular mechanisms it uses are, however, ill defined and likely to involve, in addition to extranuclear pathways, also transcriptional programs. In this respect, we have acquired evidence that components of the Endocytic Matrix require de novo gene expression to promote the transition in the mode of tumor cell motility.
We propose to identify critical components of the Endocytic Matrix that by controlling the cellular location of actin remodellers promote the plasticity of tumor cell migration. We will also test whether, in addition to the immediate epigenetic/signalling-based control of migration, the Endocytic Matrix regulates transcriptional programs required for the acquisition or maintenance of diverse modes of motility. Finally, in view of the key role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer, we will use miRNA profiling, together with endocytic cell migration and invasion assays in human cancer cells to test whether miRNAs mediate the relationship between endocytosis and motility programs."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,232,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TiMORPH"><Rcn>185437</Rcn><Nid>12355</Nid><HI>Institut Curie, France</HI><Name>Morphogenesis of proliferative epithelial tissue</Name><PI>Yohanns Bellaiche</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Shape is a conspicuous and fundamental property of living multicellular organisms. Questions related to embryo shape or morphogenesis have naturally haunted developmental biologists for decades. Recent advances have highlighted that the understanding of the morphogenesis of proliferative tissue will require (i) the dissection of how subcellular cytoskeleton dynamics controls cellular processes such as cell division orientation and adherens junction formation; (ii) the study of the interplay between biochemical and mechanical processes regulating collective cell behaviours and thus tissue movements. In addition, whole tissue imaging has revealed that distinct local cell dynamics account for tissue shape regulation. Yet, it remains poorly explored how gene expression patterns specify distinct local cell dynamics within a proliferative epithelium. To decipher the mechanisms of Drosophila epithelial tissue morphogenesis, we aim to apply a series of complementary, state of the art methods (quantitative measurement of cell and tissue morphogenesis, mechanical stress inference, opto-genetics, computer simulation and advanced statistics) in order to:
1. Dissect the molecular and mechanical mechanisms regulating cytoskeleton and cell dynamics by focusing on mitotic spindle orientation and de novo adherens junction formation during cell division and cell rearrangement.
2. Link cytoskeleton organization, cell dynamics and mechanics to the regulation of large-scale tissue deformation.
3. Introduce a &#226;&#128;&#152;morphogenomics&#226;&#128;&#153; approach to understand how combinatory gene expression patterns can account for distinct cell dynamics observed in the different regions of a tissue.
By exploring the mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis at different time-scales and length-scales, as well as by focusing both on its genetic and mechanical regulation, these complementary aims should advance the understanding of morphogenesis in animals.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,419,521</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="TransReAct"><Rcn>89290</Rcn><Nid>8873</Nid><HI>Centre Europeen De Recherche En Biologie Et Medecine, France</HI><Name>TFIIH as a crucial actor in genome expression and repair</Name><PI>Jean-Marc Egly</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding how the genetic information of a cell is retrieved but also protected from insults, is a major challenge facing modern molecular biology. Indeed, one of the most important developments in human genetics over the last decade, has been the realization that diseases such as cancer but also ageing stem from some dis-regulation in the expression and preservation of the genetic information. TFIIH is a multiprotein complex that is essential in transcription and DNA repair. Mutations in some of its subunits are responsible of a UV sensitivity phenotype in yeast and drosophila. In human, this results in the rare DNA repair deficient genetic disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is characterized by photosensitivity and an increased risk of skin cancers. Two further disorders involving mutation in TFIIH subunits, Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) are also defective in repair of UV damage, but present quite different clinical features such as brittle hair, neurological and developmental retardation, middles sun sensitivity and no susceptibility to solar carcinogenesis. The clinical complexity of these syndromes cannot be explained solely by deficiencies in DNA repair and emerging evidences indicate that it may also result from a dys-regulation of the transcriptional program under the control of hormones. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the DNA repair/transcription disorders involving mutations in TFIIH. This research will not only assists afflicted XP, CS, TTD and normal individuals in prevention and ultimately cures of hormonal dependent diseases and cancer (the clinical point of view), but more generally will provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the expression of protein coding genes and the maintenance of genome integrity (the fundamental research point of view).</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,997,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Triple-BC"><Rcn>108208</Rcn><Nid>9602</Nid><HI>Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Netherlands</HI><Name>Identification and functional validation of drugable targets/pathways for triple negative breast cancer</Name><PI>Johannes Albert Foekens</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Patients suffering from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a poor prognosis as these tumors frequently confer resistance against chemotherapeutic agents and lack drug targets such as estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Insufficient knowledge on the biology of this specific breast tumor type and its heterogeneity  hinder the identification of potential novel drug targets. Lethality enhancer screening is an ideal approach to identify new drug targets in tumors with specific genetic aberrations. We plan to adapt this concept of synthetic lethality by anticipating that while TNBC cells confer resistance to available anticancer drugs, specific knock down of particular genes by RNA-interference (RNAi) may result in a synergistic cell killing. Another important aspect of our approach is that we will concentrate in our screens on the top 500 candidate genes shown to be crucial in TNBC for cellular processes. The genes will be prioritized by Bayesian network analysis on prior knowledge on clinical TNBC from our own extensive genomics and proteomics studies, the literature, next generation sequencing efforts, and databases listing drugability of targets. We will employ RNAi-based knock down of drugable targets in 22 cell lines to reveal genes essential for drug resistance in TNBC. In addition to 2D cultures, screens will also be applied to 3D cultures, which are thought to better reflect the in vivo situation. The most effective combinations for each TNBC subtype will further be functionally investigated in vitro and in vivo to unravel the molecular nature of the synthetic lethality. Finally, translational studies will be performed to establish the potential clinical relevance of the identified targets/pathways in large numbers of human TNBC and non-TNBC tumors on tissue microarrays. It is expected that the newly designed (combination) therapies result in a decline in TNBC mortality and reduction of healthcare costs.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,495,102</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="UB-DECODED"><Rcn>102711</Rcn><Nid>13180</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Deciphering the ubiquitin code of the TNF receptor signalling complex and its functional role in inflammation and immunity</Name><PI>Henning Walczak</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine with important functions in inflammation, immunity and cancer. Signalling processes mediated by ubiquitin are crucial for TNF signalling. The seven lysine (K) residues and the N-terminus of ubiquitin can be used to form ubiquitin chains. Employing a method newly developed in our laboratory we identified the presence of four of these ubiquitin chain linkage types in the native TNF receptor signalling complex (TNF-RSC). Our knowledge of the specific functions of the different ubiquitin linkages is currently very limited. However, their presence in the TNF-RSC, combined with our recent technological advance in dissecting the composition of this protein complex with previously unreached specificity and sensitivity provides a unique opportunity for the proposed research programme: to molecularly and functionally decipher the ubiquitin code. We will aim to achieve this by studying the different ubiquitin chain linkages at the molecular level within the TNF-RSC and by determining how perturbation of specific ubiquitin linkage events impacts the physiological role of TNF in immunity to infection and its pathological function in inflammation-induced cancer.

Different types of mono- and polyubiquitin chains determine the fate of target proteins by redirecting them for degradation, relocalization or interaction with new partners. The type of ubiquitin modification on any target is determined by the interplay between the conjugating E2/E3 complexes on the one hand and deubiquitinating enzymes on the other. In practice, it is the balance between conjugating and deconjugating systems that determines the result of the various ubiquitination signals. For three different regulatory systems that are critical for correct genome maintenance, we are now in a position to study not just the individual process of conjugation or deconjugation in isolation, but rather, reconstitute the entire reaction on a defined physiological target. These three target systems, histone H2A, PCNA and P53, can be mono-ubiquitinated by a defined E3-ligase, poly-ubiquitinated by a second ligase and deconjugated by defined deubiquitinating enzymes in a reaction that is affected by known allosteric modulators. Our unique collection of tools to study these systems in vitro allows reconstitution of the full reaction, to trap intermediates, and to study their interaction from atomic detail to kinetic reactivity. Using X-ray crystallography of critical intermediates and kinetic analysis of individual reactions by FRET and surface plasmon resonance, we can address how the mono-, poly and deubiquitinating reactions affect each other. By answering mechanistic questions on the relative effect of the forward and backward reaction components and their modulators we will provide a solid basis for drug design studies that target these pathways against cancer development.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,299,720</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="V-RNA"><Rcn>107009</Rcn><Nid>10895</Nid><HI>European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany</HI><Name>Two facets of viral RNA: mechanistic studies of transcription and replication by influenza-like viral polymerases and detection by the innate immune system</Name><PI>Stephen Anthony Cusack</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>"RNA viruses infect cells to replicate and repackage their genomes in progeny virions. In response, the cellular innate immune system detects viral RNA and triggers powerful anti-viral countermeasures. This proposal aims to elucidate atomic resolution molecular mechanisms associated with these conflicting interests, and will address the following questions: firstly, how do RNA polymerases of segmented, negative sense, single-stranded RNA viruses such as influenza and bunyaviruses transcribe and replicate viral RNA and secondly, how do RIG-I like helicases, intracellular, innate immune, pattern recognition receptors, selectively detect RNA only of viral origin, thus triggering interferon production and induction of the anti-viral state? A third, more exploratory part of the proposal will use proteomics analysis to identify all host factors that are bound to viral mRNAs in influenza virus infected cells. The interdisciplinary project will combine state-of-the-art structural biology with cell-based functional assays and global analysis. Results will advance fundamental understanding of polymerases and helicases, both complex RNA-dependent molecular machines, give new insight into the regulation of innate immune receptor activation and signalling, and shed new light on RNA metabolism in the perturbed environment of the infected cell. They will also impact virology and public health by bringing new knowledge on RNA virus-host interactions, virus evolution and inter-species transmission. More pragmatically the project will boost structure-based anti-viral drug development targeting serious and/or emerging human pathogens such as influenza A, which poses the perennial threat of a devastating pandemic, and the many disease causing bunyaviruses, which in a globally warming world could spread unpredictably. The V-RNA project thus forms a coherent whole covering important protagonists in the virus-versus-host-versus-virus molecular warfare centered around viral RNA."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,371,934</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="VARB"><Rcn>89084</Rcn><Nid>9596</Nid><HI>Weizmann Institute Of Science, Israel</HI><Name>Variability and Robustness in Bio-molecular systems</Name><PI>Naama Barkai</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS2, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Cells process information using biochemical networks of interacting proteins and genes.

The proposed study represents  a vascular-centred approach to  the neurovascular unit thriving to gain further insights on the many ways by which  blood vessels may affect proper brain functioning. Major focus is on the vascular stem cell niche, i.e. the contention that blood vessels are a key component of adult stem cell niches, including a niche securing proper function of neuronal stem cells (NSCs). Further insights on the niche are also critical for contemplated implementation of stem-cell based therapy. In this multidisciplinary study combining the fields of vascular biology, neurobiology, stem cell biology, and aging research, we harness unique transgenic methodologies to conditionally manipulate (via VEGF) the vasculature within the stem cell niches. We provide a first compelling proof that blood vessels at the niche indeed control stem cells properties and behaviour, evidenced by showing that mere expansion of the niche vasculature and independently of VEGF) increases dramatically adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process known to be associated with improved cognitive performance.  We will determine what aspects of stem cell biology are controlled by juxtaposed, directly contacting blood vessels and will identify signalling systems mediating the vascular/stem cell cross-talk.
Adult neurogenesis is known to rapidly decline with age and ways to sustain the process are highly desired.

Their accuracy overtakes that of the conventional diagnostics systems. They are used, alone or in combination with other imaging systems, such as CT or MRI. The current best detectors for PET are based on LSO crystals that are usually made of 4mm x 4mm x 10mm coupled to PMT, APD, or similar photon-sensitive device. At best, the FWHM that can be achieved at 511keV is around 10%. This limited energy resolution limits the ability to remove scattered events which are a significant noise contribution to the reconstructed image. The typical length (in the radial direction) of the LSO crystals is about 10mm, which implies a significant uncertainty of the impact point in the radial direction and this induces an error in the projection of the Line of Response. This error deteriorates the quality of the reconstructed image. Pixel-PET uses pixel solid-state-detector coupled to front end electronics. With this novel detector one can achieve the followings: 1- millimeter-size voxel, this means no more parallax effect and hence precise LOR; 2-FWHM energy resolution of less than 1% for 511keV photons. This allows us to eliminate most of the scattered events and thus keep the golden events; 3- Have adequate depth of absorption to achieve high detection efficiency (90%) for 511keV photon; 4- The modular detector has trapezoidal parallelepiped shape thus making it seamless compared to the existing PET system; 5- The conceptual design can be modified to construct a Flat panel detector (Gamma Camera); 6-The design is compatible with MRI making it ideal for Brain imaging.

Songbirds learn their songs from a tutor: they memorize a template of tutor song and compare their own song to that template until a good match is achieved. The existence of a song template in the songbird brain has been clearly demonstrated in deafening, isolation, and lesion experiments, and therefore the songbird is one of the best animal models for unravelling neural principles of template-based vocal learning.

Currently we know very little about neural mechanisms in the brain that support template-based learning. In songbirds, our knowledge about the template is limited to behavioural aspects that favour or hinder faithful imitation and to evidence about the brain areas in which the template is stored. Elusive about the template remains its neural representation, as well as the manner in which it is used for evaluating the plastic juvenile songs. Here we propose for the first time a set of experiments aimed at identifying neural mechanisms of template computations including template storage, template recall, and template-based evaluation of auditory feedback.

We test the hypothesis that during singing, juvenile birds recall a memory of tutor song and use that memory to analyze and evaluate their own songs. In the zebra finch, our goal is to find a neural correlate of this memory trace in higher auditory association areas.

Not only do they rely on the cells biosynthetic machinery, they exploit cellular processes for signaling, membrane trafficking, intra-cellular transport, nuclear import and export, molecular sorting, transcriptional regulation, etc. To access the full spectrum of host cell functions in the infection of three different viruses in an unbiased and systematic fashion, we will identify the critical host cell proteins needed by monitoring infection in human tissue culture cells after silencing individual genes using genome-wide siRNA libraries and large sub-libraries based on the human genome.   The three viruses are vaccinia virus (a poxvirus), human papilloma virus 16, and Uukuniemi virus (a bunyavirus). They are members of important but poorly analyzed pathogen families representing enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, RNA and DNA viruses, viruses that replicate in the nucleus and in the cytosol.

We recently demonstrated that dietary amino acids (AA) activate liver Estrogen Receptors (ER) and that, in case of food scarcity, the lowered circulating AA decrease liver ER activity and reduce IGF-1 synthesis with the consequent blockage of the estrous cycle.
Here, we hypothesize that in females liver ERa is also a sensor of the endogenous signalling induced by transitions among reproductive stages and a key organizer for the changes required to adapt energy metabolism to reproductive necessities. Thus, we propose that in mammals liver ERa is regulated by reproductive functions and that, in case of ovary malfunctioning, the altered estrogenic signalling causes metabolic impairment leading to local and perhaps systemic disruption of energy homeostasis.
To demonstrate our theory, we will explore: i) the molecular pathways activating liver ERa and the related ERa transcriptome by genome-wide analytical tools; ii) the hepatic metabolism and the systemic consequences of liver ER pharmacological and genetic manipulations by means of metabolomic technologies; iii) the association between altered signalling on liver ER and the onset of metabolic disorders; iv) the molecular interactions between ER and PPAR activity and the effect of estrogens on liver autophagy.
WAYS research is facilitated by a series of tools such as ER conditional KO, reporter mice, arrays of genes known as target of liver ERa, and others generated by our laboratory in collaboration with EU groups in previous EU programs.
The vision of the liver as a functional unit with reproductive organs constitutes a paradigm shift in our understanding of woman physiology; thus, the full comprehension of liver ERa activity and regulation will be a critical step for the conception of new therapies for several diseases affecting women including the metabolic syndrome or the non-alcoholic steatosis."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,445,381</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="WEG"><Rcn>94774</Rcn><Nid>9986</Nid><HI>The University Of Edinburgh, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Wild Evolutionary Genomics</Name><PI>Josephine Mary Pemberton</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>"150 years since the Origin of Species, we do not know how natural selection acts at the level of the genome in natural populations in ecological time, but elucidation is within reach. This study will investigate natural selection, and the genome's response to it, in unprecedented detail by combining two resources. The Soay sheep population on the island of Hirta, St. Kilda, Scotland is one of the most thoroughly phenotyped wild animal populations in the world and already the subject of internationally famous interdisciplinary research. The recently developed International Sheep Genomics Consortium 60K chip identifies 38,777 single nucleotide polymorphisms in Soay sheep. We will genotype 5,000 Soays for these SNPs. We will first analyse the data to test the effect of realised relatedness and inbreeding coefficients on trait heritabilities, genetic correlations and inbreeding depression. We predict that all estimates will increase, generating much increased power for more complex studies. Second, we will identify genome regions harbouring quantitative trait loci (QTL) and inbreeding depression and genotype additional sheep at SNPs in haplotypes predicting this variation. We will subject these regions to intensive analyses to understand their genetic effects, the action of selection on them and their response to selection.

Several proteins, such as Wntless, are specifically devoted to Wnt secretion, indicating that Wnts may follow a distinct secretory route. Moreover, Wnts carry two lipid modifications, which are likely to interfere with diffusion in the extracellular space. Much of our work will focus on the trafficking of Wingless (the main Drosophila Wnt), which forms a concentration gradient in wing imaginal discs. To chart the route taken by Wingless from the ER to responding cells, we will devise techniques (e.g. BirA-dependent in vivo biotinylation) to pulse label endogenously expressed Wingless in the secretory pathway and at the cell surface. Wingless routing will also be investigated in conditions that alter Evi/Wntless trafficking. We will capitalize on our observation that Wingless and Wntless are present on exosomes in conditioned medium. These exosomes will be purified and characterized by mass spectrometry and the resulting information will be used to devise rigorous functional assays. Similar approaches will be used to identify and characterize proteins that associate with soluble Wingless, which is also present in conditioned medium. Our proposed approaches will also enable us to assess, for the first time, the function of exosomes in an intact animal. Once secreted, Wingless and associated proteins spread in the extracellular space while remaining associated with the epithelial surface. We will use single molecule imaging in a reconstituted system along with mathematical modeling to test the hypothesis that the glypican-Wnt interaction is sufficiently strong to ensure surface retention while allowing diffusion in two dimensions. Finally we will use biochemical approaches and molecular genetics in Drosophila and mice to investigate the mode of action of Notum, a glypican-modifying enzyme that could be relevant to the progression of Wnt signaling dependent cancers.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,938,846</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="WebOfLife"><Rcn>98704</Rcn><Nid>11248</Nid><HI>Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland</HI><Name>Robustness of The Web of Life in the Face of Global Change</Name><PI>Jordi Bascompte Sacrest</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>Recent work on complex networks has provided a theoretical framework to unravel the structure of the Web of Life. Yet, we still know little on the implications of network architecture for the robustness of beneficial network services such as pollination of crop plants. In this proposal, I intend to move beyond current studies of global environmental change that have mainly focused on its consequences for the abundance, phenology, and geographic distributions of independent species, to embrace effects for the network of interactions among species. My strategy to tackle this overall goal is through a synthetic and interdisciplinary approach that combines theory, meta-analysis, and experiment. First, I will integrate a large dataset of ecological networks with phylogenies and life-history traits to simulate the rate and shape of loss of functional groups. Second, I will set up an experimental design to address how two important ecosystem services, pollination and control of insect pests, decline with network disassembly. Third, I will explore early-warning signals of network collapse that may predict the proximity of a critical threshold in the driving forces of global change. My approach can provide a starting point for assessing the community-wide consequences of the current biodiversity crisis.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,700,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="Wnt for brain"><Rcn>99546</Rcn><Nid>12491</Nid><HI>Ifom Fondazione Istituto Firc Di Oncologia Molecolare, Italy</HI><Name>Transcriptional regulation of endothelial blood brain barrier differentiation by Wnt signaling</Name><PI>Elisabetta Dejana</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2010-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>The brain vasculature has evolved to protect the central nervous system from the constantly changing milieu in the blood stream. Endothelial cells of brain capillaries form the so called blood brain barrier (BBB), an active permeability barrier and transport system which allows a selective passage of nutrients from blood to the nervous tissue. The continuous cross talk of endothelial cells, pericytes and nervous cells influences many vascular functions and determines and maintains the BBB characteristics after birth. Our limited knowledge of the nature of these signals prevents effective therapy of several diseases such as hemorrhagic stroke or brain edema.  Furthermore, the development of tools to reversibly &#194;&#191;open&#194;&#191; the barrier would strongly improve drug delivery to the brain.
In the present project we propose to tackle the problem by studying the transcriptional mechanisms which direct BBB differentiation. This strategy is based on preliminary work which shows that the cross talk between nervous cells and the endothelium is mediated by Wnt factors and downstream beta-catenin transcriptional activity. The understanding of the mechanism of action of Wnt signaling on brain endothelium may yield novel strategies and tools for modulating BBB permeability.
The project is divided in three related objectives: 1) to define the mechanism of action and downstream partners of Wnt in brain angiogenesis and BBB differentiation; 2) to use this knowledge to develop an optimized BBB model in vitro and in vivo; 3) to test whether modulation of Wnt signaling may have a therapeutic impact in the regulation of BBB in pathological conditions.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,390,200</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2011-08-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-07-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="XENOTURBELLA"><Rcn>108776</Rcn><Nid>12823</Nid><HI>University College London, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The evolution of simplicity: comparative morphology, embryology and genomics of Xenacoelomorpha, the fourth phylum of deuterostome</Name><PI>Maximilian John Telford</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Understanding the origins and evolution of the highly diverse body plans of the ~30 distinct phlya that make up the animal Kingdom is a major programme in biology.  Recent research in my lab has demonstrated the existence of a new phylum of animals with a unique bodyplan - the Xenacoelomorpha - whose evolutionary origins are particularly surprising and highly contentious.
Our work has elevated these very simple worms from a lowly position at the base of the animal tree to a place right within a group of highly complex animals called the deuterostomes.  The deuterostome &#226;&#128;&#152;super-phylum&#226;&#128;&#153; includes three other major animal body architectures: the phyla Chordata (including Humans),  Echinodermata (starfish and sea urchins) and Hemichordata (acorn worms).
All species within the phylum Xenacoelomorpha appear to have lost almost all features that define them as deuterostomes implying a history of extreme evolutionary simplification and loss.   The research I propose aims to understand the extraordinary evolutionary path that led to this bizarre phylum of worms and give deep new insights into the origins of phyla.
We will use diverse techniques to study the morphology, ultrastructure, embryogenesis and developmental genetics of the Xenacoelomorpha to get a much clearer picture of the extent to which their phenotype is simplified.
In parallel we will undertake ab initio sequencing of  the genomes of three species of xenacoelomorphs and perform comparative genomics across all deuterostome phyla to discover the genotypic correlates of their phenotypic innovations.
In a reversal of the standard evolutionary approach which moves from morphology to genetics, we will use our genomes to discover the genetic novelties associated with all groups of deuterostome and then use data on gene function to link these novelties to their novel biological functions.
Our ultimate goal is to uncover the links between genotypic and phenotypic novelty in the evolution of the deuterostomes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,151,540</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="YIELD"><Rcn>101836</Rcn><Nid>10592</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Is there a limit to yield?</Name><PI>Daniel Zamir</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS9, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Plant breeders are challenged with sustaining global crop improvements.

By integrating in a single web-based platform of &#226;&#128;&#152;Phenom Networks&#226;&#128;&#153; a broad germplasm base, deep phenotypes, and multiple genome sequences of tomato species, we will identify the genes and mechanisms that dictate crop productivity and implement them in the creation of next generation F1 hybrids. Our work is founded on our years of efforts to establish the following integrated genetic pillars: 1) The tomato genome revealed SNPs for broader marker-assisted selection between cultivated parents and untapped diversity from closely-related red-fruited ancestors. We will develop new elite parental lines into which all discovered traits will be introduced. 2) We will enrich the narrow genetic base of modern processing tomato by pyramiding recessive, additive, dominant and overdominant QTL from six wild species introgression lines (ILs) and field-test them in diverse environments. 3) By producing hybrids with &#226;&#128;&#152;recessive&#226;&#128;&#153; deleterious mutants we have identified heterosis genes that increase yield by ~50%; these will be combined with the IL QTL. 4) Finally, we will focus on newly discovered &#226;&#128;&#156;stability QTL&#226;&#128;&#157; that significantly improve the reproducibility of yield effects by canalizing this phenotype in spite of environmental perturbations. This multi-faceted integrated tomato breeding effort will unite classical and genomics assisted methods with statistical genetics to demonstrate that yield barriers of the leading commercial hybrids are only there to be broken. We will clone the genes responsible for yield, domestication, heterosis, epistasis and canalization and explore their molecular action. I expect that the breeding concepts and methods developed through this project will lead the way to increased productivity of crops that are important for global food security.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="anammox"><Rcn>89171</Rcn><Nid>12809</Nid><HI>Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands</HI><Name>Anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria: unique prokayotes with exceptional properties</Name><PI>Michael Silvester Maria Jetten</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS8, ERC-2008-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>For over a century it was believed that ammonium could only be oxidized by microbes in the presence of oxygen. The possibility of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) was considered impossible. However, about 10 years ago the microbes responsible for the anammox reaction were discovered in a wastewater plant. This was followed by the identification of the responsible bacteria. Recently, the widespread environmental occurrence of the anammox bacteria was demonstrated leading to the realization that anammox bacteria may play a major role in biological nitrogen cycling. The anammox bacteria are unique microbes with many unusual properties. These include the biological turn-over of hydrazine, a well known rocket fuel, the biological synthesis of ladderane lipids, and the presence of a prokaryotic organelle in the cytoplasma of anammox bacteria. The aim of this project is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the metabolism and ecological importance of the anammox bacteria. Such understanding contributes directly to our environment and economy because the anammox bacteria form a new opportunity for nitrogen removal from wastewater, cheaper, with lower carbon dioxide emissions than existing technology. Scientifically the results will contribute to the understanding how hydrazine and dinitrogen gas are made by the anammox bacteria. The research will show which gene products are responsible for the anammox reaction, and how their expression is regulated. Furthermore, the experiments proposed will show if the prokaryotic organelle in anammox bacteria is involved in energy generation. Together the environmental and metabolic data will help to understand why anammox bacteria are so successful in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and thus shape our planets atmosphere. The different research lines will employ state of the art microbial and molecular methods to unravel the exceptional properties of these highly unusual and important anammox bacteria.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2009-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2013-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="astromnesis"><Rcn>110914</Rcn><Nid>10810</Nid><HI>Universite De Lausanne, Switzerland</HI><Name>The language of astrocytes: multilevel analysis to understand astrocyte communication and its role in memory-related brain operations and in cognitive behavior</Name><PI>Andrea Volterra</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>In the 90s, two landmark observations brought to a paradigm shift about the role of astrocytes in brain function: 1) astrocytes respond to signals coming from other cells with transient Ca2+ elevations; 2) Ca2+ transients in astrocytes trigger release of neuroactive and vasoactive agents. Since then, many modulatory astrocytic actions and mechanisms were described, forming a complex - partly contradictory - picture, in which the exact roles and modes of astrocyte action remain ill defined. Our project wants to bring light into the &#226;&#128;&#156;language of astrocytes&#226;&#128;&#157;, i.e. into how they communicate with neurons and, ultimately, address their role in brain computations and cognitive behavior. To this end we will perform 4 complementary levels of analysis using highly innovative methodologies in order to obtain unprecedented results. We will study: 1) the subcellular organization of astrocytes underlying local microdomain communications by use of correlative light-electron microscopy; 2) the way individual astrocytes integrate inputs and control synaptic ensembles using 3D two-photon imaging, genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators, optogenetics and electrophysiology; 3) the contribution of astrocyte ensembles to behavior-relevant circuit operations using miniaturized microscopes capturing neuronal/astrocytic population dynamics in freely-moving mice during memory tests; 4) the contribution of astrocytic signalling mechanisms to cognitive behavior using a set of new mouse lines with conditional, astrocyte-specific genetic modification of signalling pathways.

To be able to interfere with bacterial persistence it is vital to understand the molecular details of biofilm formation and to define how motile planktonic cells transit into surface-grown communities. The nucleotide second messenger cyclic di-guanosinemonophosphate (cdGMP) has emerged as a central regulatory factor governing bacterial surface adaptation and biofilm formation. Although cdGMP signaling may well represent the Achilles heel of bacterial communities, cdGMP networks in bacterial pathogens are exquisitely complex and an integrated cellular system to uncover the details of cdGMP dynamics is missing.
To quantitatively describe cdGMP signaling we propose to exploit Caulobacter crescentus, an organism with a simple bimodal life-style that integrates the sessile-motile switch into its asymmetric division cycle. We aim to: 1) identify the role and regulation of all diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases that contribute to the asymmetric cellular program with the goal to model the temporal and spatial distribution of cdGMP during development; 2) identify and characterize cdGMP effectors, their downstream targets and cellular pathways; 3) elucidate how cdGMP coordinates cell differentiation with cell growth and propagation; 4) unravel the role of cdGMP as an allosteric regulator in mechanosensation and in rapid adaptation of bacteria to growth on surfaces; 5) develop novel tools to quantitatively describe cdGMP network dynamics as the basis for mathematical modeling that provides the predictive power to experimentally test and refine important network parameters.

In contrast, we have recently discovered that most human colorectal cancers (CRCs) are composed of mixtures of phenotypically distinct tumor cells organized into a stem cell hierarchy that displays a striking resemblance to the healthy colonic epithelium. We showed that long-term regeneration potential of tumor cells is largely influenced by the position that they occupy within the tumor's hierarchy. To analyze the organization of CRCs without the constraints imposed by tumor cell transplantation experiments, we have developed a method that allows for the first time tracking and manipulating the fate of specific cell populations in whole human tumors. This technology is based on editing the genomes of primary human CRCs cultured in the form of tumor organoids using Zinc-Finger Nucleases to knock-in either lineage tracing or cell ablation alleles in genes that define colorectal cancer stem cells (CRC-SCs) or differentiated-like tumor cells. Edited tumor organoids generate CRCs in mice that reproduce the tumor of origin while carrying the desired genetic modifications. This technological advance opens the gate to perform classical genetic and developmental analysis in human tumors. We will exploit this advantage to address fundamental questions about the cell heterogeneity and organization of human CRCs that cannot be tackled through currently existing experimental approaches such as: Are CRC-SCs the only tumor cell population with long term regenerating potential? Can we cure CRC with anti-CRC-SC specific therapies? Will tumor cell plasticity contribute to the regeneration of the CRC-SC pool after therapy? Do quiescent-SCs regenerate CRC tumors after standard chemotherapy? Can we identify these cells? How do common genetic alterations in CRC influence the CRC hierarchy?

Interestingly, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binds to a subset of enhancers and produces transcripts, called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). These are produced bi-directionally and, in contrast to mRNAs and many other non-coding RNAs, are not polyadenylated. Generally, the transcription of eRNAs was shown to positively correlate with mRNA levels of surrounding protein-coding genes. However, it is unclear if eRNAs carry a transcriptional function.

p53 is a transcription factor and tumor suppressor that is very frequently mutated in cancer. Chromatin-binding profiles reveal specific interactions of p53 with promoter regions of nearby genes, within genes, but also with remote regions located more than 50 kbps away from any known gene. Interestingly, many of these remote regions possess evolutionary highly conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions, as well as binding of RNAPII. We found out that many remote p53-bound domains are indeed p53-dependent eRNA-producing enhancers, and, most importantly, eRNA production was required for transcriptional induction of distal genes and for p53-dependent cellular control.

Here we will:
1. Investigate in detail the mechanism of action and function of p53-dependent eRNAs.
2. Expand studies to identify eRNAs with oncogenic function.
3. Develop efficient ways to target eRNAs.
4. Target eRNAs and study their capacity to inhibit tumorigenicity.

As eRNAs are mediators of enhancer activity with sequence specific content and sensitivity to siRNA targeting, they might be the Achilles heel through which oncogenic enhancer activity could be suppressed.

The detection of this motion happens in equilibrium under physiological conditions without the need for a triggering reaction. On the example of ubiquitin, this dynamics was found by us to be important for molecular recognition between proteins implying conformational selection rather than induced fit. Only free solution ensembles including this dynamics accessed the full conformational heterogeneity of structures in recognition complexes. Molecular dynamics analysis suggests high correlation of these ns-ms dynamical modes. Here, we propose to establish with NMR experimentally the correlated nature of the ns-ms dynamics, to describe ensembles reflecting ns-ms and sub-ns dynamics by separating the time scales. In this context, using temperature jump-infra-red spectroscopy and solid state NMR we want to determine the time scale of the ns to ms motion more precisely. Since the ns-ms time scale is slower than diffusion, dynamics on this time scale could be a mechanism of regulating or limiting the kinetics of molecular association and recognition. Therefore, we want to determine on-rates by NMR spectroscopy and want to explore whether mutants that do not affect the binding interface but will affect the dynamics modulate the on-rates. This would allow the control of binding kinetics and explore the influence of ns-&#194;&#188;s dynamics on protein-protein recognition on the long run also for membrane proteins. In addition  specificity for drug interactions could be increased addressing extremal conformations present in the ns-&#194;&#188;s ensembles for homologous proteins with otherwise very similar average structures at interaction interfaces.

We propose to cross the large-scale proteomics and innate immunity disciplines to obtain a functionally annotated map of the molecular machinery involved in viral recognition and leading to the hallmark interferon response, through a three-pronged approach: 1. Map the interactome of innate immunity proteins in macrophages to establish the network of components leading to interferon production; 2. Chart the interactions of molecular patterns, mostly nucleic acids, to identify the receptors and sensors at the non-self/self interface; 3. Study viral pathogenicity factors as molecular jammers of the anti-viral response and elucidate their mode of action to uncover critical nodes (inhibitome). Datasets are integrated and released at regular intervals with embargoed windows allowing a network of collaborators/own laboratory to do in-depth validation. New components at data intersections will be tested through loss-of-function experiments and standardized read-outs for the interferon pathway as well as genetic association with autoimmune diseases. Because of its unbiased/large scope and its cross-validating approaches, wherein the newly mapped circuitry is modeled, challenged by inducers and perturbed by viral agents, i-FIVE has the potential to promote a systems-level understanding of the interferon branch of molecular innate immunity. This insight may in turn create medical opportunities for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, septic shoc, arthritis as well as in boosting anti-viral responses.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,974,022</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="iPLASTICITY"><Rcn>107244</Rcn><Nid>9546</Nid><HI>Helsingin Yliopisto, Finland</HI><Name>Induction of juvenile-like plasticity in the adult brain</Name><PI>Eero Castr&#195;&#169;n</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Neuronal networks are tuned to optimally represent external and internal milieu through neuronal plasticity during critical periods of juvenile life.  After the closure of the critical periods, plasticity is considered to be much more limited. In a series of landmark studies, we have shown that critical period-like plasticity can be reactivated in the adult mammalian brain by pharmacological treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine. These ground-breaking studies establish a new principle, induced juvenile-like plasticity (iPlasticity) and define a new class of drugs, iPlastic drugs. For optimal results, iPlastic drug must be combined with physical or psychological rehabilitation, which guide the plastic networks and together allow better adaptation towards changing environment.  iPlasticity may facilitate functional recovery after brain injury and underlie the enhanced efficacy of combined antidepressant treatment and psychotherapy.
We have uncovered iPlasticity as an exciting new concept and established experimental models to study the molecular, cellular and network level mechanisms underlying it.  We will here focus on the role of neurotrophin BDNF, because our previous and unpublished work clearly shows that BDNF and its receptors TrkB and p75 are essential and sufficient for iPlasticity.  We have found that a major developmental reorganization in TrkB signalling takes place coinciding with the end of critical periods, and its reversal may underlie iPlasticity.  We will utilize our resources as a leading lab in BDNF effects in adult brain and through novel controlled transgenic models, genomics and proteomics, we will reveal the role of BDNF signalling through TrkB and p75 in brain maturation, iPlasticity and brain disorders.  Understanding the neurobiological background of iPlasticity will be vital for iPlastic drug development and the numerous translational applications of iPlasticity clearly in sight.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="mitoCalcium"><Rcn>102666</Rcn><Nid>12141</Nid><HI>Universita Degli Studi Di Padova, Italy</HI><Name>Mitochondrial calcium signalling: molecules, roles and pharmacological targeting</Name><PI>Rosario Rizzuto</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS1, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is an important component of the calcium-mediated cellular response to extracellular stimuli. It controls key organelle functions, such as aerobic metabolism and the induction of apoptotic cell death, and shapes the spatio-temporal pattern of the cytosolic [Ca2+] increase. While its physiological and pathological relevance is now fully appreciated, lack of molecular insight has severely limited mechanistic understanding and pharmacological targeting. We have now identified the long sought &#226;&#128;&#156;mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter&#226;&#128;&#157; (MCU). This project stems from this ground-breaking result, and with a multidisciplinary approach investigates the biological role of MCU, tackling also its structure/function relationship and possible pharmacological exploitation. Specifically, the project will be divided in five major tasks: i) the elucidation of the subcellular distribution of MCU and of the supramolecular organization of the mitochondrial Ca2+ influx machinery; ii) the clarification of the cross-talk with other signaling pathways, with major focus on regulatory mechanisms based on post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation, oxidation); iii) the development of suitable heterologous systems, in which wild-type MCU or mutants can be expressed; the purified protein (or the isolated mitochondria) will be utilized in electrophysiological studies to investigate the functional properties of the channel; iv) the elucidation of the protein structure, with the aim of developing specific inhibitors, based on molecular modeling and crystallization of the protein produced in the appropriate heterologous system; v) the generation of conditional and tissue-specific knockout models for investigating MCU function in vivo; the analysis of the phenotype, including the sensitivity to genetic or environmental causes of disease, will provide insight into the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ dysregulation in the pathogenesis and treatment of human disorders.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,432,400</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="nano-Islands"><Rcn>107067</Rcn><Nid>12865</Nid><HI>Albert-Ludwigs-Universitaet Freiburg, Germany</HI><Name>NANOSCALE ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN ISLANDS ON LYMPHOCYTES</Name><PI>Gerd Michael Reth</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS6, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>To detect foreign invaders and to communicate with other cells of the immune system, B lymphocytes carry a multitude of receptor proteins on their surface. In the past, it was thought that most of these receptors are randomly distributed on the cell surface and only become organized upon lymphocyte activation. Recent studies showed, however, that many of these surface proteins are pre-organized in nanoscale protein islands (here called nano-islands) with a size of 50-150 nanometer (nm). We have developed a Fab-proximity ligation assay (Fab-PLA) which allows us to study the organization of membrane proteins at 10-20 nm distances. With this method, we discovered that the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) of the classes IgM and IgD are located in different class-specific nano-islands.
Due to the technical limitations of classical biochemistry (detergent lysis), light microscopy (diffraction limit of 250 nm) and electron microscopy (fixation artifacts), the nanoscale organization of membrane proteins is not well studied. With the Fab-PLA method, we can, for the first time, explore this unknown 200-20 nm space and analyze the composition and stability of the different nano-islands on the B cell surface. We also will develop new methods such as proximity biotinylation and proximity proteomics to better study these nanostructures and learn more about their role in B lymphocyte activation and human diseases such as lymphomas and autoimmune diseases.
Although more than 50% of all drugs target membrane proteins, the nanoscale organization of these proteins is poorly characterized. To learn more about the nano-islands organization of membrane proteins is thus of utmost importance for a better understanding of the action of these drug treatments and to improve them. Our study may also provide better markers for specific disease stages and could lead to new drugs influencing nanoscale membrane processes.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,244,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-05-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-04-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="p38Cancer"><Rcn>103689</Rcn><Nid>10909</Nid><HI>Fundacio Institut De Recerca Biomedica (Irb Barcelona), Spain</HI><Name>Signal integration and rewiring during tumor development</Name><PI>Manuel Angel Rodriguez Nebreda</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS4, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>Cell fate decisions rely on signaling pathways that integrate external signals to coordinate specific intracellular programs. One of these pathways leads to the activation of p38&#206;&#177; MAPK, which plays key roles in cell responses to many types of stresses as well as chemotherapeutic agents and oncogenes. Importantly, p38&#206;&#177; acts in a cell context-specific and cell type-specific manner to integrate signals that affect cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Evidence from mouse models and human cell lines indicates that p38&#206;&#177; can negatively regulate tumor initiation at different levels. Intriguingly, recent results suggest that p38&#206;&#177; activation may also sometimes have pro-tumorigenic functions. The molecular basis for the different functions of p38&#206;&#177; are not well understood but it is likely that the network of substrates phosphorylated by p38&#206;&#177; plays a major role. This project proposes to investigate molecular mechanisms of p38 MAPK signaling during tumorigenesis including the systematic identification of substrates and how they contribute to the different functions of this pathway. An important part of the studies will focus on the mechanisms underlying the rewiring of p38&#206;&#177; signaling to serve pro-tumorigenic functions, including in-depth characterization of how p38&#206;&#177; regulates the survival, proliferation and spreading of cancer cells, as well as its role in the interplay between cancer cells and stromal cells. We also plan to investigate the implication of p38&#206;&#177; in tumor progression in vivo, using both xenografts and genetically modified mice that we have generated to either inactivate or hyperactivate the p38 MAPK pathway. These models will allow us to analyze the role of this signaling pathway in the regulation of tumor initiation, growth and spreading in different tissues. Taken together, this project will address important questions on cellular signaling and tumor development, which might be also useful for more rational anti-tumoral treatments.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,497,800</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-07-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2017-06-30</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="p75ntr"><Rcn>188488</Rcn><Nid>12196</Nid><HI>Karolinska Institutet, Sweden</HI><Name>Understanding death-receptor signaling and physiology in the nervous system: A roadmap for the development of new treatments to neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma</Name><PI>Carlos Fernando Iba&#195;&#177;ez Moliner</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS5, ERC-2013-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and physiological relevance of death-receptor signaling in the nervous system and to harness this knowledge for the development of novel treatments to neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma. The main focus is on the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which is predominantly expressed in the developing nervous system and is highly induced upon different types of adult neural injury. Additional studies on other death receptors, such as DR6, are also described. p75NTR signaling can induce neuronal death, reduce axonal growth and decrease synaptic function, hence there is a good rationale for inhibiting p75NTR in neural injury and neurodegeneration. Recent discoveries from my laboratory have clarified the mechanism of p75NTR activation and provided new insights into the underlying logic of p75NTR signaling, paving the way for a genetic dissection of p75NTR function and physiology. These discoveries have open new avenues to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand-specific responses and downstream signal propagation by death-receptors, unravel the physiological relevance of death-receptor signaling pathways in health and disease, and develop new strategies to block death-receptor activity in neural injury and neurodegeneration.

To drive progress in this research area it is proposed to: i) Elucidate the mechanisms by which p75NTR and other death receptors become activated by different ligands and elicit distinct, ligand-specific cellular responses; ii) Elucidate the mechanisms underlying the specificity and diversity of p75NTR signaling and decipher their underlying logic; iii) Elucidate the physiological significance of distinct p75NTR signaling pathways through genetic dissection in knock-in mice; iv) Harness this knowledge to identify and characterize novel p75NTR inhibitors.

Instead a substantial fraction is transcribed, often tissue specifically, into long non coding (lnc)RNA of mostly unknown function.  Many lncRNA are rapidly degraded and may reflect promiscuous, non-functional transcription. However some lncRNA have important cellular functions. I reason that defining promoters and terminators of lncRNA genes will provide valuable information on which lncRNA are likely to be functional. LncRNA gene promoters often correspond to nucleosome depleted regions of protein coding gene promoters and enhancers, which generate bidirectional transcription. Regions of single-strand DNA, exposed by R-loop formation can also initiate transcription and so act as a potential source of lncRNA, as will be investigated here. Since transcription initiation of lncRNA genes appears relatively promiscuous, terminating lncRNA transcription may be of critical importance. This will prevent read-through transcription with consequent negative affects on downstream genes by transcriptional interference or the formation of overlapping transcripts leading to RNA interference effects. Consequently I will focus on transcription termination mechanisms of lncRNA genes. I will determine if known protein coding gene terminators also operate for lncRNA genes or whether many lncRNA use alternative termination mechanisms. In particular I will investigate the role of G-rich pausing elements that promote Pol II termination by forming R-loop structures on lncRNA genes. I will also investigate which classes of lncRNA genes form gene loop conformations when transcribed, as a likely identifier of more highly expressed, functional lncRNA. Overall I predict that understanding how lncRNA are synthesised will provide critical information on which lncRNA warrant scrutiny as likely functional transcripts</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,499,464</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="risk factors cancer"><Rcn>103200</Rcn><Nid>8962</Nid><HI>Lunds Universitet, Sweden</HI><Name>Genetic and environmental risk factors for common malignant tumours especially breast cancer and melanoma</Name><PI>Lars H&#195;&#165;kan Olsson</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2011-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>A prerequisite for prevention or early diagnosis of  a tumour disease is that environmental and/or genetic risk factors are characterized in order to better define risk groups. The present research proposal focus on common malignant tumours, especially breast cancer and malignant melanoma . By combining risk factor studies on endogenous and exogenous environmental, and genetic risk factors and its interaction, the aim is to better characterize  strong determinants of risk. The project also aims at better understanding the mechanisms of disease and for different exposures, such as sun exposure and different hormonal exposures, obtain a global assessment of possible positive and negative health and disease effects. The infrastructure includes large population based cohort and case-control studies, pathological and clinical patient information, biobanks from cancer patients and controls, availability of excellent genomic resources and an extensive network of national and international collaborations. Very often it has been possible to work out from a population based perspective. Both for breast cancer and melanoma the research group has identified important genes or modifiers of dominant predisposing genes as well as environmental or constitutional risk factors. Through an extensive international collaboration gene and gene-environemnt interaction studies are undertaken. The ulitmate goal for the new knowledge is to prevent or early diagnose the malignancy. In hereditary cancer and for some of the hormonal exposures successful results already are seen.

Roots grow in intimate association with a root microbiota that is distinct from the complex microbial community present in surrounding soil. A subset of soil bacteria is able to multiply inside roots as benign endophytes and modulate plant growth and development, with implications ranging from enhanced crop productivity to phytoremediation.  Endophytic colonization represents an apparent paradox of plant innate immunity because plant cells can detect an array of evolutionary conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns to initiate immune responses and terminate microbial multiplication. We have developed an experimental platform to characterize soil, rhizosphere (the zone of soil influenced by roots) and root-inhabiting bacterial communities of Arabidopsis thaliana, grown in contrasting natural soils under controlled environmental conditions. This revealed that A. thaliana roots are preferentially colonized by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria, and each bacterial phylum is represented by a dominating class or family. Soil type defines the composition of root-inhabiting bacterial communities and host genotype determines their ribotype profiles to a limited extent. The identification of soil type-specific members within the root-inhabiting assemblies supports our conclusion that these represent soil-derived root endophytes. I propose to apply reductionist approaches to examine microbiota evolution and functions within in a single phylogenetic framework of host species. Towards this objective, we will utilize a combination of genomics, cell biological and microbial transplantation tools.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,489,879</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-03-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-02-28</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="symdev"><Rcn>107913</Rcn><Nid>11241</Nid><HI>The Chancellor, Masters And Scholars Of The University Of Cambridge, United Kingdom</HI><Name>The role of symplastic communication during root development</Name><PI>Yrj&#195;&#182; Helariutta</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2012-ADG</Call_Details><Summary>The symplastic route composed of plasmodesmata (PD) channels and the transporting phloem tissue (rich in PD) is the major pathway for carbon allocation in plants. How the symplastic transport route is formed during plant ontogeny and what is its significance in conducting and distributing morhogenetic signals to the growing organs is poorly understood at the moment and is addressed here. My laboratory has recently made a breakthrough that facilitates the analysis of symplastic communication. In a genetic screen we identified gain-of-function mutations in a locus that codes for a CALLOSE SYNTHASE isoform CALS3. The cals3-d mutations result in restricted symplastic trafficking through the PD. Using the cals3-d mutations in a vector system that allows cell type specific and inducible control of expression of the transgene, icals3m, we have been able to construct a molecular tool, with which we can regulate the passage of the various signaling molecules between the neighboring cells. This tool has already opened several new lines of research on symplastic communication concerning understanding of the regulation of PD channels, phloem development and symplastically moving signals. By a combination of experimental approaches at molecular, genetic, imaging and theoretically levels we will investigate here:
(1) How is symplastic trafficking regulated?
(2) What are the (symplastic) signals specifying phloem development?
(3) How do the signals emanating from the phloem control root development?
(4) Can we predict new regulatory factors controlling symplastic trafficking in space and time, based on the experimental data (on the distribution of symplastic channels, symplastically controlled genes and symplastically mobile molecules)?</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,387,026</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-06-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-05-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="targeting_cancer"><Rcn>93932</Rcn><Nid>10035</Nid><HI>The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem, Israel</HI><Name>Eradication of tumors by targeting dsRNA selectively to cancer cells and recruitment of the innate immune system</Name><PI>Alexander Levitzki</PI><Call_Details>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS7, ERC-2009-AdG</Call_Details><Summary>We have recently shown that EGFR over-expressing tumors can be eradicated by an EGFR homing chemical vector, carrying dsRNA. The vector is PolyInosine/Cytosine (PolyIC) bound to Polyethleneimine-Polyethyleneglycol-EGF (PEI-PEG-EGF, PPE). We have shown that even tumors in which up to 50% of cells do not express EGFR are eradicated, due to the strong tumor-localized bystander effects, which involve the innate immune system. Using this EGFR homing vector we have been able to eradicate EGFR overexpressing tumors by either local or systemic application. Since the success of this strategy seems to be due to the strong bystander effects induced by the internalized PolyIC it is likely that heterogeneous tumors, in which only a portion of the cells harbor the targeted receptor, will be eradicated too, as shown in our preliminary studies (PloS Med, 2006). This strategy actually targets the innate immune system to the tumor. We propose to establish tumors in which decreasing portions of cells over-express EGFR and determine the lowest number of EGFR over-expressing cells that can yield tumor eradication by the lowest dose of PolyIC/PPE. The principle behind the success of the Trojan horse approach is that the targeting moiety, EGF, is tethered to the other components of the vector in such a way that it retains its native EGFR binding properties and its ability to internalize with the receptor. The composition of the vector is such that the ligand EGF can be replaced by any other ligand, if the appropriate coupling conditions are used, retaining the ability of the ligand to bind to the target protein and internalize with it. We propose to replace EGF by a number of other ligands, such PSMA binding ligand (targeting prostate cancer) and Her-2 affibodies. Although only a fraction of women who over-express Her-2 respond to Herceptin, it is likely that they will respond to PolyIC/PP-Her-2 affibody.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>2,054,340</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2010-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2015-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project></Projects>
