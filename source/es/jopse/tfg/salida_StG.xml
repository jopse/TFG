We believe that novel image analysis techniques will be a major enabler and driving force behind next-generation technologies, enhancing everyday life and opening up radically new possibilities. And we believe that the key to achieving this is to develop algorithms for reconstructing and analyzing the 3D structure of our world. 

In this project, we will focus on three lines of research:

A) We will develop algorithms for 3D reconstruction from standard color cameras and from RGB-D cameras. In particular, we will promote real-time-capable direct and dense methods. In contrast to the classical two-stage approach of sparse feature-point based motion estimation and subsequent dense reconstruction, these methods optimally exploit all color information to jointly estimate dense geometry and camera motion.

B) We will develop algorithms for 3D shape analysis, including rigid and non-rigid matching, decomposition and interpretation of 3D shapes. We will focus on algorithms which are optimal or near-optimal. One of the major computational challenges lies in generalizing existing 2D shape analysis techniques to shapes in 3D and 4D (temporal evolutions of 3D shape).

C) We will develop shape priors for 3D reconstruction. These can be learned from sample shapes or acquired during the reconstruction process. For example, when reconstructing a larger office algorithms may exploit the geometric self-similarity of the scene, storing a model of a chair and its multiple instances only once rather than multiple times. 

Advancing the state of the art in geometric reconstruction and geometric analysis will have a profound impact well beyond computer vision. We strongly believe that we have the necessary competence to pursue this project. Preliminary results have been well received by the community.

Joint degeneration and its related pain is a major socio-economic burden that will increase over the next decade and is currently addressed by implanting a metal prosthesis. For the long term, the ideal solution to joint injury is to successfully regenerate rather than replace the damaged cartilage with synthetic implants. Recent advances in key technologies are now bringing this &#8220;holy grail&#8221; within reach; regenerative approaches, based on cell therapy, are already clinically available albeit only for smaller focal cartilage defects.
One of these key technologies is three-dimensional (3D) bio-printing, which provides a greatly controlled placement and organization of living constructs through the layer-by-layer deposition of materials and cells. These tissue constructs can be applied as tissue models for research and screening. However, the lack of biomechanical properties of these tissue constructs has hampered their application to the regeneration of damaged, degenerated or diseased tissue.

Having established a cartilage-focussed research laboratory in the University Medical Center Utrecht, I have addressed this biomechanical limitation of hydrogels through the use of hydrogel composites. Specifically, I have pioneered a 3D bio-printing technology that combines accurately printed small diameter thermoplast filaments with cell invasive hydrogels to form strong fibre-reinforced constructs. This, in combination with bioreactor technology, is the key to the generation of larger, complex tissue constructs with cartilage-like biomechanical resilience. With 3D-JOINT I will use my in-depth bio-printing and bioreactor knowledge and experience to develop a multi-phasic 3D-printed biological replacement of the joint.

What generates its spin? 3DSPIN will deliver essential information to answer these questions at the frontier of subnuclear physics.
At present, we have detailed maps of the distribution of quarks and gluons in the nucleon in 1D (as a function of their momentum in a single direction). We also know that quark spins account for only about 1/3 of the spin of the nucleon.
3DSPIN will lead the way into a new stage of nucleon mapping, explore the distribution of quarks in full 3D momentum space and obtain unprecedented information on orbital angular momentum. 
Goals
1. extract from experimental data the 3D distribution of quarks (in momentum space), as described by Transverse-Momentum Distributions (TMDs);
2. obtain from TMDs information on quark Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM).
Methodology
3DSPIN will implement state-of-the-art fitting procedures to analyze relevant experimental data and extract quark TMDs, similarly to global fits of standard parton distribution functions. Information about quark angular momentum will be obtained through assumptions based on theoretical considerations. The next five years represent an ideal time window to accomplish our goals, thanks to the wealth of expected data from deep-inelastic scattering experiments (COMPASS, Jefferson Lab), hadronic colliders (Fermilab, BNL, LHC), and electron-positron colliders (BELLE, BABAR). The PI has a strong reputation in this field. The group will operate in partnership with the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics and in close interaction with leading experts and experimental collaborations worldwide.
Impact
Mapping the 3D structure of chemical compounds has revolutionized chemistry. Similarly, mapping the 3D structure of the nucleon will have a deep impact on our understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter. We will open new perspectives on the dynamics of quarks and gluons and sharpen our view of high-energy processes involving nucleons.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding /></Project><Project acronym="3MC"><Rcn>194553</Rcn><Nid>13938</Nid><HI>Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands</HI><Name>3D Model Catalysts to explore new routes to sustainable fuels</Name><PI> </PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), ERC-2014-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>Currently fuels, plastics, and drugs are predominantly manufactured from oil. A transition towards renewable resources critically depends on new catalysts, for instance to convert small molecules (such as solar or biomass derived hydrogen, carbon monoxide, water and carbon dioxide) into more complex ones (such as oxygenates, containing oxygen atoms in their structure). Catalyst development now often depends on trial and error rather than rational design, as the heterogeneity of these composite systems hampers detailed understanding of the role of each of the components.  

I propose 3D model catalysts as a novel enabling tool to overcome this problem. Their well-defined nature allows unprecedented precision in the variation of structural parameters (morphology, spatial distribution) of the individual components, while at the same time they mimic real catalysts closely enough to allow testing under industrially relevant conditions. Using this approach I will address fundamental questions, such as:
* What are the mechanisms (structural, electronic, chemical) by which non-metal promoters influence the functionality of copper-based catalysts?
* Which nanoalloys can be formed, how does their composition influence the surface active sites and catalytic functionality under reaction conditions?
* Which size and interface effects occur, and how can we use them to tune the actitivity and selectivity towards desired products?

Our 3D model catalysts will be assembled from ordered mesoporous silica and carbon support materials and Cu-based promoted and bimetallic nanoparticles. The combination with high resolution characterization and testing under realistic conditions allows detailed insight into the role of the different components; critical for the rational design of novel catalysts for a future more sustainable production of chemicals and fuels from renewable resources.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding /></Project><Project acronym="9 SALT"><Rcn>196865</Rcn><Nid>13797</Nid><HI>Universitaet Wien, Austria</HI><Name>Reassessing Ninth Century Philosophy. A Synchronic Approach to the Logical Traditions</Name><PI> </PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), ERC-2014-CoG</Call_Details><Summary>This project aims at a better understanding of the philosophical richness of ninth century thought using the unprecedented and highly innovative method of the synchronic approach. The hypothesis directing this synchronic approach is that studying together in parallel the four main philosophical traditions of the century &#8211; i.e. Latin, Greek, Syriac and Arabic &#8211; will bring results that the traditional enquiry limited to one tradition alone can never reach. This implies pioneering a new methodology to overcome the compartmentalization of research which prevails nowadays. Using this method is only possible because the four conditions of applicability &#8211; comparable intellectual environment, common text corpus, similar methodological perspective, commensurable problems &#8211; are fulfilled. The ninth century, a time of cultural renewal in the Carolingian, Byzantine and Abbasid empires, possesses the remarkable characteristic &#8211; which ensures commensurability &#8211; that the same texts, namely the writings of Aristotelian logic (mainly Porphyry&#8217;s Isagoge and Aristotle&#8217;s Categories) were read and commented upon in Latin, Greek, Syriac and Arabic alike. 
Logic is fundamental to philosophical enquiry. The contested question is the human capacity to rationalise, analyse and describe the sensible reality, to understand the ontological structure of the world, and to define the types of entities which exist. The use of this unprecedented synchronic approach will allow us a deeper understanding of the positions, a clear identification of the a priori postulates of the philosophical debates, and a critical evaluation of the arguments used. It provides a unique opportunity to compare the different traditions and highlight the heritage which is common, to stress the specificities of each tradition when tackling philosophical issues and to discover the doctrinal results triggered by their mutual interactions, be they constructive (scholarly exchanges) or polemic (religious controversies).

Recent ability to study accreting binaries in nearby galaxies has shown that we would be short-sighted if we restricted ourselves to our Galaxy or to a few nearby ones. I propose an ambitious project that involves a comprehensive study of all the galaxies within 10 Mpc for which we can study in detail their X-ray sources and stellar populations. The study will combine data from a unique suite of observatories (Chandra, XMM-Newton, HST, Spitzer) with state-of-the-art theoretical modelling of binary systems. I propose a novel approach that links the accreting binary populations to their parent stellar populations and surpasses any current studies of X-ray binary populations, both in scale and in scope, by: (a) combining methods and results from several different areas of astrophysics (compact objects, binary systems, stellar populations, galaxy evolution); (b) using data from almost the whole electromagnetic spectrum (infrared to X-ray bands); (c) identifying and studying the different sub-populations of accreting binaries; and (d) performing direct comparison between observations and theoretical predictions, over a broad parameter space. The project: (a) will answer the long-standing question of the formation efficiency of accreting binaries in different environments; and (b) will constrain their evolutionary paths. As by-products the project will provide eagerly awaited input to the fields of gravitational-wave sources, &#947;-ray bursts, and X-ray emitting galaxies at cosmological distances and it will produce a heritage multi-wavelength dataset and library of models for future studies of galaxies and accreting binaries."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,242,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2014-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2019-03-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="A-DIET"><Rcn>196851</Rcn><Nid>13613</Nid><HI>University College Dublin, National University Of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland</HI><Name>Metabolomics based biomarkers of dietary intake- new tools for nutrition research</Name><PI> </PI><Call_Details>Consolidator Grants (CoG), ERC-2014-CoG</Call_Details><Summary /></Project><Project acronym="19TH-CENTURY_EUCLID"><Rcn>87751</Rcn><Nid>9791</Nid><HI>University Of Glasgow, United Kingdom</HI><Name>Nineteenth-Century Euclid: Geometry and the Literary Imagination from Wordsworth to Wells</Name><PI>Alice Jenkins</PI><Call_Details>Starting Grant (StG), SH4, ERC-2007-StG</Call_Details><Summary>"This radically interdisciplinary project aims to bring a substantially new field of research &#8211; literature and mathematics studies &#8211; to prominence as a tool for investigating the culture of nineteenth-century Britain.

Understanding the physical processes that determine the rate at which matter accretes and energy is radiated in these discs is vital for unraveling the formation, evolution, and fate of almost every type of object in the Universe. Despite the fact that magnetic fields have been known to be crucial in accretion discs since the early 90&#8217;s, the majority of astrophysical questions that depend on the details of how disc accretion proceeds are still being addressed using the &#8220;standard&#8221; accretion disc model (developed in the early 70&#8217;s), where magnetic fields do not play an explicit role. This has prevented us from fully exploring the astrophysical consequences and observational signatures of realistic accretion disc models, leading to a profound disconnect between observations (usually interpreted with the standard paradigm) and modern accretion disc theory and numerical simulations (where magnetic turbulence is crucial). The goal of this proposal is to use several complementary approaches in order to finally move beyond the standard paradigm. This program has two main objectives: 1) Develop the theoretical framework to incorporate magnetic fields, and the ensuing turbulence, into self-consistent accretion disc models, and investigate their observational implications. 2) Investigate transport and radiative processes in collision-less disc regions, where non-thermal radiation originates, by employing a kinetic particle description of the plasma. In order to achieve these goals, we will use, and build upon, state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamic and particle-in-cell codes in conjunction with theoretical modeling. This framework will make it possible to address fundamental questions on stellar and planet formation, binary systems with a compact object, and supermassive black hole feedback in a way that has no counterpart within the standard paradigm."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,793,697</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2013-02-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2018-01-31</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="2-3-AUT"><Rcn>92475</Rcn><Nid>9838</Nid><HI>Kobenhavns Universitet, Denmark</HI><Name>"Surfaces, 3-manifolds and automorphism groups"</Name><PI>Nathalie Wahl</PI><Call_Details>Starting Grant (StG), PE1, ERC-2009-StG</Call_Details><Summary>"The scientific goal of the proposal is to answer central questions related to diffeomorphism groups of manifolds of dimension 2 and 3, and to their deformation invariant analogs, the mapping class groups.

Even less is known about diffeomorphisms of 3-manifolds despite much interest, and the objects here have only been classified recently, by the breakthrough work of Perelman on the Poincar\'e and geometrization conjectures. In dimension 2, I will focus on the relationship between mapping class groups and topological conformal field theories, with applications to Hochschild homology. In dimension 3, I propose to compute the stable homology of classifying spaces of diffeomorphism groups and mapping class groups, as well as study the homotopy type of the space of diffeomorphisms. I propose moreover to establish homological stability theorems in the wider context of automorphism groups and more general families of groups.

However synthetic interactions between genes are very difficult to identify in population studies because of a lack of statistical power and we fundamentally do not understand how mutations interact to produce phenotypes. C. elegans is a unique animal in which genetic interactions can be rapidly identified in vivo using RNA interference, and we recently used this system to construct the first genetic interaction network for any animal, focused on signal transduction genes. The first objective of this proposal is to extend this work and map a comprehensive genetic interaction network for this model metazoan. This project will provide the first insights into the global properties of animal genetic interaction networks, and a comprehensive view of the functional relationships between genes in an animal. The second objective of the proposal is to use C. elegans to develop and validate experimentally integrated gene networks that connect genes to phenotypes and predict genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale. The methods that we develop and validate in C. elegans will then be applied to predict phenotypes and interactions for human genes. The final objective is to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic interactions, and to understand how these interactions evolve.

However, it is now becoming clear that proteins can also be targeted for degradation by a ubiquitin-independent mechanism mediated by the core 20S proteasome itself. Although initially believed to be limited to rare exceptions, degradation by the 20S proteasome is now understood to have a wide range of substrates, many of which are key regulatory proteins. Despite its importance, little is known about the mechanisms that control 20S proteasomal degradation, unlike the extensive knowledge acquired over the years concerning degradation by the 26S proteasome. Our overall aim is to reveal the multiple regulatory levels that coordinate the 20S proteasome degradation route.
To achieve this goal we will carry out a comprehensive research program characterizing three distinct levels of 20S proteasome regulation:
Intra-molecular regulation- Revealing the intrinsic molecular switch that activates the latent 20S proteasome.
Inter-molecular regulation- Identifying novel proteins that bind the 20S proteasome to regulate its activity and characterizing their mechanism of function.
Cellular regulatory networks- Unraveling the cellular cues and multiple pathways that influence 20S proteasome activity using a novel systematic and unbiased screening approach.
Our experimental strategy involves the combination of biochemical approaches with native mass spectrometry, cross-linking and fluorescence measurements, complemented by cell biology analyses and high-throughput screening. Such a multidisciplinary approach, integrating in vitro and in vivo findings, will likely provide the much needed knowledge on the 20S proteasome degradation route. When completed, we anticipate that this work will be part of a new paradigm &#8211; no longer perceiving the 20S proteasome mediated degradation as a simple and passive event but rather a tightly regulated and coordinated process.</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,500,000</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2015-04-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2020-04-01</End_date></Duration></Project><Project acronym="2DMATER"><Rcn>104627</Rcn><Nid>10564</Nid><HI>Technische Universitaet Dresden, Germany</HI><Name>Controlled Synthesis of Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Conversion</Name><PI>Xinliang Feng</PI><Call_Details>Starting Grant (StG), PE5, ERC-2012-StG</Call_Details><Summary>"Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, which possess a high degree of anisotropy with nanoscale thickness and infinite length in other dimensions, hold enormous promise as a novel class of ultrathin 2D nanomaterials with various unique functionalities and properties, and exhibit great potential in energy storage and conversion systems that are substantially different from their respective 3D bulk forms. Here I propose a strategy for the synthesis and processing of various 2D nanosheets across a broad range of inorganic, organic and polymeric materials with molecular-level or thin thickness through both the top-down exfoliation of layered materials and the bottom-up assembly of available molecular building blocks. Further, I aim to develop the synthesis of various 2D-nanosheet based composite materials with thickness of less than 100 nm and the assembly of 2D nanosheets into novel hierarchal superstrucutures (like aerogels, spheres, porous particles, nanotubes, multi-layer films). The structural features of these 2D nanomaterials will be controllably tailored by both the used layered precursors and processing methodologies. The consequence is that I will apply and combine defined functional components as well as assembly protocols to create novel 2D nanomaterials for specific purposes in energy storage and conversion systems. Their unique characters will include the good electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical flexibility, high surface area, high chemical stability, fast electron transport and ion diffusion etc. Applications will be mainly demonstrated for the construction of lithium ion batteries (anode and cathode), supercapacitors (symmetric and asymmetric) and fuel cells.

In terms of performance supercapacitors fill up the gap between batteries and the classical capacitors. Whereas batteries possess a high energy density but low power density, supercapacitors possess high power density but low energy density. Efforts are currently dedicated to move supercapacitors towards high energy density and high power density performance. Improvements have been achieved in the last few years due to the use of new electrode nanomaterials and the design of new hybrid faradic/capacitive systems. We recognize, however, that we are reaching a newer limit beyond which we will only see small incremental improvements. The main reason for this being the intrinsic difficulty in handling and processing materials at the nano-scale and the lack of communication across different scientific disciplines. I plan to use a multidisciplinary approach, where novel nanomaterials, existing knowledge on nano-scale processing and established expertise in device fabrication and testing will be brought together to focus on creating more efficient supercapacitor technologies. 2DNanoCaps will exploit liquid phase exfoliated two-dimensional nanomaterials such as transition metal oxides, layered metal chalcogenides and graphene as electrode materials. Electrodes will be ultra-thin (capacitance and thickness of the electrodes are inversely proportional), conductive, with high dielectric constants. Intercalation of ions between the assembled 2D flakes will be also achievable, providing pseudo-capacitance.

Furthermore, we will use the Langmuir-Blodgett method to deposit highly ordered monolayers of monodisperse nanoparticles. Such structures show interesting transport properties governed by Coulomb blockade effects known from individual nanoparticles. This leads to semiconductor-like behavior in metal nanoparticle films. The understanding of the electric transport in such &#8220;multi-tunnel devices&#8221; is still very limited. Thus, we will investigate this concept in detail and take it to its limits. Beside improvement of quality and exchange of material we will tune the nanoparticles&#8217; size and shape in order to gain a deeper understanding of the electrical properties of supercrystallographic assemblies. Furthermore, we will develop device concepts for diode and transistor structures which take into account the novel properties of the low-dimensional assemblies.

Biological macromolecules and supramolecular assemblies are highly dynamic objects. Evidence that their motions are of utmost importance to their functions is regularly identified. The understanding of the physical chemistry of biological processes at an atomic level has to rely not only on the description of structure but also on the characterization of molecular motions.
The investigation of protein motions will be undertaken with a very innovative methodological approach in nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation. In order to widen the ranges of frequencies at which local motions in proteins are probed, we will first use and develop new techniques for a prototype shuttle system for the measurement of relaxation at low fields on a high-field NMR spectrometer. Second, we will develop a novel system: a set of low-field NMR spectrometers designed as accessories for high-field spectrometers. Used in conjunction with the shuttle, this system will offer (i) the sensitivity and resolution (i.e. atomic level information) of a high-field spectrometer (ii) the access to low fields of a relaxometer and (iii) the ability to measure a wide variety of relaxation rates with high accuracy. This system will benefit from the latest technology in homogeneous permanent magnet development to allow a control of spin systems identical to that of a high-resolution probe. This new apparatus will open the way to the use of NMR relaxation at low fields for the refinement of protein motions at an atomic scale.
Applications of this novel approach will focus on the bright side of protein dynamics: (i) the largely unexplored dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins, and (ii) domain motions in large proteins. In both cases, we will investigate a series of diverse protein systems with implications in development, cancer and immunity."</Summary><Max_ERC_funding>1,462,080</Max_ERC_funding><Duration><Start_date> 2012-01-01, </Start_date><End_date> 2016-12-31</End_date></Duration></Project></StGProjects>
